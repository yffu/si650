('train vals', "my sister, that i take care is displaying attention problems at school and at home. she recieves notes from school that will say not paying attention or not listening or not following directions. at home i have to repeat myself in order for her to listen to me several times. my dad calls it selective hearing, but i think it could be worse then that. i've read up on the home situation before and supposedly less tv and more interactive activities with her parents (which i do instead) will help her listen the first time. it's been helping a little but i think she needs more of a boost. i had add problems aswell as 2 other of my siblings, the sister i look out for is only a half sister, but she could have picked it up from my dad anyway.i talked to my dad about getting her add medication and he fears it will make her worse. 15 years ago my brother took add medication that had some weird side effects and my dad doesn't want my sister to go through the same thing.my sister is also just a kindergartener so my dad doesn't think it's important to have medication for the first year of school. i however think kindergarten is extremely important and i don't want my sister falling behind because of a condition that can be helped by medication.i was wondering if any of you have a child on add medication if they still have the same side effects they did 15 years ago? or any other information would be great.", 4)

('train vals', "for the past two months or so i've been experiencing pain in my head. it comes on relatively quickly and feels like either a sharp or dull, localized pain in my head. there seems to be no rhyme or reason to where exactly it hits. t's always in a specific part of my head but never the same place. if i scratch my head it tends to go away which is odd.i'm also almost constantly dizzy, sometimes off balance as well. i'll feel like im losing my footing although i never really do, it just feels that way. i've noticed it tends to happen most often when i'm exerting myself as in exercising or moving particularly quickly at work (i'm a part-time waiter). don't know if its due to increased heartrate or what but that's the connection i've made. my brain feels like its constantly in a fog.it should be noted that i recently (66 days ago) quit drinking cold turkey after 6 years of heavy drinking. the reason i quit drinking was because of symptoms like these that started manifesting themselves. after drinking i would get increasingly dizzy and off balance far beyond a normal hangover. so i quit.i expected a certain amount of withdrawl(withdrawal)but shouldn't i be through with the worst of it after more than 2 months? also, these symptoms started when i was still drinking (hence why i quit).i'm 27, about 20 lbs overweight, a smoker, and spend about 6-8 hours a day sitting at a computer. i also have a well-documented history of various food and seasonal allergies. i've had problems with my ears in the past as well. my ears seem like they're in constant need of popping but never seem to pop when i try to make them.any help woudl be appreciated. this is not so much painful as it is annoying. my head is in a fog, i'm dizzy, off balance, and getting random pains in my head. i just want to go back to feeling normal again.", 1)

('train vals', "an activist group funded by the billionaire koch brothers is planning a rally in new york on thursday to stand up to occupy wall street extremists.americans for prosperity will gather at the rockefeller center in midtown manhattan to demonstrate against occupy protesters and barack obama's handling of the economy.the occupy wall street crowd is nothing but a fringe element of malcontents bent on mayhem and destruction, said steve lonegan, americans for prosperity's new jersey state director.these are people who despise free enterprise. they are not attacking wall street. they are attacking the very freedoms that everyday americans cherish to pursue their own dreams and succeed.lonegan added that it was time that someone stood up to the occupy wall street mob.the rally, announced on wednesday, is part of americans for prosperity's failing agenda bus tour across the us. the non-profit organisation has three buses crossing the us, drawing attention to what it sees as obama's failings on the economy.the specific focus on occupy wall street comes after the movement celebrated its first anniversary on monday, although the occasion was marred by close to 200 arrests across new york.david and charles koch have poured money into americans for prosperity, which is tied to the tea party movement and has a focus on small government and low taxes.although americans for prosperity says it does not expressly advocate for the success or defeat of any candidate for public office, the organisation has run adverts targeting obama. mitt romney attended a fundraiser held by the kochs this summer.a spokesman for americans for prosperity would not predict how many people might attend the rally at the rockefeller, but the group's website claims to be more than two million activists strong across the country. the group has chapters in 34 states, according to its press release. attendees will listen to speeches from tim phillips, the president of americans for prosperity, lonegan and others.what the american people are really worried about is president obama's failing agenda, lonegan said.they are worried about a failing agenda that is saddling future generations of americans with trillions of dollars of debt and leaving them with a bleak future. they are worried about the economic destruction president obama's policies have had on the economy and on job creation.bill dobbs, an occupy wall street activist who attended the movement's anniversary event on monday, described the rally as an interesting development.but the rich want almost everything, they'd like to take just about everything in sight, he said. the 1% must be getting desperate to put their supporters out on the streehttp://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/19/koch-brothers-anti-occupy-protest", 5)

('test vals', "fox nation joined rush limbaugh in promoting a bogus link between support for same-sex marriage and the acceptance of pedophilia.during the january 7 edition of his radio show, limbaugh referenced a national review online (nro) column, which criticized an article in the guardian for highlighting the growing debate over whether pedophilia should be classified as a distinct sexual orientation.limbaugh - who has previously accused the gay lobby of trying to downplay cases of child molestation - attempted to link the growing acceptance of pedophilia to the campaign to legalize same-sex marriage:limbaugh: there is an effort underway to normalize pedophilia... i want to take you back. i want you to remember the first time, wherever you were, that you heard about gay marriage, and i want you to try to recall your reaction -- your first gut reaction -- when you heard that some activists or somebody was trying to promote the notion of gay marriage. what was your initial reaction? aw, come on. it'll never happen. that's silly. what are you talking about? there is a movement on to normalize pedophilia, and i guarantee you your reaction to that is probably much the same as your reaction when you first heard about gay marriage. what has happened to gay marriage? it's become normal -- and in fact, with certain people in certain demographics it's the most important issue in terms of who they vote for. so don't pooh-pooh. there's a movement to normalize pedophilia. don't pooh-pooh it. the people behind it are serious, and you know the left as well as i do. they glom onto something and they don't let go.[...]now, there were people -- i just want to remind you -- back during the early days of the effort to redefine what a family is, and in the early days of the gay marriage activists, there were people who said, well, if this becomes mainstream, then someday marrying your dog is gonna be okay, and then having two husbands and two wives in one family is gonna be okay, 'cause who can say it isn't?    there were others who predicted that pedophilia would be mainstream, and there was an outcry of opposition to this.the same nro column appeared on fox nation, along with an almost 14-minute clip from limbaugh's radio show:fox has a history of attempting to tether pedophilia to lgbt equality. fox's resident anti-lgbt pseudoscientist, dr. keith ablow - who is a member of fox news' medical a-team - has previously criticized the american psychological association (apa) for caving into cultural pressure to destigmatize homosexuality and pedophilia. and last august, fox's bill o'reilly defended the right-wing smear that child molesters are more likely to be gay.fox's promotion of limbaugh's comments is also surprising, considering that the network has previously supported the idea that pedophilia is a distinct sexual orientation. in a foxnews.com article, ablow warned that a person's sexual orientation could be shaped by environmental factors, such as men who become pedophiles after viewing sexualized images of children.http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/01/08/fox-nation-rush-limbaugh-peddle-gay-marriage-pe/192091", 5)
