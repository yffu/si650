('test vals', "my baby girl was born at 35 weeks to the day, she is 2 weeks now but they had me bottle feeding her pumped breastmilk in the hospital.    i want to get her on breast only but i don't know how to do it.    i can get her to latch and take occasional pulls at the breast but then she stops or falls asleep.    she takes the bottle but is even kinda lazy on it sometimes.    right now i offer her the breast then follow up with giving her a bottle.    it upsets me that the doctors want me to measure how much she takes to an exact science...when i get her to finally take what they want they up it again.    now i find she is spitting up a lot and idk what to think.    they also get mad at me about her weight.    she was 6.1 at birth then got down to 5.9 and thursday she was 5.13, they wanna reweigh her next thursday.    i'm trying my heart out.    my goal?    to exclusively breastfeed and stop the bottle.    how do i do it?    i don't want her weight to crash and how do i get away from the science of intake?    also she doesn't wake herself up to eat...i wake her every 3 hrs.    please help?(sorry for being gone so long i know i posted on this before..thank you in advance!)", 7)

('train vals', "my wife and i are trying ivf for the 1st time.    here is a little case background: we tried for 2 years with no success (she is currently 29).    her laparascopy showed no blockage or any medical defects.    the chlomide at 100mg dosage failed (poor lining was the suspected cause).    we tried iui and she responded well but it didn't work (could have been stress related since her mother nearly died during the time we tried).    we are now trying ivf, there were 12+ follicles but after a 4 days of 150 dosage    and 1 additional day of 225 treatments only 5 eggs have formed with 2 more smaller eggs possibly developing.    we were given the choice of continuing with the ivf or stopping and doing a iui.    our insurance does not cover anything, so i opted to continue given the fact that her lining looked very good, but i am concerned about her not having enough eggs, the 5 that were present were pretty good size but i know that some are lost during retrieval.    my question other than did i make the right decision is if she only has 5 eggs will this attempt even have a realistic chance of working?", 7)

('train vals', 'posted by daniel horowitzthursday, march 22nd at 7:00pmhere is a debt milestone that we surpassed this week, yet you won  t read about it anywhere in the media.    the gross federal debt has increased more under obama in just 3.2 years than it did during bush  s entire 8-year tenure.    and bush was no limited government conservative either.when president bush was sworn in on january 20, 2001, the total federal debt stood at $5.728 trillion.    on january 20, 2009, the day he left office, the debt had increased to $10.629 trillion, a jump of $4.9 trillion.    just 38 months later, the debt has increased another $4.954 trillion to a grand total of $15.583 trillion!    amazingly, $4.514 trillion, or 91% of the debt increase comes from the public share of the debt, which now stands at $10.8 trillion.we should also keep in mind that we are on pace to breach the $16.394 trillion debt limit before the november elections, even with the uptick in revenue.    that means that he will have amassed almost $6 trillion in debt by the time he, god willing, leaves office next january.    and it  s not just the $6 billion.    he has set us on such an unsustainable trajectory that we will never achieve a balanced budget without massive restructuring of government.    if obama  s proposed budget blueprint was allowed to come to fruition, the federal debt would reach $26 trillion in 10 years assuming rosy revenue predictions.as obama runs around the country advocating tax hikes for the rich, the media will conceal obama  s biggest milestone    one that no degree of tax increases could ever countermand....', 5)

('test vals', "my mother has had cataracts removed in both eyes and the lenses have been replaced by the restor lenses bilaterally. months later, her vision is now much worse than prior to surgery. she has no close vision (cannot read), her far vision is poor and she can not be corrected to greater than 20/40 and 20/35. her doctor is saying the only option is to remove the restor lens and replace it with a monocular lens.when asked about the risk factors vs. the success rate, the doctor goes mute. he cannot give any data on either - or will not. he uses vague language like there's a chance she will see better or there's a chance she won't. when asked for more empirical information, he said he would defer to an associate who has done a slug of removals, then would get back to us. he has never removed a restor lens personally.can you direct us to any information about the removal of the resstor lens? my mother is frustrated as heck that she cannot see as well as she could before this fiasco, and even more scared that she will lose her vision all together if she has another surgery. please help us fill in the gaps in information that her d.o. has left.ps i went to www.aao.org but could not access any of the referenced journal articles, etc.. without being registered at the site.thanks!", 8)
