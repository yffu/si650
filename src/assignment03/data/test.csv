8,years ago, at age 19 i got a headache that would not go away...after two weeks of this i developed a rash on my back so i made a doctor appointment.    i was told i had shingles (a small band w/ no pain)...suprised my doctor by being the second youngest case he ever seen in his practice.    was prescribed pain killers and scheduled mri w/no dye.    mri came back normal& was sent on my way. about a week later my left eye crossed in and freaked me out so i made another appt and stumped my pcp after being tested for tropical diseases, disorders and other blood tests so was referred to neurologist.    the neurologist did a series of tests and ordered another mri but with dye. again, normal--more pain killers and a eye patch.    i had regular trips to the neurologist and for about a month still suffered these migranes(migraines), & nausea (assuming due to the vision)-i did not get out of bed much..i thought this would be permanent.my neurologist prescribed meds for bells palsy as a last ditch effort to correct the problem before hed order a spinal tap.    after taking nearly all the meds my eye miraculously crossed back in normal and headaches went away,    my neurologist said i either had meningitis that the mri didnt detect or i suffered a small stroke (i was 18 and otherwise healthy).fast forward a couple years and i made my yearly trip to america's best eyeglasses and contacts for my eye exam and fitting and she freaked out and ordered me to go to the er b/c she said my optical nerves were swollen and i could possibly go blind at any moment...so i went and was paired up with the opthamologist on call and ordered to visit him at his office the next day because i could possibly have multiple sclerosis and he wanted to do several tests.    i did, i took what felt like a million tests to be told i have optic disc drusen.also, at age 21 i developed puppps during my pregnancy at 4 months pregnant (if that helps any) and i had a pda ligation @ age 18 months.so now i sit here at age 24 and wonder if all this could be put together to some kind of disorder or am i prone to these rare conditions.    i am just entering nursing school and am learning to be my own advocate but feel like no doctor will listen to me long enough let alone research my medical history.i still suffer frequent headaches but not of migrane(migraine)magnitude and usually goes away with naproxendoes this sound normal and pure coincidence or am i onto something?    please help!
9,my daughter will be 4 in august she has been potty trained since she was 2 but has recently started to pee her pants 2 or 3 times a day,,, she knows its wrong. she comes to me and says check this out and shows me she peed her pants, or says shes sorry. she has really been acting out for the past few months. she throws fits and will scream at me, slamming her door. she has even gotten to where she talks to me very disrespectfully she will say well i told you to make my lunch. she does act this way with others sometimes but not as bad i dont know why she is acting like this or why she is peeing her pants,,, any suggestions
10,i recently put a post on here with no replies...since my last post i have recently had a colposcopy and my doctor called me a week later and rather than giving me a follow up colposcopy up in six monthes from now she pushed it to november. for a minute i thought maybe this isnt serious but now im having doubts again... if anyone has any experience or knowledge on the whole cervical cancer diagnosis process i would really like to hear from them...you can read my last post to know more about my situation. i only just turned 20 in september and i have been with the same guy for 2 years now. so what does all of this mean?has anyone else ever had a colposcopy and is so why?how long dows it take to get clear results other than just 'abnormal'?
11,i have been passed from pillow to post, even told it is too small for the cyst to be causing all these symptoms but when i read to forums it seems to link.nausea,    tiredness, fatigue, bloating, pain on side, weeing a lot and my tum looks swollen one side and not on the other.    i was told because my cyst is only 3cm it can not be causing any pain.why will no one listen to me ?
12,i'm 2 1/2 weeks post decompression.    i have heard a cracking noise in my skull a few times.    my husband was standing near me and heard it also.    has anybody ever felt or heard a cracking noise?

17,i am 22 and after i had a baby (4 months ago) i went to ob for a check up. they took pap and after 2 weeks i think i got a letter that test showed changes in cells and i need to do some more tests because it may result in cervical cancer. ok, so they scheduled me an appointment in december. but.. i started having this stabbing pain somewhere in cervix/uterus sometime in august and didn't really pay attention to it cuz i thought it's just smth after the delivery. but because it's been going on and off for 2 months now, i am concerned... should i just wait till the appointment or go to my personal doctor?.. what it might be?( i had pap done while pregnant and it came out good)....
18,i was wondering if anyone here has levels of fsh and lh like i do. i did some blood work at my doctors office mid cycle, almost eactly mid cycle and here were the results:estradiol: 478 pg/mlestrogens: total 558 pg/mlfsh: 0.7 l (mlu/ml)lh: 4.9 mlu/mlprogesterone: 1.8 ng/mltestosterone: 87 ng (slightly high)i have extremely painfull periods and have been unable to concieve(conceive)for a couple years. i haven't really seen a specialist about it yet, but i was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to what some of my test results show. i have very regular periods, but they are very heavy and painful. i also have hair loss on my head, and excessive bodily hair. i've had an ultrasound done of my uterus and three small cycts were found on my left ovary and one on my right. my doctor said everyone has some and it's probably not the reason for my slightly high testosterone. just looking for anyone who knows what might be going on. i am 27, weight 125 pounds and have been out of work for a while due to very low energy.this discussion is related tofsh and lh levels at midcycle peak.
19,a few months ago, i had sudden pain in which felt like the tract of my penis about once a week. i then noticed redness just below the head on my upper shaft. i decided to go the doctor and she immediately diagnosed it as a yeast infection. she gave me nystatin cream to use for two weeks and it worked for about a week. then, it started to feel uncomfortable again. also, i noticed a small red patch just under the head. i returned to the doctor exactly two weeks after my original visit, and she was unsure about the patch. she said that she would feel safe doing a blood test and a penile probe. i thought that an std check was pretty much out of the question because i started having sex with my current girlfriend, now fiance, about 2 years ago and was virgin before that. she was thoroughly tested and is std free. the tests came back negative and the doc recommended me to a urologist. however, now i never feel any pain, but it the urinary tract is still sensitive at times and that small red patch is still there in the same spot. it never has hurt when i urinate, but every now and then a while after i ejaculate, it feels pretty sensitive. what could this be?

24,i got my test results back.    it is quite interesting.    last month my thyroid antibodies were above 250 and this month they (anti-thy perox) were 25 with reference    30)so he said monday we will discuss the vitamin d which is low and the marginal parathyroid results.    does this mean i have a problem with it or not?    from what i read, your calcium levels should really never be in the 10's and even with a normal pth is is suggestive of parathyroid issues.    is this true?    could this be why i am having panic attacks, raised blood pressure, headache and side effects to my thyroid meds?    once again thank you all for the help.    i don't know what i would do without you all.
25,hi there,can anyone tell me if there are any vitamins that they would recomend for ms ,apart from enening primrosethanks
26,i had my first migraine at 26 (now 36 years old) when i was active army and working outside.    i was seeing stars following sudden, severe, disabling sharp pain in my head that lasted 2 hours. i thought i was going to die and went to the er where at that time diagnosed me as being dehydrated and having sleep depravation.    i had about 2 migraines per year similar to this one for the next few years.later i started to get worse migraines.    i was seeing black spots, shooting stars, and streaks of lightening and complete blurriness along with confusion, feeling numbness in my arms and neck and head, tingling sensations in my cheeks and jaw, bitter taste in my mouth, excessive salilva(?), cold sweats, and nausea, following severe pain in my head for about 1-2 hours. i had this about every 30-60 days.    it seemed like i always had some kind of vision problem with seeing stars when around sunlight and bright lights during this time.currently, i feel like i am on the verge of getting a migraine everyday. meaning that i feel confusion, dizzy(unbalanced), eye sensitivity, and nausea with pressure in my head and neck, with a bitter taste in my mouth and the numbness - without always having the severe pain follow.    sometimes the pain does follow, especially if i am not able to lay down and rest.    it seems to help to completely rest and not skipping any meals and have snacks with lots or protein.my vision is normal according to the dmv and i don't wear glasses or contacts.is this simply migraines?    what else could this be?    i had a lump directly under my chin come and go in the last few years could this be related?
27,i am 18, and from age 11 1/2 i have experienced normal, timely periods lasting 4 days. about a year and a half ago i took birth control for acutane. i have been off birth control for almost a year now, and the first three months afterward i had normal periods. then they got progressively father apart and suddenly lighter. my last period took 7 weeks from my last, and started with light brown discharge that was very thick. as it went on it did appear more normal but was still very light. anyone know if this is something i should be worried about?
28,a number of years ago, approx. 1988, i developed what the hand surgeon, i believe referred to as a neurofibroma.    this was in my wrist.    only a few months before, i took a hormone coctail in preparation for invitro fertilization.    the physician took photos of my wrist at the time of surgery.    the nerve resembled a big earth worm that had swollowed several peas.    the growths could not be removed, as they were part of it.    the physician cut the sheath around my wrist to make room for the growths. although he said that it could not be determined, i believe that the invitro triggered the fibroma.also, beginning around the same time, but i don't believe to be related, i started having random experiences of tingling of my face and sometimes hands, and had trouble with vertigo? not sure if that is the correct term...a feeling like i was trying to walk on a rocky boat, especially after exiting an elevator.i had a test performed where they shot cold water in my ears.    i tested positive for something.    i can't remember what they called it, but i became very dizzy.    the neurologist said that if i wanted that he would get more agressive in tests to determine the cause, but i opted to just wait and see how i did.over the years, i have continued to have varying degrees of the symptoms above. (not the neurofibroma).    but, recently, the tingling has worsend.    i have tingling in my face, arms, hands, and feet.    i also have numbness in a portion of my back. i get the feeling that i am going away    this is my terminology of course.    i don't feel like i blacking out, or going to faint.    it is more of a feeling like i am going to have a seizure or something.i did have a seizure approximately 2002, but i didn't know it was coming.    so, i don't really know exactly why i am describing the feeling that way.    i think it is more from seeing what happens to a person who is having a seizure.    i feel like they look.    does that make any sense?the tingling comes in waves.    i feel okay, then the tinglings well up, almost like a hot flash.i know that you can't diagnose me from this description, but can you point me in a direction?i don't have a photo of my neurofibroma, but supposedly it was published.
29,i am a 29 year old female.    ive had allergies to common things and arthritis since the 3rd grade.    i was diagnosed as bipolar in the 9th grade, and really have had everything under great control for years.    i had my gallbladder out on 2/4/09 and the surgery went great. i can now eat whatever i want and have no digestion problems whatsoever.    one week after the surgery i got a pretty rough sinus infection and had to take three different antibiotics to get over it.    before i even started the second one i had started feeling like i was shaking.    my arms just felt like they were vibrating.    i was easily exhausted and would get very light headed.    the sinus infection finnally went away and most of the light headed ness, but the exhaustion has stayed and the tremors i cant see have gotten worse and sometimes i shake very visible.    just my arms and hand.    my muscles have started twitching all the time. kind of like when a dr taps you reflexes, my arms and legs are constantly doing that.    jerking and twitching all over day and night.    my family dr says she thought it was an inner ear problem but this just does not make sense to me .    i would appreciate any advice that anyone has. thanks
30,hi againa bit more help / advice needed please!have just come back from seeing the surgeon prior to next week's op.    i asked him what the chances were of malignancy given that my ca125 was 68 and has gone up to 81.    he was very non-committal - said that was why they were operating so soon and refused to be drawn - kept repeating they would need to see the lab results.    i know he's right but so often you hear of a more reassuring attitude. am i reading too much into his lack of being positive?    does it sound like he thinks it could be malignant? i'm getting a bit scared now ...thanksaydee x
31,hi !they say smoking calms your nerves, my experience is quite the opposite.    as an casual smoker and a high-strung person i f notice that in certain situations a cigarette can give me palpiation, light-headedness and abdominal discomfort.    one one occasion i definately think it gave me a mild panic attack.anyone else experienced the same?
32,my husband has fusions from s1 to l4 and nerve damage in his spine from the injury and stenosis. he has been on a variety of meds - none of which he has been able to take for any length of time - and now is back on motrin and hydrocodone as it is summer and the pain abates this time of year. the problem is he cannot sleep more than 3 hrs a night. he has lunesta but if he takes it more than once a week it does not work. he has tried ambien and rosearum. any ideas of older sleeping meds that might work? or anything that might work? he complains that his knees and hips hurt terribly at night no matter how he lays and this keeps him awake. pain meds at night are out of the question as they do not sedate him but wire him up.
33,its so hard to believe that my sister was murdered a    year ago this saturday the 9thshe will never see her kids grow up,    her kids will never feel there mothers hugs againmy parents will never see there baby daughter again!i will never share those sister moments as she was my only sister she was the baby....i really dont know how i am going to get through this weekend!its been a rollercoaster ride for everyonei am finding it so hard getting through this whole thingon monday the grub who did this pleaded guilty to murder thank god there will be no trialnow we just wait for a date for sentencing .mid:(
34,my boyfriend has 2 daughters (with the same mother), one of which lives with he and i in my apartment. the girl living with us just turned 5, and has seemed to adjust to the new situation relatively well aside from issues with sleeping (been with me for 2 months, and she had been living with dad and sister for a year, sees mom every other weekend)... she has positive reinforcement from both of us, she does very well in her new school, and her personality has begun to shine. there have not been any major behavioral issues, she is provided with honest answers as to the situation with her mom and dad and sister has changed. i work for a pre-school program, and practice parenting skills encouraging free spirit and creativity while maintaining respect for herself, the people and things around her... i am not too strict, but have much more structure and routine in the house than she is used to... with all that said, she has maintained a balanced transition... however, the past couple of weeks she has been waking in the middle of the night, (often times) crying and carrying on... her daddy works every other night, so some nights its just me, and others both of us are in the house... so that isn't an issue i think... she claims several different reasons for being awoken. sometimes its thinking that someone is going to get into the apartment, sometimes its a spider on the wall, sometimes its thinking she hears people talking... we can calm her down sometimes, but then she usually will come back to wake us or start crying again within 20-30 minutes (sometimes less). we ask how we can help, and she always wants to go into the living room and watch tv... most of the time this helps, but other times she will continue to cry and scream for me, her daddy, and sometimes her mommy... i am not positive this is an issue of night terrors, or if this is behavioral and bordering on temper tantrum... we, begrudgingly, tried a tv in her bedroom, but that wasn't good enough (didn't have the right channels, which sent her crying for 45 minutes)... she has spent upwards of 3 hours crying and screaming in her bedroom at 3am before, to the point that i intervined so that she wouldnt make herself sick... tried comforting, singing, reading new books, disciplining, letting her cry it out, all to no avail... hoping someone out there has some insight for a distraught daddy and step-mom...
35,i had staph a three weeks ago. they said the culture was negative when released from the hospital. i am on ivy antibiotic keflex    for six weeks.    meanwhile i had a nose bleed twice. could there be staph infection in the nose?i am also extremely itchy, tired . no temperature but at times my back is very warm.i wonder    where this is headed.the vegetation due to infection was found on aortic valve and on one of the pacemaker leads.they removed the pacemaker. i am back on coreg.i am hoping they can put the pacemaker in soon.    what are my chances of getting back to this i few months?
36,yesterday my new doctor started me on armour. i have been taking generic synthroid after having    a tt in january 2008. the adjustment issues have been a rollercoaster and i was hyper-sensitive to the synthroid as well. since i am    57, and healthy, my new doc suggested i begin taking (1) 30 mgs per day. my body was used to receiving 112 mgs of levothyroxine until today. is 30 mgs of armour enough or should i take 60mgs.? she really left it up to me and how i was feeling. if i did not feel well, i could call and she would prescribe additional tabs. any advice here?

39,hi all! i have been on here asking a few questions but mostly reading. i had some discussions with others regarding interest in the newer ips genetic screening process.    i had my first prenatal appointment today and have decided to do the screening as there is some history of down syndrome in my family and spina bifida oculatta in my b/f family also i will be 33 when i deliver.    my appt is april 24 and will update those interested about the procedure at that time.    i had my first ultrasound march 20 at 7 weeks 5 days heard a healthy heart beat and saw my little bean the screening will be a little extra peace of mind as i have had 2 m/c in the last 5 months but both were between the 7 and 8 week mark i am past this and am hoping this is a sign of good things to come.
40,hello all,about 18 months ago i woke up with what appeared to be symtoms(symptoms)of a night for lack of sleep.after several days it didnt seem to go away, and i still have the spacey detached feeling, onlyworse now. i have been to an ent, had hearing tested and was fine, along with pressure testing.left ear always has a full feeling, eustachian tube never seems to want to clear. headaches attimes, behind left eyeball, and other parts of the head, but always on the left side. went to adentist for tmj screening because i have some jaw    clicking on the left side. dentist didnt makeany determinations at this piont. my main concern is the lofty head feeling, and lack of concentration.if it gets any worse i wont be able to function at all. i also dont have insurance so it makes itmuch more frustrating and costly to get even some answers. any thought are welcome, thanks
41,my dad had a procedure yesterday (dye in the arteries) to determine the degree to which his arteries are blocked.    we now know that he is getting almost no blood flow to his legs.    he has an appointment with the cardiologist in 4 days to discuss stents and or surgical options.    he would prefer to have stents over surgical options.he has a trip planned for 3 weeks from now.    the trip includes an air flight and lots of travel.my question is this.    is it better to do the stents right away, in the hopes that he will be much more able to walk and enjoy his trip?    perhaps he should just cancel the trip all together and do it some other time or should he go on the trip, do what little he can and then come back to have the procedures done?i would really like some outside input on this.    this is a trip my mother planned and she is feeling martyrish over the whole thing.    personally i say cancel, why go on a trip that will be painful and exhausting?    mother says he can wait for any procedures until after they come back.    but i see that air travel is ok about a week after stenting, and i wonder if maybe he will feel like enjoying a trip by then....
42,my daughters were born at 33 weeks, stayed in the hospital for only 12 days.    one had a birth mark that grew very fast and we had a steroid injection given so that the growth would stop.    three weeks after the steroid injection, she quit eating normally.    she went from eating 4 ounces every 3 hours to barely an ounce every three hours.    now she will not eat when she is awake, only when she is sleeping and not thinking about it but at that, she stops eating after 2 ounces per feeding.    she is now five months old and only 12.6 pounds.    her twin is eating normally and 16.8 pounds.    she is on prevacid for reflux but that does not help us with her not eating while she is awake.    she just plays with the nipple and spits the formula back out.    can you help us?    she has only gained a pound in three months!this discussion is related toinfant feeding problem.

47,hi, i have a lump the size of a small pea on my scrotum sac. i have done some research but couldnt find anything about it, i thought at first it may be cancer, but it seems that for it to be cancer it would be on my testicle. please help.
48,i got diagnosed with hypothyroidism when i was four years old...i am now 34. i had been taking .175 mcg of levothyroxine up until about a month ago. i have been feeling horrible for over two years now. after several visits to my small town pcp and tests to determine the cause of my symptoms of chest pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, racing heart, feeling out of breath, stomach pain, and foggy brain, she diagnosed me with depression. i don't feel depressed...i feel tired and in pain so i refuse to take the depression medicine she prescribed. skip forward to recently...my husband and i started to see a fertility specialist bc we weren't having any luck conceiving. fertility tests proved my tsh was out of whack and they advised me to see an endocrinologist. my endocrinologist switched me from the levothyroxine to armour 60 twice a day and ordered a thyroid ultrasound. my ultrasound came back with the following findings...the right lobe of the thryoid measures 4.3x1.0x0.9 cm. it demonstrates multiple complex cystic nodules, the largest is in the mid pole and measures 1.3x0.5x0.7 cm.the left lobe of the thyroid measures 3.1x0.9x1.0 sm. it demonstrates multiple complex cystic nodules, the largest is in the mid pole and measures 0.6x0.3x0.9 cm.the isthmus measures 0.2 cm.what does any of that mean? i have to go in the day after tomorrow for a fine needle biopsy...i just want to start feeling better.
49,every resource ive looked at says that to be diagnosed with depression, your depressive periods have to last like 3 days or longer. is this true? if you look at my mood tracker you can see that ill feel severely depressed for an hour or so then ill feel bad or okay after that.
50,about two weeks ago, i got hit very hard on my forearm, towards the elbow. it was very tender and swollen for about a week, then it was hit again in the same spot. on the second week, my entire lower arm was filled with fluid. to the point where i could make indents in my arm that would last for several minutes.    now that fluid has gone down, but on the part of my arm between my bone and the muscle of my forearm, there is a very liquidy substance where i can easly push it around.    should i be concerned?

56,hi everyone,my period just started today, and i've decided to go on the pill with the approval of my doctor, so i took my first pill today. i'm on alesse 28 days... this is my first time ever being on the pill.i have a very important weekend coming up at the end of this month (august 31 - september 4) and without being on the pill, my period would have fallen right on those days. i really need to not have a period on that weekend - or at least increase my chances of not having it then. i have trouble gauging the probabilities of any actions i could take, so can anyone help me? even during the first month of taking your pill, does the withdrawal bleeding really come within 3 days after beginning to take the placebo pills?would i be more successful in not having my period over that weekend by: a) skipping the placebo pills and thereby trying to skip the withdrawal bleeding and pray for no breakthrough bleeding or b) taking the pills as directed, including the placebos, and pray that the withdrawal bleeding ends before the 31st? please speak from experience!thank you for your time!

59,over the last several years there were a few times that i noticed if i took a deep breath it would hurt very bad under the breast bone area of my chest were my heart is located. at that time i could only take little short breaths until the pain went away which usually only lasted for 1 minute or so. well now for the last two days i am feeling the same kind of aching consistintly but not as bad as the times that it only lasted for a minute. it is noticeable enough through out the day that i do not forget about it. please give me your advise. thanks
60,18 yrs ago i had a severe car accident.    i shattered my right femur as well as broke my left tibia & fibula & crushed my left ankle.    at the time they had to put a rod in my femur along with screws above my knee to hold the bones in place while they healed.    i've been told that over time calcium can developed in the hip area where they put the rod in, which can be very painful.    is this true?    about a week ago i started having pain in my right hip and lower back that radiatess around to the front of my thigh and shoots down the front of my thigh into the knee.    this pain has gotten more and more severe over the week.    it is extremely tender to the touch around my right thigh & buttock.    i can't seem to get away from the pain, it doesn't matter the position i'm in....and it hurts more if i have to stand or walk for any length of time...a lot.    do you have any suggestions of whether or not this could have to do with the rod in my thigh.    i also went to the chiropractor which give very little relief.

62,i am almost 6 weeks out from my radioactive iodine treatment for hot nodules and my anxiety is still very high. should that be subsiding by now? i believe my uptake was only 25 percent and i had one very small hot nodule and one that was bigger but still early. i guess i just thought my symptoms would not be that bad and i hope these mood swings are due to the thyroid disease. i am shaking and stressed one minute and crying the next. does anyone else have this kind of anxiety? would the hormone still be spilling into my bloodstream?i go back in one week for my levels and i am afraid he is going to tell me i am in normal range.
63,hi, i'm new to this site, but i hope to get some helpful info. i am very confused on what could be wrong with me. i am 30 and i have had problems since i was 10. most of the drs that i have seen have pretty much looked passed me, plus it doesn  t help that i didn  t have just one dr. anyway, i have a few problems that i know for sure. i have 3 heart conditions.....svt (about 200 and above), mvp, murmur. i have attacks where i have rapid heart beat, body shakes, hyper ventilating, lose awareness (almost like fainting symptoms), dizzy, light headed, and i get a flush feeling over my body.    i have no warning and no time to take action before they happen, i can sometimes have one or have them back to back.    i can go months without one or have them constantly, i  ve had two node ablations, insertion and removal of loop recorder, none of which have solved my problems.i also have degenerative bone disease (but i  ve never had any treatment for it), ibs, carpal tunnel, arthritis, and chronic uti.    now the reason i  m on this site is because i have a lot more problems that i  m worried about, i have constant pain everyday, i know it sounds stupid but it  s true.    my major pain right now is in my left knee and both my ankles, and my skin hurts at a light touch.    i can not use my left thumb; i can  t even open the door with my left hand.    i feel like i have creepy crawlers in my legs, and when i try to relax at night my legs jump out of nowhere.    i have a very high pain tolerance, but i don  t know how much more i can take.    i don  t have health insurance so i don  t know what to do, any advice would be wonderful.i don  t know if this helps but my grandmother does have fibromyalgia, is it hereditary?    thanks for all of your help.

67,i was diagnosed with a parathyroid adenoma which i was surgically removed. my have developed severe osteoporosis due to the abnormal functioning of the parathyroid, i also experienced severe aches and movement issues specially in my joints, hip bone etc. post surgery i found some temporary relief but two months down the aches and pains have resurfaced. i got    pth intact test done and it was 942.9 pg/ml, calcium was 7.8 mg/dl. i revisited my doctor who added some more calcium and now the calcium is 10.9 mg/dl, however my aches and pains and discomfort in movement is persisting. my worry is whether the parathyroid problem has not been resolved or is it something else and what course of action should i take.

69,i'm a 26 year old female but for several years now i have experienced what i can only describe as urinary leakage through the day and night.at first, my thought was that i was exuding some sort of watery discharge, but i later realized that was not what it was.it's very strange because i do not feel it happening, i only know that it's happening because my panties continue to become wet.i have followed all of the recommendations i have found for fully emptying your bladder (rocking back and forth when i finish urinating, kegels, etc), but that has not helped.does anyone have any additional suggestions for relieving this problem or know what a doctor would need to do to diagnose any sort of a problem that might cause this?

83,sunday, august 22, 2010news canadamuslim opponent of mosque reports threatby brian lilley, parliamentary bureauottawa - she spoke out against the ground zero mosque, now a canadian muslimwoman says she is being threatened. raheel raza, a founding member of the muslim canadian congress, calls the idea of a mosque within 300 metres of ground zero   a deliberate provocation.  last week raza joined maureen basnicki a canadian widow of 9-11 in attending a meeting about the mosque in new york city.  they were very arrogant. they didn  t answer questions,   raza told qmi agency.the meeting was hosted by daisy khan, the wife of the imam promoting the mosque and sharif el gamal, the man whose property firm owns the land the mosque is to be built on.raza says she asked questions about who was financing the building, estimated to cost $100 million, and whether any of the money would come from countries other than the united states. there has been much speculation that the mosque is being funded through saudi arabian sources but at the manhattan meeting raza said there were no answers.on monday, back in toronto, raza says she received a call on her cellphone from a man who identified as sharif el gamal.   his tone was intimidating,   said raza.   he accused me of 'jumping into   the meeting he called and then said 'may allah protect you.   i was shocked and hung up.  raza says she took the phone call as a clear threat against her.  why would i need allah  s protection?   asked raza.raza says el gamal's tone was threatening and she took the phone call as a clear threat against her, and not as it is sometimes used, as a casual phrase meaning goodbye. contacted at his new york office el gamal initially didn  t have much to say.   i  m confused by your phone call,   he said before hanging up.contacted a second time el gamal said   there was no phone call made by anybody   before again hanging up the phone to abruptly end the call.raza insists there was a call,   i saved the number on my cell.   the number on raza  s cellphone matches that of el gamal  s soho properties offices in new york.the proposal to build a mosque so close to ground zero has become a hot political topic in the united states.mauren basnicki, who lost her husband ken in the attacks on the world trade center, told qmi agency she originally had an open mind about the mosque being built so close to the site of the 9-11 attacks, now she is against it.  we all believe in religious tolerance. i don  t think for one minute that this is about religious tolerance,   said basnicki.speaking with qmi agency from her home in collingwood, ont., basnicki says many might be afraid to speak out for fear of being branded as bigoted but to her the location is just insensitive and she  d like to see it move.
84,i live in portland, oregon area and am wondering if anyone else on this list has a recommendation for a doctor in this area? i am looking for any doctors that specialize in mood disorders or bipolar disorder. i feel like i need both a psycho pharmacologist and psychologist.as an alternative, does anyone have a long distance (over the phone) relationship with a doctor? it occurs to me that if doctors were willing to do this, you could greatly enhance the possibility of finding a good doctor-patient relationship. heck, in this day you could even fairly easily have a camera setup where the doc could see you while you talk.i feel like i'm finally starting to accept the realities of this illness in regards to seeing the necessity of having a good team setup with doctors. i can see that this team is essential for me to do well, but i'm not having an easy time finding the help that i need. i'm currently working with a nurse practitioner that specializes in mental health, but feel that this situation is inadequate, plus i have no real counseling to help sort things out.all the best.

89,hi, please tell me what this could be.. i have something like a bump on the rim of my butt hole (forgive me if that is not the right word), it does not hurt, it's very small, about the size of a pore and looks like a pore, when i stretch out the area to get a better look, it stretches with the skin and it looks like there is a tiny white spot under the skin.. there is only one, it has been here for 2 months (that i know of) and it hasn't grown in size at all, it doesn't itch, or hurt, and there is no discharge, if i was not so paranoid i probably wouldn't have even noticed that it was there, by the way i am a female.. i'm very concerned, can some one please tell me what this could possibly be before i freak my self out even more?? i have looked at a lot of pictures of warts, but it doesn't really look like one.. could this be a wart, does it sound like it????

97,hi,my mother is in the grips of ocd/hoarding, combined with paranoia. she and my dad live in another city so i'm unable to help them. the psych. wants to see her only once every 2 or 3 weeks and has her on meds. it helped for a week and then she was back to her old ways.she obsesses about house work, hiding food containers under her bed in the bedroom, afraid that the maid will steal the food. they need the domestic help because they cannot manage on their own, but she runs off everyone who comes to work for her. she also talks at a 100 mph, is always stressed out and cannot finish a sentence without jumping to another thought.i'm tired and frustrated and angry with her for not following up with her appts and truly helpless to get thro to her. does anyone on this forum know what i should do to help her? i don't want to fight and argue anymore, but i don't want to stand by neglectfully and watch a beautiful, gregarious and charming woman suffer so terribly.i'm at a complete loss, and have my own serious health probs now.toby
98,hilast year in april i was diagnosed with severe gastritis and i did everything i could so that it would repair. then i started to get sick again. so this year in april i went back to hospital and thought that my gastritis had gotten worse. i was in hospital for two weeks and the doctors couldnt figure out whats wrong. they did find something that showed up in one urine sample which is related to an illness called porphyria but they didnt follow thru with it as it only showed up that one time. i found out that my gastritis was all healed as well which is great. i have a lot of symptoms and was wondering if anyone one is in the same situation as me.i am always feeling sick. and if im not sick with this im getting a virus or a cold as soon as i am in contact with someone else that is sick. my immune system is terriblemy symptoms arestabbing sharp pains in the top of my stomach and chestnausea sometimes leading to being sick after eatingpain in my right side and backaching in different parts of my body at different times so far arms, legs,backheadachesalways feeling gluggy and grossalways tiredeasily bruisesometimes getting a uncomfortable feelingsore bone painsmelly urine (when im really sick)shakesfeveritchy skin sometimesbroken sleepshort term memory lossemotionalalso i toss and turn alot in my sleep and joltdehydratedsweatingbody twitcheschange in urine colour to like a darge orange/redurinating alotalso when i drink alchohol or eat junk it sets of like an attack of me being sick for weeksthats all i can remember so far.i had about two months this year where i was ok i still felt it a little
99,my dad's lab report for his pcr test sayshcv rna quant. <43no detectable level of hcv rnathe report from solstas lab partners just says it ues a roche hcv    test kit by rt-pcr, but does not explain if it has a lower level of detection (e.g. 7 or 10 iu/ml) in addition to the lower level of quantification.do you know if a test reported like this will only look to 43 iu/ml and say und if below without checking for low levels of the virus below the quantification level? if they do check for low virus levels, what is generally the level?thanks.
100,my 6 year old son has alot of stomach pains, he constantly feels the need to urinate sometimes as much as 6 or more times in an hour(although he doesn't always actually urinate). his urine shows no signs of infection. his bloodwork is normal except for a elevated direct bilirubin. his other lft's are normal , his sugars are normal. i am a laboratory technologist and i had a look at his sample and noticed his serum was orange in color ( there were no signs of hemolysis). his total bilirubin was normal as well. i can't figure this out? help!!!!!
101,i have gotten pretty good at self talk when i have a panic attack.    my husband is also excellent at what i call talking me down when it happens.    tonight i had a pretty severe one after he was in bed that took a long time to get through.    it was that feeling of being unable to breath and actually scared me quite a bit. i am wondering how others deal with those?    any tips at getting through them?    i absolutely recognize my thought process at the time is irrational, it just doesn't seem to help in the moment.    i am just wondering because tonights was quite scary and seemed to last a lot longer then normal for me.    i would love to hear any extra tips or tricks the rest of you use to get through them.    thanks so much.
102,i just received all of my medical records/tests from my recent visit to the mayo clinic.    in looking through the neurologists exam notes i found the following:    cranial nerve examination was notable only for some pallor involving the temporal aspect of the left disc.anybody know what that means?chrisy
103,last year i started using lifetime fat free cheeses occasionally, then i sort of got away from them.today i went to a store that had quite a few varieties, so i picked up a couple packages again.    they are an acceptable substitute for regular cheeses, both in cooking and snacking.and you can't beat the stats:per 1 oz:cals--40fat--0gmcarb--1gmprot--8gmno, they are not as good as high fat cheeses.    but they are perfectly acceptable.    usually i use soy cheeses, which tend to melt better, but are higher in fat.for comparison:regular cheddar:cals--113fat--9gms!protein 7 gms9 grams is about 1/3 of what you should be aiming for in your total daily fat intake.    and this is for 1 oz only.so, if you are seriously trying to cut the fat out of your diet, look for them and try them out.    they are hard to find, though.
104,bi-polarity is such an interesting disease to me. being a medical student with bp, i'm constantly calculating my own moodiness. the most irrational thing about bp is the addictiveness of the high. the amount of work, calculating, inventing, and exercise i do while in a euphoric state makes it really hard to take medicine (i do but you see my point). it is a drug that our brains are chemically injecting into us. everything is beautiful, wonderful. the possibilities are limitless.i understand the danger, but does anyone else agree with me on this? it takes someone with bp to truly understand what euphoria is like. i don't think many people have or ever will experience that kind of high (without drugs lol). do you find it hard to take medicine when you are high? where do you place your focus and energy? what is the strangest thing you've done on a euphoric stint?
105,i am finally having another evaluation of my spine since my pain has gotten worse in the last 6 years. i have moved and therefor am seeing all new doctors also.this new doctor ordered a full mri from lumbar to cervical. but he did not order it with pre and post gadolinium contrast and mpgr like my prior doctor did six years ago. i did not think to ask when i was with the doctor and now i cannot get past his personal assistant who insists that the doctor ordered it the way he wanted it. she said contrast is for seeing scar tissue and since i haven't had surgery there the contrast is not needed. i told her that while i have not had surgery, i have had 20+ epidurals for other surgeries and 12-15 lumbar block injections all in the same site. the last few epidurals had such difficultly getting around the scar tissue that the anesthesiologist that placed it had to do it under fluoroscopy and had to go higher up in the spine. still she said epidurals are not invasive enough to cause scar tissue and the doctor will not order your scan with contrast even though your last doctor did.sooooo, my question is - how important is the contrast? is it important enough to cancel this mri all together and go see another physiatrist? i have no loyalty to this one because i am a new patient. i wish i could speak with him directly, but his assistant isn't going to let that happen. i do not know if my insurance will pay for more then one scan, so i'd really like it to be done right the first time.thanks,steph
106,hey everyone, my sister in law has been a user of percs and pretty much any other pain killer for the past 4 years. when i first met her she didn't do any drugs. she was a wonderful person who cared and love for her family and kids. five years ago she was admitted to the hospital for serve cramps in her stomach and was given percs and from that moment till now she has been taking them everyday. i have lost ever ounce of respect i have ever had for her. she has stolen thousands of dollars from her family and friends.    if something comes up missing she blames her 4 year old little boy. it's the most sadest thing i have ever seen. my husband has cut off all communication with her. she has done so many bad things to him he can't find it in his heart to ever forgive her. she has had numerous boyfriends in the passing years and remember one time picking up our niece for the weekend and her telling us how her house is like a revolving door for men. i was completely crushed to think that she had to see all this crap. she treats her daughter more as a friend than her parent. she talks to her dealers in front of them, puts her family down in front of them and talking very very bad in front of the kids. she doesn't cook for them and vary rarely cleans the house. she stays in her room and watches tv or lay in bed reading a book. she has totally shut down from life, her kids and friends. now it has come to the point of no return our niece has started trying alcohol, going to parties. talking to adults like sh*t and has the worse attitude. plus the amount of boys she has dated as she said is sick considering her age.i honestly don't know what to do anymore. she is such a strong manipulator that she makes people feel sorry for her which makes it easier for the people to enable her to continue use. her parents pay for everything for her and the kids. they don't fully understand what they are doing because they justify it by thinking it's helping the kids. my husband and i try and open his mothers eyes to the fact she isn't helping her she is helping kill her. she just doesn't get it. we try to tell her that our niece her granddaughter is following the same path as her mother and it's not healthy. that's when the grandmother gets defensive shuts down and gets so angry about my husband speaking the truth. he is the type of person to tell you how it is. i really admire that about him. how do we get his parents to see how bad his sister addiction really is and how much it's destroying their family. thank you so much for reading this story.
107,one year ago i had surgery, stage iiic followed by carbo/taxol- 6    rounds.    ca-125 went from 1300 to 10.2.    now ca-125 is back over 100 after 2 months.    went to osu in dec.    now having surgery on wed as my lymph nodes were not removed during the first surgery.    i am scared half out of my wits.    the nodes are located very close to the aorta, delicate surgery.    then i will have more chemo afterwards.    tissue is to be matched to most efficacious chemo for me.    or i may be a candidate for the ovature trial.    is anyone familiar with this?    peace, hope and good health to all my friends.    if you can remember, please say a little prayer for me on wed.thanks,sandee

109,for those who have treated with boceprevir. i am in a study currently and there is no placebo. some bottles of boceprevir have given me no metallic taste, and others have been very strong. i asked my trial nurse if there could have been some placebo bottles hanging around from a previous study that got mixed up but she checked the study number on the bottle and said they are all the same. anyone else have the taste come and go. perhaps i am being obsessive!
110,i have a question. while stationed in korea, i got a real bad cold, and had severe allergies at that time, and a few days after getting the cold, i developed shortness of breath really bad.    i went to the doc, and they said i developed asthma from the combo of the cold and allergies.    so i saw specialists etc, while trying to get better, but nothing really helped although the asthma meds help a little.    my actual question is this: if i don't have coughing or wheezing, but have shortness of breath and hot flashes alot, is this asthma or something else?    could it be some weird korean disease instead of asthma?    when i use albuterol it does open up my airways, but why do i get the hot flashes and not have a cough or wheeze? anyone have any idea? my doc won't listen to me, he says i just have asthma, plain and simple.    i am open to ideas, suggestions.    thanks!    b.
111,i was married to a man with genital herpes (5 years), but he always took zovirax & when he felt the tingling sensation, we avoided contact.    i have now been divorced from him for 2 years & just had an hs1, and hs2 blood test. my hs1 test was positive but hs2 was negative.    is it possible for me to still get genital herpes if i'm no longer having sexual relations with this man.    i've only had about 3-4 cold sores in my life (very mild ones beginning at about age 12) and usually after very long exposure to the sun. i guess my question is can you get genital herpes long after contact with a carrier?
112,hi, allsome of you know me already. i am the guy with symptoms without diagnosis. sigh, my story is so wicket, i sometimes get desperate.in 2002 i had risky contact with iv using girl, and some weeks after that had elevated alt, ast (100-200) for several months. retrospectively diagnosed as undefined self limited hepatitis. but for me it's clear it cannot be just some co-incidence.and now i find myself in the most difficult situation i ever was in:- i have lots of strange symptoms: (diagnosed!) palmar erythema, strange swolen feeling/pain around ankles/feet), occasional itching.- the swelling around ankles is still relatively moderate (perhaps 2-3 mm), but i feel they are swolen, and they hurt 24h / day.- have elevated bilirubin ~1-1.5 mg/dl (but mainly indirect one), so docs think it is harmless (gilbert's syndrome)- elevated bile acids (~20mmol, range    but here the strange thing:- all viral tests negative (hep abcde, hiv etc), by antibody, dna, antigen etc. in serum (and pbmcs)- two normal liver biopsies: 09/2007 and 03/2008. they say, zero inflammation, zero fibrosis, etc.- except bili, all liver params (alt, ast, gammagt, alk.ph, etc.) normal (betwen 10-30), except for inverted ast:alt ratio (but docs say this does not matter)- normal ultrasound + duplex (repeated)- normal fibroscan (around 5kpa or so)- no varices found in stomach, esophagus (i thought it would indirectly show i have liver problem, but glad nothing was found)- i had some 'swolen lymph nodes' but they turned out to be lipoms (fat deposit) after extraction and analyzis by pathologist.i hope it's not seen as cynical to put my proud stage0/grade0 results and negative tests on the board where many people are confronted with very, very different results. but pls. understand, i am really suffering and would do anything for a cure or at least improvement of my situation. so i am thankful for any kind of input. and the question for me is: if it's not the liver, what else??? what kind of doctor should i see? would an endocrinologist make sense?here are my compiled doctor reports:http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/files/1162323_slixs/anamnesis_en_mar26.pdfjoachim
113,my husband was diagnoised with stage 4 renal cell carcenoma in feb 09; we were also told it is the most aggressive form of the disease. after surgery to remove the kidney and a round of torisel we were told it had spread 25% in 3 months. it is also in both lungs, lymph nodes, on his spleen, and all over in the kidney pelvic area. the lymph nodes at the time ( in july) were also pushing up into the intestines. no one will answer my questions about what to expect at the end of this and even an estimate on prognosis. i feel like i need answere to some of these questions due to helping him with this transistion. can anyone out there help me?
114,i have had a sabaceous cysts on the shaft of my penis for many years. it caused a large lump on the right side of my penis shaft when i am erect.    several years ago i squeezed it hard enough that it broke and drained thru my skin. the cyst never filled again...the sack the cyst was in is still under the skin and the por of the skin that the cyst broke thru occasionally seeps a very small (pimple size) amount of foul smelling fluid. i worry that this fluid may be causing my sexual partner vaginal infections. i want to have it removed but am embarrassed and do not know which type doctor to see to have it removed. or if the procedure will harm my active sex life. i am a 54 year old male.

119,i have a tsh of 12.4 and my thyroid antibodies are 140. my gp has put me on a low dose of thyroxine 25mcg but i still feel unwell is this enough thyroxine?
120,i have a four year old daughter and she suffers from anxiety.    it started about a year ago when she started preschool and they had a fire drill.    the loud noise terrified her!    they have a fire drill once a month, and since that first one, she is almost uncontrollable when she knows there will be a drill.    since then, she had developed a fear of candles.    she is afraid they will make a fire alarm go off!    recently she became fearful of balloons because they might pop and make a loud noise.    for a year i have told myself that this is a phase that will pass, but it seems to be getting worse.    she can't even go to a child's birthday party because she will have a panic attack (she shakes, cries, hits, does anything to get out of the situation). i just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood and not worry so much about things like that!    how do i know if it has gone too far?    my instincts tell me that this is not normal, but so many others tell me it is just a phase, and besides, i wouldn't want to medicate such a young child.    i really just don't know what to do anymore.    it breaks my heart to see her this way.    any advice would be appreciated.

127,i am wondering if it is safe to think that my husband is addicted to masterbation(masturbation)?    he is harder to please with foreplay , his penis isnt as hard as it used to be very flacid. it seems to take quite a long time before he is aroused. we have sex and i saw him masterbate in the shower shortly after we were finished.(accidently saw this) and at that point i started putting 2 and 2 together.    i have tried oral sex and he will say i have to get ready for work, go to the shower and masterbate. we have been married 20 years and we are best friends.    but something has been missing and i think this is why its missing.i will listen to any advice. and btw i know that masterbation(masturbation)is ok..    my thing is that he isnt interested in me anymore. im feeling really sick about this and not sure how to approach this.. help please

131,hi there, i am a 35 year old female who has had numerous medical symptoms for at least 10 years which have been getting increasingly worse, especially in the last year.i get continuous headaches which range from dull to excruciating. i have had two worst headaches ever in the past year where i felt like i was dying.for the last 6 years i get a funny feeling through my head and i feel close to passing out (feels like a wave, or a black blanket going through my head). this happens 1-12 times a day and vary in intensity. these really scare me. i often get flashing lights and/or weird smells and tastes prior to it. it happens at any time of the day, even when i am in bed. after it i feel dazed and disoriented, i dont feel with it. this can last 1 minute up to hours. i have also had tingliness and weakness in body, mainly the arms and legs, and sometimes only on one side.i get small involuntary jerks of my neck and head.really bad nausea at times.tingling/pins & needles in my arms, legs and back periodically.weakness in arms and legs periodically.about 5 times in the past 10 years i have barely been able to walk. it comes on suddenly (its like my back/body seizes up and refuses to work), lasts 1-5 days on average.i have vision disturbances such as blurriness and haziness. (i have had my eyes checked recently and nothing wrong there).hearing disturbances such as muffling or ringing.sometimes i find it really hard to form the right words and sentences, i often lose track of what i am saying or doing, trouble recollecting familiar names and other things, and my thought process is slower than what it normally is.occassionally i can be quite clumsy (whereas im not normally)extremely tired at times, i have to sleep.loss of bladder control periodically.pain in joints which seems to move around from 1-3 joints, and then go somewhere else.my neck is often painful, as well as my spine.fine tremor in hands at times.when i close my eyes i can feel my eyes and eyelids twitching very rapidly. not sure if they do but it feels like it.sometimes in bed i wake up gasping for breath as if i have been holding it for ages.sorry about all the symptoms.    some symptoms are constant, whereas others seem to rear their head, stay for a while, go into remission, and then come back at a later date. it is like everything seems to move around my body and effect it in different ways. this has been going on for many, many years and it really upsets me and affects my quality of life.i had a ct scan of my brain recently which states that there is suggestion or irregularity to pineal calcification with a small cystic component (suboptimal assessment in this thick section series). the entire calcific and cystic area approximately measures 1.5cm x .9cm in ap and transverse diameter. this is thought most likely an incidental finding. no mass effect. the appearances are of uncertain significance. i see a neurologist in march, but after researching on the net for other pineal cyst sufferers, things look bleak.i was also diagnosed with osteoarthritis when i was 19. back then they said my spine was like a 55 year olds, but from the last scans i had it hadn't really degenerated too much more.i am really hoping that you can help me with all these symptoms or give me some sort of insight into what things it might be. anything would be sincerely and greatly appreciated as these symptoms are really starting to scare me, especially because they are getting worse. i have 2 children (one is 12 months) and im worried i might have one of my turns (a bad one) while driving with them in the car.thank you.
132,i have recently had surgery for excision of a urethral diverticulum, and have an indwelling catheter ( for 2 weeks only).    when i empty the catheter (dont have a bag, its a valve) the catheter judders and its sore.    also i now have a feeling of frequency and a sharp pain in my bladder when emptying the catheter.    i dont know if the is just part of the healing process as i only had surgey three days ago, or should i be contacting the hospital? i am already on oral abs.
133,my partner thinks there is something wrong with me. he thinks i have depression or some other type of mental disorder, but i have done a lot of research into mental health and i can't seem to find anything that fits. i know you can't diagnose yourself just by reading a magazine article or a website about mental health, but i've looked into the dsm-ii, studied psychology at a vce level and read quite a few articles from medical journals about it. my boyfriend has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and takes medication for it, and i've been to a few psychiatrist appointments with him so i know the signs of depression (the appointments were for him, not for me). i've talked to several doctors about how i feel and they say it's completely normal, but i'm an emotionally sensitive person. i agree with that diagnosis i guess you could call it, but the way i feel is causing a lot of problems especially with my relationship with my boyfriend.soo...i don't know what to do. he wants me to go straight to a psychiatrist but i don't think that's the best option. should i just talk to another doctor? he's written out a list of things that he thinks are wrong but i don't reckon those things relate to depression at all. i have mood swings and get angry and irritated very easily. i always feel lethargic, and get very sleepy at the end of the day even though i usually sleep fine throughout the night (my sleep can be disturbed by nightmares or sometimes vivid dreams). i get anxious, particularly in social situations, but not so much anymore because i'm going to university now and i've been forced into social interaction. it's just sweaty palms, feeling frightened and an increase in respiration rate so nothing like a panic attack or full-blown anxiety. i cry very easily and anything can set me off into a bad mood. my bad moods can be anything from feeling very sad and crying, feeling empty and just emotionless, very angry and irritated, or just a bleh sort of feeling.
134,i have had ulcerative colitis now for almost 3 years. i am approximately 30 weeks pregnant and have been having trouble with my colitis where i am not on any meds while pregnant. ijust found out my diabetic test came back abnormal and i am wondering what i can eat?? where veggies and fruits bother my bowels..yet stay full and healthy with my new blood sugar problem.
135,i took the test this morning, at 8 dpo.    there was no 2nd line within the 10 minute time frame.    left it sitting all day, then looked at it again just now and i swear i see a second line...    there's not much color to it, though.    i just don't know.    the instructions say results after any 10 minutes are invalid.
136,hey im 16 and have a lazy eye.the slanted eye happens in both eyes, but 1 of my eyes are always straight-not the slanted one.i can put my hand over the straight eye when the other is looking sideways and the other will become straight..i was wondering is there a easier way to fix this besides surgery, in a quick time matter?i was thinking, when i looking right into a mirror, maby 5-6 inches away, they both become straight (concentration?) so if i did that for a while, could that help the concentration, or is surgery the best/only way?thanks for all suggestionsif surgery is needed, please reccomend an doctor near tyler, tx if known.. thanks alot
137,dear doctor..i have been married for over a year and i havent been able to come out pregnant...but the weird thing is that i dont have my period at all i only bleed when i have sexual intercourse for a couple of hours.. my regular period i only get it about once a year or not one at all...i know that iam the one with a problem because my husband has two daughters..and i have been married before and no luck at all..what can be the reason why i dont get my period?? some people tell me because of my weight but i used to have the same problem yrs ago when i was super skinny....can it be that my tubes are blocked??and would i still have a chance of coming out pregnant??
138,i have this pain that will crop up in my lower left abdomen region.    however the pain only occurs like after a strenous walk with my dog or pushing a full shopping cart around the store.    if i am laying down, or sitting and such no pain.    sometimes the pain, or really ache feels like it also goes around to my lower back.    it is kinda like the pain/ache i get when i have kidney stones, but like i said only hurts when i do certain things, otherwise i have no discomfort or ache at all.
139,it is possible to become pregnent if a girl is having its normal periods after had sex in unsafe period
140,i am 38 year old male who for probably the last 20 years of my life have had right upper pains. i had my gallbladder removed and the pain is still there. i have had a ercp and they said the duct was tight and they cut it to open it up. i was ok for like 3 months and now the pain is back again. i have lost my job due to me missing time because of pain. i can not live a normal life this pain has a hold on me and no one knows what it is. after some research i came across sod and sounds like what i have but how can i be for sure? i have no insurance now. thanks
141,this probably isn't the right place for this, but i figure you gals know me pretty well by now, & most of my friends are guys or aren't married so they don't really understand.so my mil & i have never really gotten along, & they are coming to visit this thurs. i'm always being accused of harboring my negative feelings for her, & letting them come up in small ways by making cutting remarks, so i just sent her an email to get everything off my chest before she gets here. she is very self-absorbed & selfish -she's the type of person you can tell is not listening to a word you're saying, only waiting for you to pause so she can take over the conversation again & talk about herself. this is a woman who bought a brand new bmw 4 mo before our wedding & then said she had no money to help w/our wedding.    meanwhile, she never drove it!!! it sat in her driveway for over 2 years and had less than 1000 miles on it. so my parents helped us, who have remortgaged their house so many times to pay for my 3 sisters to go to school, that they won't have it paid off til their 80's (but my mil has almost 1 million in the bank and no mortgage!!! but of course, no money to help w/the wedding!)anyway, i digress... that's just a small sampling of the kind of person she is.    the thing i'm upset about is that she does not give a flying f*#k about the creation of her future grandchild.    she could absolutely care less.    she never asks how it's going, & even if we tell her something serious is going on, she never bothers to find out how things went. i even emailed her earlier this wk about my low numbers & how this was our first possible chance...do you think she bothered to find out what happened?    no!!! i just feel like even the women on this forum who i've never met care more about my future baby than she does, & it's really hurtful to me. i know i can't change her, that she will always be completely self-absorbed, but it still hurts.
142,http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/paul-ryan-chicago-teacher-strike-stand-rahm-emanuel-211106035--election.htmlromney and ryan aren't going to go into chicago and steal votes.    i'm sure the realize that.    so maybe this is a genuine notion, that they do see eye to eye with rahm.personally, i do feel that most educators within the public school system are underpaid.    (exception is locally) i heard on hln i believe on sunday that educators want a raise and an offer of 2% over 2-4 years was offered.    i'd be slightly offended by that offer.the majority of the teachers i had growing up were all about the children.    i remember teachers working without a contract for a period of time.    their wages were stuck where they were, but the teachers were in the classroom teaching.

148,not sure if this is the correct forum though it is a breast feeding forum. thing is am asking tips on weaning. i am currently 15 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child. i am still breast feeding my 18 month old. doctor said it was ok to nurse while preg and that the milk supply will either eventually dry up before giving birth or the taste will change and my baby wont like it anymore. i do notice the supply has gone down greatly and they dont full up by the end of they day the way they use to. what he ***** is just whats left.    but heres the thing, now that am pregnant, my boobs are sore and tender and soooo sore when he is nursing. he still wakes up at nite to suck for comfort and i am also trying to get him sleeping through the night before the new baby comes. when he nurses its always for comfort. he is a very healthy boy and eats solids everyday. i dont want to just suddenly stop, though people say i should let him cry it out or supply him with a sippy cup or bottle through the night, but itsnt that just supplying him with another type of comfort that he will wake up through the night for? sorry this is so lengthly. just need some sort of tips soon! thanks ladies.
149,my child has doose syndrome.    he is on keppra very low dose which we are weaning as altho it seems to control nocturnal sz's it has aggravated his perseverative behaviours and defiance.    he is tenex for attention which he tolerates well and seems to helps somewhat with his attention.    melatonin and remeron have been suggested to help him sleep.    he seems to have night terrors and does not sleep well / is restless.        he also only sleeps for about8 hours at the most.    any thoughts?
150,my son has pseudotumor cerebri and has an lp programable shunt. he was diagnosed in '99 his last shunt was in 2002. in the last few weeks he has seen an increase head and neck pain that do not go away with laying down.    we were at the er last week they said the ct    was in normal range the fluid and ventricles. xray show the shunt in one piece. four days later i went and had his eyes diolated they said he had the start of papilledema so we went back to the er they saw the papilledema too and put my son on diamox.    the next day my son had leg pain and when he went to stand it felt like one leg was shorter than the other this lasted 10-15 min. a few hours later tingling in the mouth and nose started.    the neurologist agreed to see him and they stopped the diamox. he set up an appt to have the eyes diolated again. then on friday he is going to have a spinal tap done. the neurologist feels my son might not have pseudotumor cerebri but chronic daily headaches. i am concerned that this might be the shunt malfunctioning and or the start of chiari.    he doesn't see a chiari on the ct. we don't have a recent mri. any thoughts?!
151,i have developed wrinkles on my finger knuckles over the last eight months(both the hands). the skin on the knuckles and the finger joints has been turning dark since then. i have visited a dermatologist and he said that it's not a symptom of any disease and hasn't prescribed any medication. i started using the l'oreal creams and all but nothing changed. the dark skin and the wrinkles look distinctly visible. i am loosing sleep over this because i don't know what to do.    please advice what's the treatment/remedy for this problem.
152,i am 37 years old and i have 3 children. i have not had sex in over 2 years. why am i having menstrual cramps and white discharge, but my period is 2 weeks late?
153,i have had itchy arm syndrom(syndrome) for 2 years now.    i had it last fall on my right arm and it has started again this summer only on my left arm!    last year it seemed to go away all by itself after using creams and ointments for weeks to no avail.    i remember one night waking up in the wee hours with my right arm itching so bad i stood in the middle of the room gouging at it with my nails and stamping my feet it itched so badly!    i was living on antihistimines!    they helped, but i hate the way they make me feel!for several years i had been aware of a sensitivity to fabric softeners and some detergents - before the itchy arm started i had been suffering from a sore on the inside of my right cheek and sometimes on the tip of my tongue.    the intensity would rise and fall, but they never went away.    my mouth was often so sore i didn't want to talk or eat.    brushing my teeth was very painful.    it was definitely interfering with my life.    i had biopsies done fearing oral cancer.    thank god, they were negative.    i finally figured out it was both the fabric softener and the detergent i had been using.    i discontinued the fabric softener and switched to arm & hammer dye and perfume free detergent - the sores went away!    every so often a garment i had not rewashed would surface and i would immedately feel the sore spots, but a change of clothes would solve the problem!when the itchy arm started, i eliminated the detergent angle because of my previous experience and the fact that i had already switched to the less irritating product.    so last year i suffered greatly until it spontaneously stopped.    this year when it started again,    after several weeks of suffering, i found the common thread!    each year in late summer or early fall when our natural spring water supply is low and we are conserving water, i set my clothes washer to a setting which eliminates an extra rinse!    this year, after doing so, my itchy arm came back - so i turned the extra rinse back on and when i wear the clothes i have rewashed, my arm doesn't itch - when i put on something i haven't rewashed, it itches like crazy!    mystery solved!for all you folks with itching arms, one or both, try eliminating fabric softener, and go to perfume and dye free detergents.    use the minimum amount of detergent to clean your clothes, and make sure it is thoroughly rinsed out - add an extra rinse to your washing cycle if necessary!    it has taken me a few years, but i have discovered this solves my itchy arm syndrom(syndrome)!    can't hurt to try it, but give it a fair test.    if you don't want to rewash everything you own immediately, wash enough complete sets of clothes to last a few days.    start the experiment with a shower ( i use all dye and perfume free soaps now), then put on your chemical free clothes and see if the itch doesn't dissipate immediately!i don't understand why, but my experience tells me that it doesn't matter what part of your body comes in contact with the chemical that one is sensitive to, the allergy manifests itself    elsewhere.    my first experience with this was many years ago - my left breast was itching all the time.    i looked in my bra for some foreign object - nothing.    i washed and washed them thinking i might have an allergy to the soap that they had been washing in - nothing.    finally, i discovered the culprit - i was showering with dial soap - i quite using dial soap, changing to a soap for sensitive skin, and the itch stopped!    if i go back to dial - the itch on my left breast starts again!if you want your dermatologist to think you are crazy, run that one by them!this discussion is related toitchy arms.
154,case historythe patient was born on 7.12.1983 at dr rml hospital, delhi. it was detected that the child was passing urine per anus and rarely per urethra (in a thin stream). it was diagnosed as anal stenosis and recto-urethral fistula. thereafter child was treated as follows:1.
155,hi- i have a couple of questions so i think i'll post 2 messages. am very worried. on last sonogram, there is a small nodule of about 1 centimeter. the said they can't tell if its a polyp or a fibroid. it's location is in the canal which i think is close to the cervix (this is in addition to 4 fibroids that were found; 1 year go, there were 2 fibroids, and 2 years ago, there was 1. the largest one is 3cm up from 2.5 last year. there's a combination of subserserosal and submucosal.)although for    most people, the gyn would recommend an endometrial biopsy, she is trying to spare me and get more info first. she says iget too much pain with just the speculum and she does not think i would be able to tolerate it. i think she just doesnt want a rough day -she'd prefer i'd have a d&c under general, but i do not want this.anyway, she says maybe a transvaginal sonogram would be able to tell whether the nodule was a polyp or fibroid. i only had the regular pelvic transabdominal one so far. but is this really true? i thought it is very hard to tell the differece between polyp and fibroidif you have    a small one which is submucosal, even on transvaginal exam. another words, i don't know ifit would help at all. i would rather not waste time, energy,, and discomfort (and cleanliness issues) if its useless. i am not sexually active right now and think it would be painful and difficult (i did one years ago and hated it. the report did notinclude the thickness of the endometrial liining, though did say the rest of the endometrium looked normal.i have plenty of symptoms; periods are very heavy, am anemic, they last at least7 days and are coming every 24 days. i am 50 years old, so likely just another 2 years of this... but besides the nodule, these are also symptoms of endometrial canncer, if one were being careful, they would do more invasive tests. but again, biopsies and threading things thru catheter thru my cervix i am tryingto avoid because of general health issue; eventually i may not be able to avoid it.back to question - does anyone know if transvaginal us really might be able to tell the difference given how hard they are to disinguish- or am i just wasting precious energy/time?thanks
156,i've been diagnosed with gm a    few weeks back, have had two surgeries to drain the abscess. my tissue culture grew an organism, so he thinks there's a possiblity of bacterial infection and so wants me to start on zyvox / vancomycin. if it doesn't get better he suggested getting prednisone. after reading thru' all the replies, i am very cautious on starting prednison. i do not have any pain as of now. has anyone else been on zyvox / vancomycin (it costs a lot)
157,i had my yearly mammo this past week. got a call from my dr office saying i need another and a ultrasound. i am 45 years old never had to return for a follow up. the nurse said its 7mm about the size of grain of rice. and for me not to worry. i go back in 2 weeks. the nurse said that sence i had my mammo durning my period and that i drink caffeine this could be the reason. i have never heard of this before and no one has ever told me not to get a mammogram durning menstrual.    so now i am freaking out what the 7mm dense nodular could be! its going to be a long 2 weeks. any advise would be much welcome!!!
158,after my last post i started laughing at myself. its funny how something can happen in your life (like a miscarriage) and next thing you know a whole bunch of strangers that you still haven't even met know when you should be due for af.once again than you all for being there for me through this!!!!!
159,my throats been bothering me for about a week now. i went to my pediatric doctor(though i'm 17) and she perscriped azithromycin; i think that's the name. i've taken 4 pills of the 5 she gave me, and haven't skipped any doses or anything, but my throat doesn't look much better. it's swollen with white looking places on them, which i suppose is infection. i just thought it should be cleared up by now, and there's still a little pain sometimes. but the pain is not near as bad as it was before. what's freaking me out is that my left tonsil looks like it's shriveling up, literally. it's weird.... and my right tonsil is really swollen. any clue as to what i might have?thank you.
160,walgreens won't sell over-the-counter genetic test after fda raises questionsby rob steinwashington post staff writerthursday, may 13, 2010the nation's largest drugstore chain backed out wednesday of plans to sell a saliva test that promised to scan a customer's dna to assess his or her risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and a host of other diseases.walgreens had planned to offer the pathway genomics test at more than 6,000 of its 7,500 stores nationwide beginning friday, but it reversed course after the food and drug administration questioned whether the test could be sold legally without the agency's authorization.in light of the fda contacting pathway genomics about its genetic test kit and anticipated ongoing discussions between the two parties, we've elected not to move forward with offering the pathway product to our customers until we have further clarity on this matter, said jim cohn, a walgreens spokesman.the washington post reported tuesday about plans by pathway and walgreens to start selling the over-the-counter test. pathway said its insight test could evaluate a propensity for developing medical conditions such as alzheimer's disease, diabetes and obesity; the likelihood of parenting a baby with cystic fibrosis, tay-sachs disease and other genetic disorders; and the possible reaction to caffeine, cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood thinners and other medications.other companies have been selling on the internet tests that can analyze genes for a person's risk of some diseases, and genetic tests for paternity and ancestry have been widely available in stores. but the plan by pathway genomics of san diego represented the boldest move yet to bring personalized genomic science to the mass market.it was welcomed by those who hope that deciphering the genetic code will launch a new era in biomedical science. but it raised objections from those who worried that the average consumer would have problems interpreting the results, leading to dangerous complacency about some diseases or unnecessary alarm, as well as opening the door to privacy violations, genetic discrimination and other problems.an fda official told the post on monday that the test required the agency's authorization because it involved consumers collecting their own dna. company officials disputed that, saying the test was exempt from fda oversight because the testing was being done at its own lab.but in a letter to pathway released by the agency late wednesday, the fda's james l. woods notified the company that the test appears to meet the definition of a device under federal law, therefore making it subject to the agency's review.if you do not believe that you are required to obtain fda clearance or approval . . . please provide us with the basis for that determination, the letter stated.in a statement wednesday, pathway said: we respect and understand walgreens' decision, and we are communicating with the fda about the test.experts have long called for the fda to regulate the burgeoning field of genetic testing more aggressively, and some speculated that the agency's move could mark a change in policy.walgreens is clearly acting in the interest of its customers by postponing the introduction of the pathway product, said sharon terry of the genetic alliance, an advocacy and research group. the fda, for its part, must be the guardian of safety and efficacy, all the while encouraging innovation and the benefits that genetics can bring to medicine.

163,my son is 23 years old with mixed cp.    he is in a wheelchair, is moderately mr, is selectively verbal, can feed himself, but is dependent on my husband and i for all other adl's.    about once a week, for no reason at all, he will become very agitated, extends up in his wheelchair and starts yelling like he is very mad.    it only lasts for about a minute or two and then he acts perfectly normal afterward.    he's been tested in the past for seizures and was found to be seizure free.    he takes miralax daily so we know it's not a constipation problem as he is very regular.    we have concluded this is a behavior issue but we are wondering if anyone else out there has a child that does this??

165,hello, currently i am experiencing dark brown discharge and i am worried. its been happening for the past 2 weeks. very itchy and painful when having sex and passing urine. do i need to go to the doctors?
166,in 2003 i was diagnosed with hashimoto's disease, since then i take my medicins. nothing went wrong until a couple of months when my doctor told me to lower the medicins, which i did. i use thyrax (dutch name don't know the english name, sorry) and i had to lower from 150 till 100 and then on to 75 mcg a day. with 100 mcg a day my tsh was 0,02 so i had to lower again to 75 mcg a day. my blood is checked every week now and my tsh went from 0,02 tot 10 to 13 to 18 to 20 dropped to 15 to 10 and three weeks ago to 2. yesterday it went up again to 23 and my ft4 is doing well and is regularly steade (13, 15, 16). i am not feeling sick or whatever. but it worries me a lot that my tsh is behaving like a rolling coaster. my doctor asked me if i do take my medicine (yes). could it be that i have a adenoma or something like that in my pituary??this discussion is related tohigh tsh and antibodies but normal ft4.
167,i noticed recently that the base of my penis is red, very damp, and shiny from the dampness. i got ointment for jock itch because that is what a dermatologist told me it was. this morning i noticed small pimple-like bumps in the red area on my penis. i read somewhere that bumps in a moist area can be genital warts. the girl that i have had sex said that i was her first time and that does not have any stds. do i have gential(genital)warts or just jock itch?
168,my x-husband left our 18yr marriage 4 years ago, leaving me with my three children (at the time 11, 7 and 4). i left our home with my children to begin a fresh new start. he moved his girlfriend and three young children in the home we left, in my childrens bedrooms.. etc. he was remarried within a year taking on a huge role as a new father of 6!i have had awful behaviorial issues with my kids, my now 7yr old is doing much better (although is very wild) my 11 yr old and 15 yr old girls now are just horrible to one another-it has been going on too long and i am just exhausted in what to do anymore. my 15 yr old i had leave our home (2months ago) due to her behaviorial issues and disrespect for myself, my home and especially her brother and sister. in the past 1 1/2 years she has gotten into a ton of trouble, alcohol, tried one narcotic, sexual encounters begenning at the age of 13, attitude, disrespect, and the last resort was stealing from a local store. a month after her being grounded, i had her stay with her father.her fathers home and mine are very close in distance, so doing favors.. etc. is not a problem. we have parented wonderfully together for the past 2 years now and try to keep discipline the same between the homes.i really do not know what to do anymore.. i feel i have given her every ounce of energy i have and there is nothing more to give. i have shown her great support during all of this, do not down talk her father, love and affection is always present and i feel as if all she has done is taken advantage of me and she could care less about anything.if you could please give me some advice as i feel like i have failed and i know that i haven't!thank you!!!!!!!!!!!! maria
169,i have been diagnosed with 1st degree av block and my heart is not filling up with blood fast enough.(which is why i guess, i get light headed and dizzy when i do any kind of assertion or anything)     i am 33 year old female. very healthy, i do not drink, smoke, very rarely drink caffeine.    i always stay fatigued and very tired, but am a mother of 3 and work 40-50 hours a week.    my mother had a heart attack at 58 and survived.    she had a 99 % blockage in an artery and now has a stint.    when i was pregnant with my 4 year old.    my mitral valve was not closing in my heart.    i have had an echo done about 2 years ago and it showed my mitral valve to be closing.    any time i assert my self, (cleaning , sweeping, walking too fast for about 50 foot steps,) i get lite headed, dizzy and short of breath.    i have to sit down so i don't pass out.    we found this av block a week and a half ago and am running blood work, a full work up.    can i go like this for ever or will i need a pacemaker?    can medicine fix this or any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.    also, do you think their could be some damage to my mitral valve from my pregnancy?    i do even have some sharp piercing pains periodicaly,, racing heart beat, pounding heart beat, even some flutters or quivers and sometimes it feels like a worm is crawling through???         thanks    jana........

171,first time posting but i've been lurking for months. read a topic today encouraging us (me) who have been behind the curtain to come out. here i am!i've been abusing oxycodone for a little over 2 years. started as a weekend thing, and as you can guess, turned into a daily thing. many things have brought me to this point, but i'm ready to just stop. been using 60-160 mg daily. just depended on $$ and time.i've tried to stop many times, but only half hearted about it. now that i'm posting, i personally know i'm ready to move on with my life!right now, just looking for encouragement!thank you
172,i had the contraceptove implant put in 2 weeks ago today, 3 days before my expected period. i had it inserted because i wasn't getting along with the contraceptive pill as i fell pregnant and miscarried and it made me extremely ill. however, i'm finding that the contraceptive implant is near enough having the same effects on me that the contraceptive pill had done.i was pre-warned that i had to wait at least 7 days for it to be effective. i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the 6th/7th day, and several times after that. i'm not questioning pregnancy, but the side effects are atrocious.my periods have stopped, but the nausea, lower abdominal cramping and headaches have all returned just like i experienced with the contraceptive pill.are the side effects supposed to be this bad? the cramping is absolute agony, even brought me to tears a few times.should i just stick with it, or have it removed?any advice helps!thank you!
173,hi therecan anybody put my mind at rest as to why i experience an increased heart rate when i have my daily bowel movements?    i'm not sure whether it's become a learned behaviour from my anxiety or if it's medical/bacteria related?i have gad and have had for about 5/6 years. but this symptom has been occurring only for a few months or so.it builds up and once i have finished with my bm my heart rate slows and i feel better.    it's very strange.    i do have heart neurosis along with my gad and when this is happening i check my pulse which is a regular (bad) habit for me.i do hope somebody out there who 'knows' facts can help.thank you in advance :)

176,i had a bulge on my penis this morning when i woke up. its looked very similar to mosquito bites. one was on the end of my penis and the other was visible on the shaft when i retracted my foreskin. since i was very worried it might be some sort of std i went to the urologists, but by the time i went there they had dissappeared (this was in the space of 8 or so hours. he said it was probably nothing, and that i should go.i argued because he keps ignoring my concerns, and i told it could be down to me having unprotected sex with 2 girls recently. 1 is a girl i know very well. we agreed to have unprotected sex with each other frequently. i am sure she doesnt sleep with anyone without protection except me. anyway i broke our agreement and slept with anotehr girl on a 1 night stand about 4 days ago. when the lump happened i had been sleeping with my regular girl that night. i explained this to the doctor and he said we should do blood test for vld and gonerrahea.right now im really confused what i should do, and i really dont trust my doctor at all well so dont know where to get decent advice from. please help

184,i did the quad test at 16.1w according to lmp, and my result came back with a 1:227 risk for down's. the mom values for afp was 0.53 (17.8 ng/ml), ue3 was 0.79 ( 2.16 ng/ml), hcg was 0.82 ( 21.4 iu/ml), inhibina was 2.26 ( 427.0 pg/ml). my age at term would be about 31 years.i repeated the triple screen at 17.4 weeks according to lmp (though u/s that day gave a ga of 18w2d), and this time my risk was calculated to be 1:8000. the mom values for    afp was 0.48 (27.5 ng/ml), ue3 was 4.13 (5.6 ng/ml), and hcg was 0.94 (23.2 iu/ml). note that this was done in a different lab.i would like to add that i had also done a first trimester nt plus pappa blood screen, which gave me a down's risk of < 1:5000. the mom for nt was 0.8, and the pappa was 1.73.additionally my level ii u/s had no markers and everything looked absolutely normal. my question is based on the way my ue3 changed between the 2 maternal serum tests, i think the risk changed significantly. does this change in ue3 seem like what would be expected at that stage in pregnancy? how much should i worry about this first multiple marker result though it seems like a false positive?i declined the amnio but now am going back and forth wondering if that was the right decision. i am looking for someone to look at my numbers closely, and see if they seem possible for an unaffected pregnancy. just to add, i am carrying a female fetus if that adds any more information and my racial origin is asian.i really look forward to an answer from one of the doctors since i think i am running out of time for an amnio.thanks!
185,first time 3months ago, i feel dizziness...after some days, when i go to work after having enough sleep, i feel very sleepy and fatigue at work....i think this is becauseof lack of sleep before it happens, i used to sleep only 4-5 hrs everyday. when i get enough sleeep, i always feel sleepy at work, i also feel mentally tired, i could not use my mind on creative activities, i feel like i am mentally tired. one day, when i was at work,i feel dizziness and after that i feel headache after work at night i went home, take shower and go to sleeep, next morning i feeel sleeepy and tired at work eventhough i had enough sleep.. i also feels like vomitting...and now i feel    light headedness at left part of head, unusual feeling at head, not able to concentrate, feels like something happening in the brain, dreaming every night left part of neck becomes stiff sometimes and when moving neck, it pains, ad also the unusual pain in the left pain like stretching in the left head..do i have any solutions for that?

191,in april of 97', i had a 360 fusion with bone plugs, graft, hardware.    i never got better, just got way worse.    taking alot of narcotics that frankly don't work anymore.    i have 4 epidurals annually, that help.screws at l34 look good, 2/3rds into vertabrae.    screws at l45 look the same.    screws @ s1extend beyond the anterior cortex or the s1 vertebral body and are next to the expected location of the sacral plexus.    they are out approx. 2 mm.    i was told this is one way to do this procedure.    i can't imagine that their are different ways to do a surgery this complex.i am in misery 24/7.    i am not over weight, i take good care of myself.    i know where the pain generator starts, and i believe the tips of the scres at s1 are a problem.question:    15 years post of should i have the hardware removed?
192,hello! i am currently going thru a detox of paxil, hydros, nicotine, and while i was at it i stopped the marijuana.i am a wreck!it's been about 10-13 days i've stopped the paxil - i did so with the help of my doc from 40mg gradually down to 10. i am completely off the med currently. i started taking it approx 5 years agoit's been about 3-4 days since i've stopped the hydros. i started those about the same time as the paxil. problem being off these is i need them for pain. there have been many times i was able to stop and i only take them when i need to, but i hate to be taking anything!and it's been the same 3-4 days since i've stopped the nicotine and the marijuana.you can imagine why i'm a wreck. i'm a mom to 3 very young kids and i'm doing everything i can to be clean.my real questions are this:1. how do i completely stop the narcotic pain meds if i actually have severe pain i need them for?2. how long is this horrible detox from paxil gonna take? i have had some huge sensory problems as well as the regular anxiety and such.3. why isn't there an easier way?!!!?!!!!that last one is rhetorical :-).thank you in advance!
193,i have had 2 upper endoscopys and the first showed stomach ulcers and chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia.    the second showed chronic gastritis.    i am having stomach pains, gnawing, in my upper abdomen that wake me up at night.    these went away from the end of march to the end of may but are back again.    h pylori was negative.    ultrasound of gallbladder was negative.    acid levels in stomach came back normal.    any thoughts on what this could be?
194,i) am 66 and have had these symptoms for a long time. it happens about once every couple of months and sometimes more. i get severe cramping and break out in a dripping sweat and almost faint to where i have tolay on the bathroom floor. after i finally get rid of the stool i am better but feel chilled and weak most of the night.i have had a colonoscopy and they said it is irritable bowel syndrome it seems quite intense and scary and i justfeel like their is something else going on. i do notice it seems to happen more with a lot of sweets/sugar intake.is their a doctor out there that knows what this is? i have been tested for chron's and cyliac(sp?) and i don't havethat.thank you

196,hi. i made the (drunken) mistake of having unprotected sex with a female i met last night. less than 24 hours later i have developed a slight burning sensationat the tip of my penis. it does not hurt or burn when i urinate. i also seem to have a fever and vomitted once (this evening, so obviously not from being hungover). how long does it take for symptoms for an std to show up? as i figure, its probably a urinary tract infection from when we attemped to have anal sex.
197,my daughter was born with ktw.    she was seen in the genetics clinic at the children's hospital.    she has a large hemangioma that covers most of her back, part of her right arm/hand, the right side of her abdoman and some small spots on her left buttock/upper thigh.    my concern is about her foot and left ring finger.    her left foot is 1 1/2 cm bigger than her right and her second toe is much longer on that foot as well.    her ring finger on her left hand is bigger than the rest of her fingers.    i am concerned that they will continue to grow at an abnormal rate and that could present problems when she learns to walk.    she is going to be evaluated for ot--when she was born her hands were fisted and the thumb was over the middle finger and held them down and it is difficult for her to extend them.    any information you can give me would be appreicated.    the dr. in the genetics clinic is just monitoring her at this point and she will go back in six months.
198,i''ve had a recurrent urinary tract infection since may and none of the 4 antibiotics i've taken seemed to have completely kicked the infection. although i have lingering flank/back/abdominal/pelvic pain, frequent low-grade fever, very little appetite and constant fatigue, my recent urine labs have been negative---except for 1,000-10,000 cfu/ml of coalgulase negative staphylococcus which my ob/gyn says is a contaminant or colonizer and not the cause of my infection. could she be wrong? could my uti be caused by a staph infection? if so, what would be the appropriate treatment? any suggestions for how i should proceed?charlotte
199,my boyfriend and i had done std's exams and all came out negative except hsv ii ig g. mine came out as 0.96 ( equivocal) and my boyfriend's result was 1.16.    he hasn't had any symptoms and only had one sexual partner previously ( 2 years ago).    what is the probability that we might have herpes ii???    how accurate and precised is this test??    could this results be false positives??? how often false positives occur?? what should we do??

203,hi forum friends,hope everyone had a good halloween.    we got alot of kids this year.    of course i was going to clean a little in preparation for going away next week.    we have a cat sitter coming in and my house is just embarrasing...more so than usual because i have no energy to even straighten up.    i never had energy for cleaning but it's even worse now.anyway...my question is about itching and dysautonomia.    i have allergies that got diagnosed...wow, almost 10 years ago when i was getting hives all over my body.    i came up positive for mold, dust, wheat, eggs grasses, and cats.    the food allergies have to be mild because besides not being able to get flu shots (they are grown in eggs and everytime i've gotten one, i had a reaction), i can eat wheat and eggs.    i take allegra and clarinex daily and they control the other ones...including cat!    we have three :)    anyway...i have been uncontrollably itching around my neck and upper back as well as lower arms over the past month or so.    it's entirely possible it's the change of season but it's never been this bad.    i've worn the same gold necklace for 28 years and i can't believe all of a sudden i could be allergic to gold.    i took it off to see if it helped and so far nothing.    i hate having it off...it has my cross on it and i just hate not having it on!so my question is this...i have read snippets here and there about antihistimines being helpful for us.    what's the reason for that?    do you think the dysautonomia has anything to do with the itching?    thanks in advance :)going for a holter monitor tomorrow...don't think it's gonna show anything.    i don't believe i have any arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat with the ncs but we'll see!stephanie
204,i am 40 year old male who is frequently peeing ( at least 3-4 times an hour) and have frequently felt as if i have to go again after peeing ( although a few drops only come out). i have went to my doctors who initally gave me antibiotics for a uti ( although after a second course he stopped them saying he didn't think it was a uti). i have had all the tests done e.g. tests looking at bacteria in urine, sugar in urine, blood in urine, psa test, full blood tests which all have came back normal. i also had an abdominal ultrasound done which showed my prostrate and kidneys to be fine - although there seemed to a fair amount of urine left in my bladder after voiding ( don't know the amount).    also my symptoms come and go e.g. they may be worse or more acute for a while - then be not so bad or sightly diminshed for a few days and then come back. i'm usually not so bad at night - although early morning ( e.g. from about 6.ooam on ) i might have the feeling to go every hour. again sometimes if i'm very occupied ( and not thinking about the peeing) i won't go as much - although this doesn't always work. i have also been suffering from a poorer strength of ejacution and my urine flow is generally weak (er) - and i still feel as if i have to go after voiding. there is no straining to start - but dribbling afterwards happens. could someone help please? i'm a bit worried it could be cancer - i also have an apointment with a urologist in six weeks.

206,hello to all,my mother had a hysterectomy procedure done at the northwick park hospital in london on 1 june 2007 under the care of miss j. pitkin.soon after the opperation, she noticed that she could not lift her left foot off the bed. she also could not move her foot upwards when sitting on a chair and could not stand of walk. sensation on the left thigh, leg and foot was not same as the right. she kept falling down in the hospitals and nurses and junior doctors kept saying that it was either sciatica or a compressed nerve, but it will go away on its own. but it cannot be sciatica, becuase she has never had it on the right leg, and she does not have any pain.we asked on seeing miss pitkin or her registrar who could say what had caused this problem, but no matter how much we insisted, we saw neither of them.finally, she was discharged on 5 june, and at home she is a mess both physically and mentally, and so far there is no improvement.meanwhile, no specialist has come to see her, and although i put in an informal complaint, we still have not seen miss pitkin to get an explaination.my mother has been the patient of miss pitkin, and she does not know what she looks like. she has never seen her, not prior to the operation and not after this problem.i would be grateful for any information on this subject. what could have caused this, and how can it be treated, if at all it is treatable.
207,if i test positive for this can it be cured.. i have had my blood work done and everything is fine my alt is 14.. i am showing very low levels, if i get the shots will it go away in time,or can my body get rid of it on it's own..
208,hi everyone! my baby girl is 2 weeks old on friday and we are exclusively breastfeeding/pumping. right out of the hospital i could produce 4 oz per 2-3 hours which i hear is a miracle for new moms. we tried breastfeeding but the last day at the hospital she got lazy and stopped trying to latch which led to her sleeping all day and not feeding so i started to pump there. (manual medela) i waited 4-5 days to buy a double breast pump incase she decided to try breast feeding again and ended up with a lansinoh affinity double pump. ive been storing breast milk for her pretty well. i just basically pumped whenever i felt full and started keeping track of how much she ate vs how much i pump. when i finally got to counting and pumping on a schedule i noticed that my supply stayed the same and didnt increase. so what is the point of pumping 8 times a day if im getting the same amount pumping 6x? ive added in pumps in the middle of the night but its just stressful having to get up especially if shes actually sleeping 5 hours. and im not pumping more than 3-4 oz at that time anyways. should i continue to try to pump 8times a day including the night pump? or should i just relax and pump the way i did when i first got home, getting the same amount of milk?she eats anywhere from 19-22 oz a day and i pump 30-34oz
209,just wondering, i am thinking about stopping the pill and talking to my doctor about the paraguard i.u.d.    anyone no anything about it?    from what i have read it is as effective and it as no hormones.
210,i am a 24 year old who is suffering from vomiting which started a month ago and it's not relieve by antibiotics,antiacids or antiemetics as prescribed by the pharmacists.i'm not anorexic nor a bulimic.i went to the doctors and they didn't find anything.they just have my u/a test and it's normal according to the result.they palpate my stomach and abdomen and said it may be infection,gastroenteritis or a suspected ap but they didn't prescribed me any drugs.i requested for a blood test but my doctor said there's no need to have one.i'm still taking the antacids to somehow relieve the acid in my stomach but i'm still vomiting after i eat small or large meals...please i need your health advice if there is anything i could do.i will see my doctor again but not until next week.i'm also drinking diarolyte to replace my electrolytes.i just want to have an idea of what is really causing my vomiting.please help me find the answer to this for i'm already very concern about it..thank you very much.hope to hear from you soon..
211,is fingering considered a safe sexual activity if my partners hands are washed well and sanitized sometimes before it occurs? is there any way it can get you pregnant? if so how? is it if the person has fresh semen on their hands? ,    also i've been getting yellow slightly smelly discharge over the last 2 days after he has fingered me fully, do i have a yeast infection because when it happens it goes onot my underwear and irritates my vagina. it may be yellow due to sitting there and the air though, well thats what ive heard is that true?
212,i am a female and was diagnosed with mollscum last spring. i had one outbreak and got that burned off. have been molluscum free for several months. recently had a new outbreak of 2 bumps. rather than squeeze them and risk spreading it, i am using benzoyl peroxide 10% and within a few days it already seems better. if the bumps disappear completely, can i resume sexual activity? also, is it necessary to wash underwear in hot water? i can only wash it in cold water and air dry it b/c i don't have hot water at the moment, nor do i have a dryer.this discussion is related tomolluscom contagiosum.
213,two days ago, i developed this terribly itchy rash on my left forearm, then the next day, on the other. it will get really red, and nothing i tried seemed to work ( it comes and goes every few hours). i have never had this kind of rash before and i am very puzzled by it. any input would be greatly appreciated.
214,well, i did it!    had my last injection last saturday and my last ribavirin on thursday.    i'm 1b and did the whole 48 weeks.    it wasn't easy sometimes, but you keep going.    i was undetectable at six months, so i'm optimistic.    i'll get the verdict in a couple of weeks.    now i just need to put on some weight and get rid of my itchy skin.    my daughter calls me bony man.    so, hang in there everybody.
215,i'm a 14 year old female lately i have been feeling short of breath get really sweaty and sometimes get pains in my stomach. i went to the doctor to get it checked out but they said it was nothing wrong!i am very active in sports!please help!
216,hello.    my son is 2 1/2 years old and is extremely hyperactive.    from the moment he wakes up in the morning until he goes to bed at night he is on the go as my husband and i call it.    he has pretty much been like this since he was able to walk.    he doesn't listen when being told to do things, he dosesn't respond to time out or any sort of discipline.    i thought that it was just a 2 year old thing or even a boy thing, but now it seems to be interfering in other things.    i am a stay-at-home-mom so i am always with him.    we have what i call an arts and crafts time every morning after breakfast... during this time we color, draw pictures, make signs for daddy, ect.    during this time he throws the crayons across the room, ripes the paper up, ect.    i can not get him to concentrate at all.    then during the afternoons if its nice outside we will go to the park or take a walk.    this is another ordel.    he doesn't socialize well with the other children, he is yelling and trying to push them over.    i feel like i am constantly apoligizing to the other mothers for his behavior.    on days when it isn't nice outside, i put in a movie for him and he can't even sit still for 5 mins during it.    he is up and down off of the couch, picking up his toys and throwing them around the room, running up and down the stairs.    i put him it time out when things get really out of control for 2 1/2 mins, then explain to him what he did and that that type of behavior is unexceptable and he will go right back to doing it.    he goes back into time out again and again and again with the same results everytime.    now within the last week he is refusing to eat.    he will eat a little bit and then starting throwing the food off of his plate, turning his cup over to spill his milk on the floor, hitting whoever is sitting next to him.    i have repeatedly took him out of his chair and into time out and again nothing works.    i am at my wits end.    his doctor says that he is definintely showing signs of adhd and probably needs to be on medication.    i do not want him on medication!! i am scared and tired and not sure what to do.    is there a natural way to make this better??    i tried adjusting his diet.    he only drinks milk and water.     i make him healthy foods for all of this meals - not that he really eats them anymore.    he doesn't eat sugary snacks.    any advice would be soooo helpful.
217,ok not sure if this is revelat. i have axonel pheriphral neuropathy, lwr back problems. i take meds... pain meds help my legs and back... but it seems when i run out all i can do is masterbate. i cant sleep ill do it with orgasism 100+ (no exaggeration) till like 5 am. it can take between 2-5min from beginning to orgasm. im very ocd about it.the major problem i rip myself up despite cutting of nail, do it til im bloody and injured and still cant stop. it even hurts badly but i cant do anything    to stop myself. please help.
218,have been told i have severe nerve damage to my left hand, have not been told how i aquired it. my problem began after i had a rotor cup repair to rt. shoulder. several weeks later noticed my left hand was having some sort of problem. asked about it and was told it was coming from my neck. three months later had no use of my left hand. received an injection in back of neck and now have permenate tingling in hand,will it be possible to regain use of my left hand? i am left handed.this discussion is related toloss of muscle mass and pain in hands and arms.
219,i have just recently met this guy and we are becoming friends and all that and i want to tell him i have bipolar but    i don't know how he will react. but if i don't tell him its like i'm keeping secrets from him and i don't like doing that. what if he doesn't like me after i tell him or he treats me different? i don't have much time with him on my own and my other mates already know and were telling me they were goner tell him because they think it would make him laugh, i know that sounds terrible ( they think that my behaviors are weird sometimes and i think they think bipolar is a joke) :(. my other friends only know because my mum told them and i got so mad at her for that. i want this friend to know because he is going through some stuff of his own and i want him to know that i will listen and not judge him if he is brave enough to talk to me. do i just blurt it out in front of him and explain later? or not tell him?how do you tell your friends about your bipolar? do they normally react ok?cheers

225,hi, this is a great site & i hope that someone can help me here. it is a long story and i will try to put it in a chronological order. i am a 28 year old male.on18th jan'10 i came across a sex worker and indulged in oral and vaginal sex. the oral sex was unprotected though for vaginal sex i had a condom on. the oral sex of blowjob lasted for 4-5 minutes and vaginal sex was only for couple of minutes. after couple of days of the encounter, 22st jan'10    i started feeling some tingling in my genital area. although worried i left it and after a period of 10 days or so the tingling went away itself.on 22nd feb'10 i again started feeling the similar irritation & tingling around my penis coupled by frequent urge to urinate, i was having itching all over my body with red scars. i went to a gp next day who diagnosed for scabies and also gave me zithromax of 250mg to be taken 4 at a time at one go. for scabies i was given derbac m solution. i was tested for a possible uti, syphills and normal blood infection but all came negative i took the dosage as prescribed but the tingling sensation around my penis continued to exist though scabies went away.on 7th march'10 i got tested for gonorrhea & chlamydia    through a swab test and the result was also negative. on 26th april' 10 that is 97 days post the encounter i was tested for hiv which came out to be negative. in all the cases the report was given in 4-5 days. i have not experienced discharge or pain in penis though tingling sensation is there.the time went on however all of a sudden recently i again started feeling a similar ting around the tip of my penis followed by an increased frequency to urinate & dribbling. also i feel dull pain around my shoulders, neck, forearms, thighs & groin. this is a mild pain and not something that i am unable to bear. apart from this i also feel mild headache & bouts of stomach pain. the penis gets more uncomfortable when i am sitting.i have not seen any blisters or lesions around the genital area.    since 18th jan i have not indulged in any form of sexual activity and as a matter of fact that was my first ever intercourse in all these years of my life.i am getting really worried what this whole episode is all about. i have only seen one gp and considering to probably look out for a urologist. at this point of time i am not sure if this is an std like hiv, herpes, hpv or uti, ngu, proststitis.the recent developments of pain and penis tingling is forcing me to think its hiv!also, with regards to above i have following questions.1) what are the chances of hiv not showing up even after 97 days?2) what these symptoms sound like, in particular pain around neck, stomach & headache?3) is prostatitis similar to some form of std's or hiv?4) what are my options hereon? is it herpes?kindly help me.i originally posted this question in std forum but was suggested to re post in hiv forum.

231,i found this by accident surfing the net. it just really had a powerful affect on me and would love to share it. it's called the four agreements.1. be impeccable with your word:speak with integrity. say only what you mean. avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.2. don't take anything personally:nothing others do is because of you. what others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. when you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.3. don't make assumptions:find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. with just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.4. always do your best:your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.hope you all enjoy this. i have actually have it hanging in my home office and took to my work office today. thank you for taking the time to read.jean
232,need to chat with someone else that suffers this horrible affliction. i also suffer from major depressive disorder along with anxiety and panic attacks. seems to be getting worse since menopause. has occurred. have started my own groupwww.medhelp.org/groups/major_depressive_disorder_anxiety. please feel free to join me in my group as well
233,the results are in and the dr. has ordered an thyroid uptake.    there is one nodule that is 2.8x1.8x1.5.    they tell me if the scan comes back normal that they will not do anything with the nodule - no meds either.    waht are your thoughts?
234,i was recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. subclinical hypothyroidism to be exact.    i have a few questions that i hope you guys can answer.    i've read a really long thread that i found my the search engine that convinced me to sign up.    you guys seem very informative.    hope you can help me.they want to put me on levothyroxine which i'm against.    i am a believer in natural stuff so i mentioned i take armour.    they told me to think about it.    they told me all the stuff i've read about.    that it's unrealiable.    that you get too much etc.    i'm suppose to be getting another thyroid test hopefully soon (to see if it's changed) and then they are going to determine a course of action.    i told them that i went on a strict diet in 2005.    that i started drinking soy milk and lots of soy related products.    my hair started looking dull in march of 06.    i got sick in april with a fever and my hair started falling out like crazy.once i started eating meat and protein again, the hair stopped falling out (8 months later) but hasn't full recovered.    i'm convinced the soy milk is what caused the thyroid issue as no one in my family has these health issues.    i developed sweating issues and once off the soy milk this past september, their nearly non existant.    i don't know if the continued sweating (hardly bad) is from the thyroid or if its from certain food that has soy in it.    it's hard to avoid.    i try to eat organic and watch what i eat.everyone in my family has a full head of my hair.    they checked my testosterone and since it's normal, they now think the hair loss is because of the thyroid.    can't these doctors make up their mind?    in the beginning he told me that his boss recommends armour but he doesn't.    now a couple months later he's telling that his boss doesn't.    what's going on here?    is he that desperate to get me on a synthetic drug?    he wants me to think about levothyroxine.i've also read that in some cases, the subclinical kind can go away on it's own.    i'm thinking that being off the soy milk will definately help it but i've read that it can take 3 months to get the toxicity of the soy out of my system.    maybe even longer depending on how long i took it for.    i'm so desperate to get things moving here.    i've been a bug on the wall for 3 years.    tired, exhausted, insomnia, sweating issues, tremors, heart palps. it's crazy stuff.i'm very confused about the dosage talk about these pills.    i've read that it's better to split the pill in half and take half in the morning and half around supper.    i have a high tsh (7.02) but i believe my t3 and t4 are normal.    i would like to know how all this works.    what exactly has to be done to make the tsh go down?    what do i need to watch out for?    how long does it take to work?    anything else you think i should would be appriciated.thankssean
235,i had my gallbladder removed end of nov 08, by laparoscopy. 14 weeks later, my right ribcage still aches if i sit too long or work too hard, and the most disturbing part is that other abdominal muscles tend to sprain easily, maybe even tear. i had a golfball size swelling on the left side below my ribcage after skiing (i didn't fall or do anything involving strain). i asked my surgeon, and she said couldn't be related to surgery -- you've had enough time to heal. i think it is related. i've never had abdominal muscle problems of any kind ever. i would like to hear some comments from others...did you have discomfort past six weeks (14 weeks in my case), and eventually, did it go away? how do you gauge how much exercise you should do when muscles keep spraining or tearing? i'm a little surprised and concerned.
236,i am on 50 mg zoloft and 2.5 mg abilify for obsessive-compulsive disorder.    i have been on these medications for 5 years.    i have gained about 20 pounds since the start of taking them.    i am looking for another medication to replace abilify.    can you recommend anything in it's place?    i have tried stopping abilify, under my doctor's supervision, but my anxiety is too high to stop completely.    i am very unhappy with the weight gain.    please let me know what my alternatives are.
237,hi, i have been on levothyroxine since july 2011, 50 mcg daily, also 5mg quinapril daily since then. i was under the impression that synthroid improves cholesterol levels. my doctor told me. he also recommended fish two or three times a week, and lamb otherwise. i eat red meat once or twice a week and salmon three times.physically, you would not think i need to be on these meds. i am thin and athletic, a swimmer's body. i work out six days a week.my total cholesterol level one year ago before these meds was 191. my tsh increased from 4.5 to 7.75 and that is when i was put on the meds. my bp spiked at one point due to my panic attack of a diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease, and then i was put on quinapril. months since, i feel great. joint pain about gone, much improved digestion. tsh measured 1.83 in november. blood pressure under control. i am an avid fitness swimmer and swim seven or eight miles a week. i run too.my latest cholesterol level measures 235. my cardiologist endorses my swimming, did not prescribe meds, and only suggested doubling my supplement of red yeast rice, which i have done.i am bewildered. why is my cholesterol and ldl increasing? i try eating healthy. the only good thing i gave up was green tea, one because my seven cups a day ended up giving me kidney stones and two, because the flouride in it clashes with synthroid.comments please?
238,i have had discomfort in my right shoulder and the middle of my chest for several months. this has not been constant just every now and then. i seem to have more indigestion now. i had an ultrasound and it showed that everything was normal. i am going for a chest x-ray and a hida scan on friday. any suggestions?
239,hello,i was wondering if anyone has any advice or thoughts on my situation.    im 42 went in for my baseline and then a call back for a diagnostic mammogram. they have found two clusters of microcalcifications that have odd shapes...kinda grain of rice looking.    is that an indication that there is a malignancy.    i have a needle biopsy scheduled in a week and a half and im just wondering if there are any stats on percentage of malignancy with these kinds of microcalcifications. i guess i will know soon enough but the waiting is the hardest part.
240,hi, i've posted in the past and you have all been very helpful.    today i was diagnosed with oc stage iii.    i'd love to hear some positive stories of people fighting this.
241,i have recently been diagnosed with a abnormal breast lump.    i've had an ultrasound already, and am supposed to get a mammogram next.    the doctor said that the i can either get a biopsy, or have the lump/tumor removed altogether in surgery.    he said that the needle that they would use for the biopsy would be very large in order to get enough tissue to examine, and that it would be extremely painful.    however, i don't know if immediately going into surgery is a good option either.    i received a birad 4a result after the ultrasound.    i am wondering if anyone can help me decide which option would be better for me.    a painful biopsy, or having the entire lump removed to be tested?
242,i am 30 years old and have been on suboxone for 7 years! the funny thing is, i wasn't even a heavy user when i was prescribed this medication. i wasn't even in withdrawal. anyways, i am trying to quit after tapering to approx. 1mg a day. i am not even at the 48 hour mark and i am doing okay but feeling like its going to get bad. please help.
243,i'm 35, will get married but unfortunately, by surgery 3 weeks ago, i had my both ovaries, tube, uterus & omentum removed since a cyst on my ovary was malignant. so having baby is impossible. i'm diagnozed ova ca stage 1c with clear cell adenocarcinoma. my doctor will get me 3 cycles chemo by platinum based drug. i heard that clear cell is resistant to platinum based chemo drug (carbo,cisplatin, cyclophospomide, doxorubicin, 5fu, paclitaxel,taxol, etc) & platinum based causes recurrence. and some platinum would increase ca-125. i also heard that irinotecan plus mitomycin c is more effective to kill clear cancer cell. i'm blind about this cause in my country, doctor usually is not open to give more information. anyone know about this issue? and how to avoid recurrence? how i increase my red & white blood cell before chemo? thanks all, god bless u
244,i have been diagnosed with hep b ab hep b core hep be. i read that a  positive test for core antibody in the absence of other antibodies against hbv therefore calls for a test specific to hepatitis c as well as additional tests for hepatitis b.q: specific to hepatitis c? is it to see if i have been a chronic carrier of hepatitis c? because i know about 25 to 50 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis c will have a positive hepatis b core antibody test.i also read that the hbeag is an antigen that stimulates an antibody (e antibody) that is diagnostically important because it reflects active replication of the virus. a positive test for the hbe antigen indicates that the virus is continuing to reproduce itself, while presence of the antibody indicates that it is not.q: by taking medications or maybe the vaccination for hepatitis b, do you think it can stop the replication of this virus? i am 19 now, is it too late to take the vaccination?how long do i have to take medication for this? lifetime? or only if by miracle it goes away?even if it does go away, do i still have to take medication for that?is it safe to get married and have kids? because the doctor told me i could not kiss anyone or even put my toothbrush near anybody else's toothbrush. no, i'm not sexually active, at leat for 2 yrs going on 3 nowis there a way to find out how i attracted this virus or how long i've had it?

247,just wondering why i dont see anyone talking about ccsvi...i live in barrie,ontario,canada and this treatment has been making news every day...there are quite a few doctors behind it in barrie fighting the government(who put a stop to it pending further evidence)...a few ms patients have been treated in barrie before the stoppage and are doing great...i hope they resume testing soon...i'd hate to think that the 64 billion the drug companys receive in canada alone for ms meds have that much pull in the government that ms patients have to suffer if there is a possible cureregardsjames
248,just want to know my hubby is a genotype 1a his viral load is 2 million (it was at half million jumped to 2 million in about 7 weeks) had biopsy 2 weeks ago got results today he has cirrhosis - stage 4. he had an mri in november they said no cirrhosis but now he is stage 4? is it that they could not tell with the mri or is it possible for things to get this bad this quick? things just seem to be moving in slow motion for us. he was diagnosed in july, it took us until late sept to get in with a specialist and after 2 appts with her she sent us to another dr which we could not get in to see until the middle of november and tried twice for the biopsy it kept getting postponed by the hospital until 2 weeks ago now i think everything is done and he is supposed to start treatment i guess next week after the dr appt. but am curious would anyone treat the hep c with cirrhosis stage 4. isn't stage 4 the worst? just wondering what your opinions are because we really aren't sure what to do.
249,hello everyone!    i am having a sharp pain on my lower left side.    it comes and goes, but it is pretty strong.    any ideas?    i called the doctor and we wants me to come in.    i am 11w 1d and have had many ultra sounds, so i know its not eptopic.    it is probably just ligiment pain, but i was worried enough to call.    i was suppose to see the doctor on wednesday for my 4 weeks check up, so i am just going a couple of days early.    do you think they will be able to hear the heartbeat with the doppler today??

255,hi,i'm 24 years of age, and for the past week i've been having back pains, mostly in my shoulders, middle of my back and lower back. last night, after eating dinner (spaghetti) i had a really strange feeling in my stomach. i've always had a weak stomach, i get a lot of stomach aches but this feeling was different, it was tight, and heavy and ran across my upper abdomen. i could    barely sleep @ night because when i laid down on my stomach it was so painful and i felt a bit nauseous. i went to the er this morning and found out i had a gallstone. until i found out that i had a gallstone, the pain was always in my left side, but now since i found out about the gallstone i get pain in my right and left.the ultrasound was clear on my left side. both my kidneys and stuff are clear, and there isn't any inflammation in my abdomen, it's just that one gallstone. it's starting to give me problems now, the right side hurts, i have back pain, right under my shoulder blades, dead smack in the middle and my lower lower back hurts, towards my tail bone i guess.. and not to mention i still get pains in the left side, plus abdominal discomfort. the dr gave me meds for the abdominal discomfort but its so damn uncomfortable i can barely eat anything. i'm afraid to eat anything!i have no idea why my left side hurts.. could it be the pain from the right just spreading across to the left? and should i just get my gallstone out? the thing is, i'm just a bit hesitant because i'm living overseas so i don't feel too comfortable, i mean, even the dr said i should get it in america

258,http://scoop.today.com/_news/2011/09/22/7898154-rebooted-scarface-in-the-worksa new version of the iconic film scarface is in the works, according to a deadline hollywood report. universal studios is behind the project, and it's still in the very early stages -- studio heads are currently meeting with writers to see who will pen the film.one important thing to note: this is not intended to be a typical remake or a sequel. instead, the updated scarface will include common elements of the first two films: an outsider, an immigrant, (who) barges his way into the criminal establishment in pursuit of a twisted version of the american dream, becoming a kingpin through a campaign of ruthlessness and violent ambition.in the very first iteration of the film in 1932, the tony character was an italian who took over chicago; when al pacino helmed the role, he was a cuban in the cocaine trade in miami. there's no word yet on what the studio has its eye on for the updated version.but here's the real question: should there even be an updated version, or should we let a good thing stand as is? for the record, lots of people were unhappy with the thought of brian depalma doing his version in 1983, and look how that turned out. weigh in below, readers.

271,my daughter was diagnosed to have idiopathic precocious puberty, based on 'advanced' bone maturation (given that blood tests and mri results are normal), and other physical signs such as growth spurt and breast budding, and her pedia endocrinologist is recommending a monthly vaccine of    leuprolide until age 8.    my daughter's hand x-ray shows that at her age of 5 years and 5 months, her bone age corresponds to that of a 6 years and 10 month old female.    is this classified as advanced bone maturation?i also read from different artilces online that not all precocious puberty cases should be treated.    with the symptoms and lab results described above, should this type of precocious puberty be treated with the said shots?    i am not confident about the doctor's recommendation.    maybe you have insights on other options or recommendations.    thanks!

273,i am in florida in and around daytona beach..can anyone recommend a doctor around the area that does not believe in rai..out of all of the articles i have read no medicine including snythroid after rai is healthy. fda info on synthroid         http://www.thyroid-info.com/articles/fdasynthroidletter.pdfi think its a crime that doctors are pushing    for rai !    is there a law stating how long you can take the pills for hyperthyroid?? the doctors don't care but i do and no one is going to force anything on me. any info on any doctors in florida even family physicians that will try anything other then rai would be very helpful.if a doctor refuses    to consider medicine with only 1 option ...rai..if anything happens to you i would think that you could sue rightly because you are being forced into what they want?

276,i am a somewhat recent step mom of two daughters (7 and 9) and a son (10).    the children live with their father and i and visit their mother every other weekend.    up until now, the visits have been for 6-8 hours during the day.    their mother has a history of mental instability, but has been stable for the past 6 months or so.    she wants to keep the children overnight, but lives in a small apartment and stated that the girls would sleep in the same (double) bed as she does and son would sleep on an air bed in the same room.    my instincts tell me that this is a bad idea, but i don't want to be unreasonable if there is nothing for me to fear.    can you tell me what negative impact this might have on the children (the girls especially)?
277,my two and a half year old has dark discolored patches in the whites of both of her eyes.    she seems to have no trouble with her vision, although someone commented the other day that they thought she was moving her head to one side to look at something.    we will be scheduling an appointment to get her eyes checked, but the darkerpatches have been noticeable since birth. are they a sign of some sort of vitamin deficiency or other medical condition?? her pediatrician has never mentioned any concern over this, but now we're starting to worry that there could be some underlying condition that we're missing. any advice you can give would be appreciated. thank you
278,i am 51 years old and started taking 20mgs. of benicar for high blood pressue about 4 months ago.    about 6 weeks ago i first noticed the itching and bite like places on my buttocks.    i also notice that my feet (mostly left one) is swollen and very tender above the area of my toes.    i did not know if this was a delayed reaction to this medication or if the itching and foot problems were associated with some other thing medically going on right now.    also, i do not take any other meds and do not add salt or eat foods containing salt.    thanks for your input.
279,have hashimoto for over 7 years, and just got the diagnosis of diabetes two months ago. i had an ultrasound test last month and    my left kidney length is 13.7cm , right one is 13cm length. i am 172cm(5'7'') tall asian female. is it the normal size? i googled and found the normal size should be less than 12cm. but i had some urnine test and my doctor said the kidney function seems ok. since i had diabetes i feel nervous of my kidney function. do i need to see a nephrologist?
280,im 20 years old and ive been having recurring itchiness and swelling of my labia. i thought it was a result of sex, but recently my boyfriend has been away and im still experiencing discomfort. there are cuts between the labia minora and majora, but i dont know how theyre being caused. and my inner labia are really swollen and sensitive. ive been tested for all the stds including herpes and i dont have anything. ive been putting neosporin on, which helps a little. im wondering if anyone has any ideas about what might be causing the cuts or the itchiness and swelling...
281,i was recently in a car accident (12/24/2010), and in the incident i never actually hit my head on anything but there was a lot of force against my neck and spine. i hit a cememnt wall from behind so the force was like a hucking motion in my seat. i really only suffered neck pain and some other joint issues. then, two days later i had my first ever migraine with an aura and freaked out. i had the broken glass vision and the heat waves and the blind spots which passed followed by a massive headache. ever since then, i sometimes get headaches but haven't had an aura like that yet reoccur. the headaches will be on one side of the brain and i know most of it is stress because i've been overly anxious since the accident. since then, i've been also very observant of other things like floaters in my eyes and little white spots..like balls of light..pin dots really. i only see this in the sky or on white cars or my laptop's white screen but not in the dark or when i close my eyes. i pay a little too much attention to my floaters. i had my eyes dialated and inspected and was informed they were extremely healthy. i never went for a follow up or ct scan or anything from my main doctor. all my physical pain is gone..sometimes i get an upset stomach, mild headaches, etc..very tired.i've always had an anxiety issue. before the car wreck my anixety was not an issue, i'd dealt with it but since the wreck it's returned to the surface in a way and i cannot tell if i'm so anxious i'm playing too much into my vision. now my ears are rining and i feel a bit dizzy, but i've had tinnitus before and i don't get much sleep lately and i'm very stressed because of my anixety and mild depression. is it possible to1) have these pin dots of light without a headache, in bright light? or be sensitive to light without an actual migraine after a car accident?or2) through great anxiety and panic, see more pin dots of lightthese dots don't occur in the dark or anything and i'm not going blind or blurred vision so..they ruled out retinal detatchment. i had a load of xrays from the wreck and was deamed physically ok. can you be so anxious you really play too much into what is just normal? as for the floaters, i've only had one or two new ones...but they may have always been and i'm not just observing them since the aur of migrain scared the heck out of me literally.i am wondering if migraines can be really ongoing in the background from stress and slight post trauma, causing this pin dot sensation, etc..or if it's more logical to say this is my anxiety. i frequently have a fear of death and over analyze my bodily sensastions..and when i'm distracted enough i do not observe these pin dots of light at all...or even my floaters...i don't know.
282,i have had my gallbladder out for at least three years. i am having pain around the same location under right side ribs. the pain is not going away and i am not sure on what to do.

284,i have a 10 year old girl, doing quite well at school.her normal personality is quite outgoing, popular among friends at the point that i need some break from her plans to see friend on the daily basis :)she has always been strong minded and sometimes stubborn towards household rules, but recently has been concerning that she has been using more often 'bad language' in the family, quite unusual for her.also rebellious behavior and could not apologies for any of her behaviors.i am fully aware of    hormones play an important part on her age, still it worries me that she has started being distant from me and manipulative.any help?nina
285,i have posted many times before in the neurology area due to many issues that remain unresolved, however, i worried about als when i began having difficulty swallowing, worsening hoarseness that is almost now constant, pain in the back of my neck and difficulty breathing at times.     i was just released from the hospital for tests for ms and such, and when a endoc. consult came in, he felt an enlarged thyroid.    all blood and urine studies show no problem with function.my sister has no thyroid, and more importantly, my maternal grandmother had thyroid cancer.your thoughts and advice are appreciated.    i do not know the size of the growth.    it is on the underside of my gland. (end. consult seems not worried and can't get me in for awhile and also asked that i remind him of the hoarseness when i see him again in his office)!    (not going to happen)!
286,hi im 19 and i had sex with my boyfriend for the first time a week ago. the first time i didnt bleed but we didnt go at it that long. the second time i bled a little. the next time i bled some more and we tried again yesterday and there was light bleeding. we never go for more than 5 minutes because it still hurts. can anyone tell me why im still bleeding.
287,i was eating a dumpling that was real hot, i didnt chew enough and it got stuck in my throat. it was real hot i was choking on it and must have been in my throat for close to 10 seconds before i forced myself to swallow. now, it really really hurts to swallow. i do not know what to do to treat this. should i go to emergency room? it feels as if i am swallowing a razor blade. real sharp pain everytime i swallow. can someone please help or suggest something to me? this is the worst feeling in the world.

289,here's the situation:my girlfriend and i have chosen to be abstinent. we do some sexual acts, but when we do, she washes her hands before touching her vagina as do i. though, i only ever use my mouth just to be safe.however, today, she was playing sports and said she got the feeling of a period but nothing was there and it's a week early.is this common in women? there was nothing that came out as far as i know, but i don't know for sure. i don't see a likely way she could be pregnant, but i just want reassured so my mind doesn't start wandering.thanks soo soo much for any advice. i know to wait a week and see if she does get a period, i'm just worried about what she described.
290,my child is 5 year old. she went thru open heart surgery when she was 5 months old. the surgery went well and doctors said that she is as normal as other babies afterwards. she was normal for 5 years. her heart was of normal size.recently, due to cough and cold we went to the doctor and he suggested to do x-ray. the x-ray result suggests to have her heart. i am really very worried. dr. at gp suggested to see cardiologist in the hospital which could take around 2 months to get appointment. it is making me very tensed.i would like to know if heart enlargement is very dangerous? what could be the reasons behind? how long it will take to come to normal size? will it be treated through medication? could there be connection with her previous operation? she looks quite normal except that she coughs sometimes in the night. what are dos and don'ts for child so that it does not harm her heart.look forward for respose.worried mother
291,i had somewhat of a period from june 8th - 17th which wasn't heavy at all but was normal looking period blood. it's the 23rd and i woke up with heavy brown spotting and light pink blood. my partner and i have never used protection and he goes in me everytime. could this be a pregnancy symptom? i've taken two shots of depo and my appointment is soon to come up but i've decided not to go due to the fact that me and my partner actually want to have a baby soon. i am having cramps right now for the first time since i've been on depo. someone help me!
292,hi everyone,i need your help once again.    this morning while i was getting ready for the day, i tripped and fell in my room. fortunately, it was on the carpeting and not the tile floor.    my autistic granddaughter was here with me and was very upset that nam had fallen and wanted to call and ambulance and an adult as i had told her a couple of years ago that if i fell and she couldn't wake me up that she was to get an adult and they would call an ambulance and she remembered that all of this time.    :)i'm sore all over my body. my knee is swollen and bruised as well as bruises on my hands and arm. i can't do anything that involves heat because of the fentanyl patches so that eliminates andy baths or showers and that's what i really want to do. however, i haven't even been in a tub except to take a shower in over ten years as i can't get up out of them safely at all.i need any and all suggestions that don't involve heat if there is such a thing!! needless to say i am taking my bt meds but this pain is entirely separate from my normal hip and back and arthritic pain. my entire body is aching and throbbing from head to toe.thanks for any and all suggestions!!........sherryps i'm normally not clumsy like this as i'm very careful at all times to never fall.     :)
293,i work out all the time but i still have flab on my stomach. i can feel the six pack under it but cant seem to get off the flab! any suggestions on how to get rid of it? cuz whenever i do crunches or curls i just feel fatter cuz the muscles getting bigger but the squishy stuff is still there.
294,i am 29 years old and for two years i have had muscle twitching. it happens in my arms,face,hands and mostly my legs. very weird when your hand jumps off the bed.i have also dealt with what i call tics my head jerks sometimes i shrug my shoulder constantly and people have noticed some face expressions. i also have a issues with pain in my legs its a heaviness feeling and some times it gets so bad it feels as if my legs are going to colapse while im walking. i get migrains and get dizzy blurred vision occasionally. and there has been a few times i have been involved in a conversation and its like i disasppeared and when the fog lifted i missed most of what was said and i got dizzy and blurred vision right afterwards. i have had a emg it was normal and a abnormal eeg. any thoughts?
295,the following post i found on google.com when i looked up hypertension and tachycardia, and it was amazing, because what this lady's daughter is going through is exactly what i have been going through.    it all started shortly after i had a baby, her daughter is also the same age.    i has been noted that adrenalin seems to possibly be the cause of my tachy, but my adrenals have not been checked.samposted by ccf cardio md - dlb on march 23, 1999 at 10:55:06:in reply to: hyperbeta adrenergic syndrome posted by roberta on march 22, 1999 at 14:41:03:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------: can anyone help me to understand this diagnosis which was given to my daughter after many tests and different treatments for tachycardia? i am under the understanding that she does not have a heart problem but her body does not compensate to stress as a normal body does so her heart rate stays elevated. her problem semed to start after childbirth but over a long period of time became really bad to where she looked emanciated. she has gained weight since being on beta blockers and is also on antidepressants but sometimes she seems to loose her train of thought and we worry that all this medication is putting her in a worse predicament. she is 29yrs old and has not cut out her smoking 100% is it possible that the cigarets are causing all her problems in the first place? also i feel like she could possibly be manic depressive because she seems to go from a real high to a desperate low and lashes out at anyone in her path. i realize she feels bad and tired a lot but i would like to kow how to help her. thank you for any insight.

299,hi there. i recently had a dobutamine echo due to chest pains and palpitations.    i have started having high bp and have been on toprol for that. the results of the echo (read by my internal med doc) states that i have moderate mitral valve regurgitation. ok.. i know that can be fine for a long time. but they also said that i have a junctional rthym issue, with pac's during stress. my blood pressure has spiked to 186/110 and remained at least 150/100. this even after being on benacar and toprol. she has now doubled my toprol to 50mg and benicar is at 20. per day. she is obviosuly worried more about my high bp than anything, so doesnt suggest i see a heart doc as of yet. she also put me on seroquel to mellow my body out...? and has given my lorazepam for anxiety to not get my heart going...does this sound like a good plan? i am tired all of the time, and now really tired due to the seroquel. she thinks that all these meds combined will help my bp and therefore solve the rythm pac issue. can someone please give an opinion, and now i am just struggling to make it to work everyday!

303,can someone help me on this one?we suspect that our daughter might be using cocaine.    every couple weeks (after she's been at her mothers house), she comes back to our house with what appears to be cold symptoms...i.e. swollen neck glands, sore throat, runny nose, intense sneezing, etc.        she's usually sick for an entire week, only to have the process repeat itself in another couple weeks.my question is this...do you get cold symptoms that last this long from using cocaine?    she admitted to using it once, long ago, but her sickness frequency is on the rise.
304,i had two implants on # 12 and #13 and when the doctor put on the implant crown it felt like my mouth was in a vice.    it was affecting all the upper teeth like it was pushing on themand it was very painful. very painful. extremely.    the contact felt too tight between 12 and 13,    but the doctor said that it was fine.    the dental floss broke when i flossed.    i finally had him remove the implant crowns on 12 and 13.    i went to another doctor in another area 10 miles away.    he redid everything and, to my dismay, the same pain occured. the contact, however, was fine, and flossing was easy.    i went back the the oral surgeon who placed the implants and he checked everything and said the implants were perfect, and that it was what was on top of the implants.    how could my teeth have the exact same problem with two totally differnt doctors who placed two differnt sets of crowns.    any advice would be greatly appreciated.    i'm so miserable. and they're giving up on me. i can't live with this pain.    it's unbearable. thanks.
305,i'm 59, and had a stroke about 5 years ago. i don't remember the exact name - but it was described as blood getting between layers of a vein in part of my brain - causing it block. for the most part - i've pretty much recovered. the lingering effects are noticeable (only to me) in my speech and a very weird effect that i have a difficult time describing.i feel as if my head is being pulled to the right by some unknown source. this causes my neck to get tired and is very uncomfortable. i've described it to my neurologist and he said i'll just have to learn to deal with it. after 5 years of dealing with it - i'm wondering if there are any other options. i've tried deep massage therapy, and i'm thinking of trying accupunture. i have no vertigo - just a very weird sensation.any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

307,i am a 23 years old man. i hope my english is understandably.please read my message about my pain, can you tell me, if this is the same symptoms as you had experienced. it dosent sound like real prostatitis symptoms, because i dont have frequent urination and i have this highlighted/swollen penis tip. most in the morning or after masturbating (very swollen    )i would first do my disease process clear to you, then describe the symptoms as those are experienced: i have now for over 1 year had pain comparable, to those described as chronic pelvic pain/prostatitis. sometimes it's so unbearable that i just cry like a litle baby girl. i have kept a half year break from my university, because of this disease.it started by me in a period of very sedentary work, sudden (within 1-2 days) experienced severe pain below the penis (just where the testicles are) and along with the penis (if i pressed on the urethra/corpus spongiosum) every time i changed position from seated to lying in bed, to go, do fitness or just touched the area, stood or sat down or crossed my legs it would feel like electric shock was send into the penis, it was crazy (only lasting the seconds it tooks to shift position so that was like 40-50 times a day) fortunately eased this pain in its strength, i would say if it was 10 on a scale, it has now assumed a chronic phase i would describe as 3-4. which has lasted the last 3 month.have done cytoscopi, scans of the penis and bladder, 4-5 test for all stds, over 50 tests for inflammation (have a home kit) and 4 test for inflammation at the doctor (the last 3 month), all negative. been studied by prostate massage. and have a total of 18 visits from 6 doctors, including my brother. medicine tested: alfusozin, antibiotics (tetracycline) haven't worked for me.one of the doctors have recently commented my penis head, which is clearly red and swollen and has been since onset of symptoms. the red and swollen meatus (penis tip) seems not to be related to chronic pelvic pain (or prostatitis) from what i've read, for example from wise anderson.these are my symptoms:- when i pee, there's a bit irritation inside the urethra. i must milking and shaking the penis, 10-20 times, after i urinated. but it is never enough. the urine is still inside the urethra, when i leave the toilet. sometimes it can be triggered when i sit down or move around in different positions. the feeling of urin in my urethra is very unpleasant, maybe one of the worst in my condition.- my panties are always wet after i have urinated.- the penis tip is red and clearly highlighted, swollen, (as a red mouth with two lips), sometimes 1 millimeter high.and very sensitive.- muscle spasms often most marked just below the testicles and the closest to the rectum. the rectum can also sometimes spasm a bit. in fact my penis also spasm like + 20 times a day, when i am sitting and relaxing, it- pain during sex along the underside. and when sperm release: directly unbearable contractions in the muscle below the penis (possibly prostate)- reduced urine flow- pain along the urethra (the outside of the penis as if it is hyper-sensitive) when i press on the urethra it is making it worse.- pain in the rectum, inside, as if you have hemorrhoids, or cuts high in the rectum (well maybe it is prostate?)- pain in the penis, largely located everywhere, primarily along the shaft and sometimes a throbbing pain in the penis head as i pounded on it with a stone.- pain in the penis tip when i hit it but also just generally electrical sensations in the penis tip.hope to hear from any of you
308,a couple of weeks ago i had a stomach virus that subsided after a couple of days.    however, 2 days ago i woke up with a very bloated, gurgling stomach.    i felt so full that i had no appetite and had nothing to eat all day.    at about 10pm that night i became very nauseous and was up all night with vomiting and diarrhea and had a fever of 100.8.    i am still very bloated and nauseous.    can this be another stomach virus so soon?
309,i just spent 4 hours having another (third) emg test on my legs and back.    dr has already told me i have some sort of (brain dust) his words, also, braxial plexopathy, peripherial neuoropathy and    now radiculaphy in my thorasic and lumbar spine.    i cn't take these emgs anymore, im exhaused when i.m through.    i can barely walk.dr. continues to say it's on the wane now, but then tells me i hav e added something new.    im having an mri tomorrow but probably won't hear about this until i return in 2 months.somedays i'm so weak, somedays i'm in bad pain, i have no shooting pain down my legs, so i don't think it's lumbar related, i don't hve artheritis, or osteoarthrisis.    i did take heavy meds for 2 years for another problem.    i do think the meds caused the problem.    dr. says he thinks whatever it is will leave me with resiual weakness just as my arm has.should i find a new dr, or is this how it all goes, for everyone.    what is an inconclusive mri mean.    i never heard of brain dust and i'm starting to be afraid.     any help will be appreciated.
310,my dad has a retnetion cyst in his sphynoid sinus.    he is beginning to have some blurred vision.    we can't get an appointment with a dr. until next week.    is there anything that we can buy over the counter to help slow down the progression.    he is on an antibiotic.    please help.
311,about 20 years ago, i fell, walking down a dewey, grassy hill and instantly fell flat on my back. the next day i couldn't move my neck and the pain was intense. i have terrible problems with my neck now and i do believe i broke my neck, what i mean by that is, i cracked a vertebrae. is cracking a vertebrae breaking the neck? i have an osteophyte surrounding the crack and have suffered with pain for many years. i didn't have insurance, at the time, so i didn't get help, as well, i had to work to take care of my child so i kept going, though i'm not sure how i did it. so, that is my question, is cracking a vertebrae considered to be breaking the neck?
312,i keep on waking up throughout the night with both feet, arms and hands asleep it takes about an hour after getting up for them to feel right? i weight around 260 lbs and have very large breast 44ff. could this be what is causing it, could i be compressing a nerve in my sleep?

318,i'm a female ... mid forties... active and up until now, in good healthi've never had a problem with my knees, but a week ago i was laying across the bed and a severe pain struck me behind the knee cap. i was in tears instantly.it is a constant pain... varying from a dull ache and amping up to a crescendo of high pitch... there is no pattern to it... walking or laying down makes no difference. there is no position where there is relief.i don't like to take pain pills, they upset my stomach but had a few loratabs left from a dental problem. they lowered the volume, but still the pain was intense. my family doctor referred me to an orthopedic surgeon and prescribed percocet until my appointment. same results as the loratabs.the pain in my knee set off a topical pain down the front of my shin... i can control that with elcon cream. it also affects the sartorius muscle  , but i can vibrate that and it stops. those areas have different types of pain, but both radiate from the knee.2 days ago i woke up and a brown bruise about the size of a quarter was on the side of my knee cap. it's not a bad bruise, but there are 2 black dots about half inch apart inside of the bruise. they look like small punctures, sort of like you get with a shot.today, i saw the specialist... i've used him before for a frozen shoulder and had excellent results with a cortisone type injection in the shoulder joint.he took a few images and couldn't see a problem. then he spent about 20 minutes checking all the pressure points. he explained, that certain points when pressed would indicate the problem and that i wouldn't be able to stand his touching it. nothing hurt any worse when he pressed, but the pain was already severe. when i didn't react, he checked them again and was puzzled by my lack of reaction.when he saw the bruise, he questioned me at length about how it got there. when i finally made him understand, it just came there while i was asleep, he said he'd never seen anything like that. i asked if there was something leaking from under the kneecap and he said no.he said that without further tests, he couldn't tell what was wrong. he said, this was the first time in his career he had seen a patient be in such pain, without responding when the pressure point was pressed. i asked him about tests and he said an mri.... without explanation, that is out for me.i asked for a cortisone shot and he agreed to try it... but said it might take as long as 72 hours to feel the full effect. he didn't come right out and say it, but he didn't appear to think it would do much good... but wouldn't hurt to try.has anyone here had a similar problem, or know of something i can ask him to check?thanks in advance for any informationsassy_
319,i was hospitalised with left side bacterial pneumonia and fluid around the lung. i was in for 4 days on iv antibiotics.    i felt ok for a week, then felt worse. went to my doc who after examination, said it had probably not cleared and gave me a 10 day course of antibiotics.    i finished these felt no better and got a chest x ray, all clear. still having chest pain, very strong pain in lower back on left side which radiates.it keeps me awake at night, i take pain relief and use heat packs to alleviate it.doc thinks it is just 'post pneumonia' muscle pain.    a small act such as brushing my hair or climbing the stairs leaves me with muscle ache. i am 42, non smoker and feel rubbish. any suggestions? it has now been 5 weeks since i was diagnosed.
320,hi. on may 10th i fell on my arm and it resulted in a radial head fracture and ulnar collateral ligament avulsion. my orthopedic felt that since i wasn't an athlete that i would not need surgery to repair the unattached ligament. i have been in physical therapy 3 times a week since this happened and my arm will still not go completely straight and i'm also having slow progress with the reflection of my arm. my medical insurance runs out in a few months so i am trying to get this arm fixed as quick as i can. i have decided to seek a second opinion to make sure that surgery wouldn't be the best option. however, i am afraid that i do not have the time or money to do surgery now and then more physical therapy after the surgery before my insurance expires. i am getting on with another insurance company but they will not cover anything with my arm because it is a pre-existing injury. i am interested in hearing from anyone who knows anything about this type of injury. i am concerned that without surgery the stability and durability of my arm might be affected.
321,i've been told there is a test to see if 911 should be called for someone suspected of havine a stroke.    the test consists of three actions to ask the suspected stroke victim to perform.    the three questions are;1) ask the person to smile.2) ask the person to raise both arms.3) ask the person to speak a simple sentence.supposedly, if the person can't do one or more of these things, there's a chance he's having a stroke.    is this true?    is there any case in which it's not true?thanks in advance!john
322,i am so bored with the diet that i find myself reaching for what my husband and grandson are eating. i'm not necessarily hungry. i've lost 6 pounds, even with the cheating, and have been on the plan, second time around, for 11 days. i need some recipes to liven up the food. chicken has been tasting very gamie to me and i hate eating it now. i love doing beef stew beef in the crockpot with a can of beef broth, a can of tomatos (sometimes with chillies), a head of cabbage and one onion. i know this is mixing the veggies though and you are only supposed to have one of the veggies per meal.    suggestions, please?virginia
323,in august i had caught the flu from a family member and was quite bad (fever, coughing fits, crackling in chest, coughing up fluid/flem for a month even when recovering) but i never noticed any swelling of glands, nor did i have a sore throat. in october i noticed a lump in the left side of my neck and when i went to the doctor she said she noticed another swollen node on same side and that my tonsils were a tad swollen and red, she said that they can swell after an infection has gone away. got blood tests done and said everything waas fine and that swollen nodes less than an inch and dont hurt are nothing to worry about, but a few days ago i think ive found a swollen lymph node on the right hand side of my groin(no tenderness and rubbery, maybe from constantly touching it so i may have aggravated it). swhould i get a second opinion? i mean i trust the doctors ive had but im a bit of a hypocondriac.
324,in 2003 i had a lumbarectomy on l5. it star with a bulging disc at l5, the docs wentin an put it ack twice until it ruptured, then they put a cage in. i've been getting injections in my back periodically that use to do it for me. i had one two weeks ago and it has not helped much at all. the numness in both legs, with the left the worst my doc says my disc is bulging again with it pushing on a nerve. i have 4 young grandchildren i'd like to be able to play with without laying up for 2days afterward. i'm only 40(almost) and like a clean house, nice yard, and try to enjoy my garden, but its impossible to keep up when one day in the garden lays me on the couch for 2 days. or one day of thoroughly cleaning my house does the same. what options do i have available with the cage already in there? i've got to do something besides pain meds and injections.they are not helping and i don't want to be on anything stronger than hydro 10 or i'm still laying around from no energy. any suggestions?

327,just got the mail, social security denied the review of my claim. i was laid off over a year ago as a computer programmer. my performance was lagging i will be the first to admit. i tried to work through the symptoms but the fatigue, body aches, and most of all the cognitive and memory skills required for my job. social security says your physical condition does not significantly limit my daily activities.    the evidence does show that you have psychological limitations with concentration, persistance and pace. we have determined that you retain the capacity to perform your past work as a computer programmer. i have a letter from my doctor stating my current state and that when treatment begins (in a couple of weeks) that for the next 18 months i should be on disability. i called my lawyer (who is on a 25% contingency fee) and he said that it will take nine to twelve months for a hearing. i don't know what to do? anyone have any suggestions?
328,i keep getting reacuring yeast infections each month. i am unemployed and only have medicaid share of cost but cant afford the share of cost (imagine that.) i have seen a couple doctors and they all tell me that they just find a little bit a yeast. i'm miserable and moody now because i just can't seem to figure out what the problem is. it seems as if it all started after my second miscarrage(miscarriage)4 months ago. i am extremly itchy and uncomfortable! it does not burn when i pee but after takeing monistat day 1 treatment it has been burning after i wipe after peeing. i had no discharge until after useing monistat day 1 treatmnt. i have read that many women have problems with monistat day one so i'm not sure what to do now. i think i made the problem worse...it feels worse. i can not afford another $20-$30 over the counter treatments anymore. i spend almost $50 a month on them. i'm sooo tired of feeling this way and very sexually frustrated. doctors have mentioned laposcopy as the last options knowing that endometriosis runs in my family. the problem is that i dont have a regular doc anymore so the others just do the same testing and want me to keep comeing back. i can not afford any more doctors visits nor monistat so i was desperate and turned to home remedies which has worked somtimes before when i got a yeast infection. i have tryed sea salt in bath water, apple syder viniger in the bath water, tons of garlic cloves, tea tree oil and azo yeast pills. nothing is working at all!!! i took monistat 7 days ago and left my body alone for 4 days until my infection seemd to be getting worse is when i tryed home remidies. i have also used my prescription topical cream the doc prescribed from the last yeast infection, it help last time but not a all this time! they have given me diflucin    think its called 2 times last month but i'm not sure if i works. i'm miserable and ran out of my options. the only doc now that acepts medicaid can't see me for another month and my original doc no longer takes medicaid :( there had been no change in my diet, eating the same as before all this. not sure if i've been tested for diabetes before but i'm sure i would know if i had diabeties. i was just tested for std's last month (which was the clinic that prescribed me my topical cream and deflican) negative hiv and negative everything except for hepitis a but he said thats good that i tested possitive for that but that it wasnt good that i tested negativ for another type of hepititis(hepatitis)b. he suggested a vaccine saying that i could easliy catch it next time it comes around and that he sees that i had it before but must have been treated for it. to my recognition i have never been told i had hepitits nor have been treated with shot like he explaind.last month i had a normal period not very heavy and went by quick but 2 weeks later i started bleeding again 2 days of regular bleeding and 5 days of spotting. this month my period was due on the 7th it is now the 14th and no period. tested 3 different time with a home pregnancy test and all 3 negatives. is there anyone out there that knows of any other method i could try? and what could be going on? the doctors these days seem to realy just want to push u out the door just telling u anything and everything to put u at easy but nevr seem to get down to the problem. i want a laposcopy done because i know there is something wrong and my mother has had endometriosis so i'm thinking it is that. i do not know how to request a laposcopy to my new doc i wil see in a month, she will just want to do the same tests just to see for her self what the cause is. but i'm sooo tired of doing the same **** i want to get to the bottom of it. im not sure if medicaid will cover laposcopy if i suggest it and if it is not needed in the docs eyes.is there anything else i can try until my doc appointment. is vagisil the same thing? any advice would be much appreciated! thanks for reading

330,do partial complex seizure disorders have the same symptoms as autism (high functioning).    if they are pretty much the same what are the differences in them.
331,i am new to the forums and have a question for the good doctor for i think i may need to see one. i thought i had a minor case of food poisoning over this past weekend and dealt with it as opposed to going to the doctors/emergency room. the symptoms were related to food poisoning nausea, diarrhea, muscle fatigue, joint cramps (these last 2 related to slight dehydration). well this is my 3rd day and the frequency of the diarrhea has not lessened but i did get my appetite to eat.so i chopped up 2 heads of romaine lettuce into a bowl and figured the healthy food would be all the better. the thing is i had to go to the bathroom roughly 4-5 hours later, and i need to point something out first... over the first 2 days it was all liquid for i had nothing to eat or left in my system. ok so about 4-5 hours after eating the green leafy stuff i had to go to the bathroom, and that is what came out. now this reallt scared me for i was taught in school 18-22 hours it usually takes to get through the digestive system. with approx 4 hours taking to get out of the stomach alone.so my question is do i have need for much concern or am i pretty much feeling the aftereffects of not having anything in my system and it just passing though me especially since it is highly fibrous?please help.this discussion is related todigestion too fast?.
332,my youngest daughter (19months old) is having problems with toe-walking/dragging, as well as delayed speach.    we took her to her normal pediatrician who says she has muscle wasting in her hip area.    he really wouldn't give me any ideas of what he felt was wrong other than he felt that structurally she was okay.    he felt it was most likely neruological (he didn't say what or possible causes) he did have us do some xrays, which came back perfect.    so now we are waiting for the insurance approval of an apointment with a neurologist.    i am very stressed.    what should i expect?    everything i am reading about toe-walking/dragging, neruological disorders, and speach delay point to cerebral palsy.    i am crazy stressed to say the least.    what should i be expecting from our first visit?
333,i have had a persistent pulsing sensation in my face and neck for almost 2 years now. it is aggravated by exertion and also sugar will make it worst. it gets so bad it makes me nausated. i also get the pulsing in my stomach. i get shortness of breath with also. by the end of my work day there are times i just can't even move its so bad i just have to sit still. i have been to so many doctors and can't get any answers. my cardiologist put me on nadalol 20 mls every other day. this help me so very much. i was getting a lot of pvcs. it helps the pulsating but i can't take it every day because my blood pressure get to low. please if anyone can help me. this is interfering with my life. i am so fatigued and ill feeling i just drag myself through each day.
334,i've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and i'm going back to my primary doctor with questions about being insulin resistant. i constantly feel fatigued and light-headed, constant mood swings, and if i haven't eaten in a while (resulting in low blood sugar), or eat something with high sugar in it (resulting in high blood sugar), my symptoms worsen.as a prediabetic, and possibly insulin resistant, should i be testing my glucose levels regularly? should i go see an endocrinologist?
335,i have a upper molar on the right side that showed some cloudiness upon xray but has been asymptomatic.    i was told that as told it may need re-treatment at some point.    that was several months ago.    i now have acute pain on the right side of my upper nose, sneezing, post nasal drip and a little swelling on the rt. side of my nose.    is there a connection or are these symptoms due to something else?
336,my nefew(age-7year male.) is facing problem with his urine ejaculation. as per the doctors- due to some probelm in connection between the kidny and urinary bladder, the urine is not passing properly to blader from kidny. so urine is not getting diposited in his urinary bladder, the result of this urine is coming out frequently through his pennis. doctor says - one small bone is missing or supressed at the    bottom of his spinal cord. due to that urine is not getting deposited in his bladder. when we asked for surgury, they told that its very riskful to go for a surgory, because the child age is very less to make any surgury and also any mistake in surgury will lead to paralysis. please advice on the same, whether we should go for the surgury or not? if yes then how safe it will be? whether surgury is advisable or not? if not any other way is there to solve the problem.due to this problem he is unable to sit in school even if he is a very good scolar. kindly advice on the same.

339,** virgin, and no sexual activity. and no infections. i saw a gyno and was told that i was being irritated to the soap, fabric softer or the tightness of my clothes. i wear loose fitting cotton underwear. i had mentioned to them that i was experiencing mainly pinchy like sensations and achy where inner labias meet clit. i had cleaned there almost everyday in a warm bath, which i was told not to clean so deaply because vagina is self cleaning and it has a certain ph. but with the small amount of build up that i am to allow, i feel as if i had a small piece of toilet paper between the clit and left inner labia. it was a sensation like minor pin like pokes, i'd hardly call it pinching. but more like a dragging of a fine needle too, just like something was there. so i had gently cleaned only that side off build up, and no longer had that feeling when i was sitting. but sometimes during the time of ovulating and or just before my period, when i walk i can get a scraping like skratch, like a dragging of the two tissues against eachother, and it is quiet painful. it only happens during a couple steps that i take, and it fades away when i slow down my walking. this is the most form of pain i can get. is this because i cleaned the build up away a day ago? or is it because i am expecting my period any day now? oh, i can sometimes be slitghly itchy but i dont feel the need to skratch or rub it away. my secretions are normal, im told. please answer, thanks!! any suggestions as to what this can be and/or what i can do to make it better please? can it be clitorodynia? or?this discussion is related toswollen lump on outer vagina/groin.

354,i work in a state mental facility in direct care.    this happened in november 2009.    one day while at work, i started to feeling really funky, so i had the lpn check my blood pressure, it was 195/95.    she has me if i had a headache or sick to my stomach, of which i replied no.    she said maybe it was from dealing with the individuals.    i said i had been on lunch break for 30 minutes.    she did check it a few more times the rest of the day.    a couple days later, while on my days off, it shot up again.    i ended up calling 911 and then the paramedics arrived they checked my blood pressure and it was 200/100.    he gave me some baby aspirin, a nitroglycerin and put me on oxygen and took me to the er.    they did blood work, ekg, and the automatic blood pressure cuff, and every 15 minutes it would check my blood pressure, and would set off the alarm, it ranged between 165/80 to 170/80, after a few hours, the doctor came in and said there was nothing wrong to follow up with my regular doctor.    when i went in, they took my blood pressure and it was 190/120, he wanted to put me into the hospital, to get blood pressure down, but since it was thanksgiving weekend(thanksgiving day, the next day), unless i had a heart attack, they wouldn't do much.    he put me on diovan 160 mg and lopressor 25 mg, he then had me go to a heart doctor.    i had been keeping track of my blood pressure on a regular basis and when the heart doctor saw my readings(average 165/80)over the last 1.5 years, he doubled the diovan and had me start taking the lopressor 2 times a day, ran test, because of my blood pressure running so high for so long(i never thought much about it, because it was consistant).    he was concerned i would have an enlarged heart.    after all the test, he said my heart was slightly enlarged, i had an ascending aorta aneurysm, but it is not large enough to worry about and also have 2 leaky valves, but they are not leaking enough to worry about.    i have went to him on a regular basis, the last time i went, he said the aneurysm and the leaky valves have not gotten worse.    i had went on a low-sodium diet, back in november 2009 and i average around 1200-1300 mg sodium a day, my blood pressure has improved but it was in the high 120's/80 and he said he was toying with the idea of increasing my blood pressure medicine.    i also take a baby aspirin a day.    now my question, my pulse runs 45 to 55, 90 % of the time.    it does get up to 70 to 80.    i do wear one of those chest straps that sends signal to my watch and one in a blue moon my pulse will get up to 90-100, but my average pulse for the day will still be around 55.    could the aneurysm or leaky valves be causing this?    my co-workers have been really concerned, because of the low pulse and have had the lpn check my blood pressure/pulse.i have severe sleep apnea which i have tried the cpap and the bipap with no success, also had the so-called sleep apnea surgery with no success.    i also had heart cauterization in september 2003, because of chest pains and was told them that i had a small amount of blockage, but everyone has a little.    this was by the same heart doctor that i am seeing now.i am 6' tall and weigh around 230 pounds, i know this is a little over weight, but have also been on a low-fat diet also.    i was up to 265 pounds in november 2009.
355,i had graves disease and my thryoid ablated in 2006.    i started out taking synthroid and cytomel, 137 mg of synthroid and 10 mg cytomel.    i switched to generic versions of both a few months ago, because of the price.    i have now gained 5 more pounds.    in addition, 2 months ago my dr lowered my dosage to 125 mg. which she said was supposed to help with the weight.    i have been exercising and doing weight watchers and the weight will not come off.    help. .

360,ive only had one partner, with whom i engaged in unprotected vaginal sex with, but we made sure to keep especially clean, not letting fluids or our parts get anything but the opposing organs, and regularly washing right after intercourse.however, while we were together, she cheated with two other guys, both unprotected as well. both guys had just recently tested negative across the board. no other sex occurred.we have split, and it is now 6 months later. i read that something like 70% of stds are 'asymptomatic' and most dont know they have them. i called her, she has no symptoms and niether do the guys she was with. i have no symptoms at all as well, but how likely is it i have an std of any sort?
361,we have been having this problem for a while now, after sex i get little red bumps on the head of my penis they are similar to a small pimple without a whit head. when this started happening we started using condoms and we had no problems and she went to the doctor and tested clear fot stds so we got rid of the condoms and the same bumps and nasty smell came back, she has no symyoms of anything . could i maybe be allergic to her?

363,washington (ap) -- the food and drug administration on friday warned women not to use or purchase mommy's bliss nipple cream, marketed by mom enterprises inc. of san rafael, california.the cream, promoted to nursing mothers to help soothe dry or cracked nipples, contains ingredients that may cause respiratory distress, vomiting and diarrhea in infants, the agency said.the potentially harmful ingredients in the cream are chlorphenesin and phenoxyethanol.fda is particularly concerned that nursing infants are being unwittingly exposed by their mothers to this product with dangerous side effects, said janet woodcock, director of the center for drug evaluation and research. additionally, these two ingredients may interact with one another to further compound and increase the risk of respiratory depression in nursing infants.the company has stopped selling the cream. the fda said consumers should stop using the cream and consult a doctor if they experience problems or believe that their infant may have experienced problems due to the product.mothers whose children may have suffered adverse effects because of this product should contact the fda's medwatch at 800-332-1088.http://www.cnn.com/2008/health/05/23/fda.nipple.cream.ap/index.html
364,hello,i went to the doctor yesterday and i was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide for my blood pressure.    i am really skeptical about taking this medication, or any medication for that matter.    i am 21 years old and i cannot figure out why my blood pressure is high in the first place.    i do have a lot of anxiety problems and i wonder if that contributes to it.    i also take paxil for my anxiety and i have been told that can cause high blood pressure.    so my questions are:is hydrochlorothiazide something that can be discontinued later after my blood pressure lowers or is it a drug that is meant to be taken long term?has anyone had experience with paxil causing high blood pressure?thanks.
365,two days ago, i experienced extreme and painful (what i think) bladder spasms. these spasms or contractions occured every 40 seconds and lasted for about 10 seconds. the spasms were extremely painful, shooting to the left side of my left breast and into my cervix. it was excruciating. massaging the area only made it worse, it was only after an hour of placing hot packs and taking a painkiller (nurofen 200 mg) that the spasms subsided, although i can still feel slight spasms.i have a mass growing on the outside of the bladder and is believed by doctors to be endometriosis. since i am trying to conceive (at age 35), my fertility specialist has suggested to hold of on any surgery to remove this mass and focus on getting pregnant.i was wondering if i should seek medical help and whether i would need to reconsider the urgency of having this mass removed.any suggestions?
366,i developed a case of shingles the last of january and was presicribed hydrocoden 750mg 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hours for the pain.on may 15 i went to a different physician who prescribed oxycoden 20mg 1x12 hrs. initially the oxy made me feel much better & i had more energy.i soon felt a need to take more to get the same effect, so i started taking (2) in the morning and (1) in the evening. on a subsequent visit he assured me that with a body weight of 290# there was no problem taking (2) 20mg in the morning and (1) in the evening.i have been taking pain killers for over 6 months and am convinced that i am addicted. i do not need them for pain but i take them to maintain a certain feeling.i quit taking the oxy 48 hrs ago and have experienced chills, hot flashs, nausea, a runny nose, sneezing, and i feel terrible.i still do not have any physical pain except that associated with withdrawal.my question is will 200 mg ibuprofen help my withdrawal (especially sleeping) or should i just continue suffering until my body has cleansed itself of the oxy addiction?
367,my father has advanced congestive heart disease and his doctor has suggested hospice care. my father is against getting such care. the doctor has sent him to have the fluid drained at the hospital twice in the last 3 months. he is having it done again tomorrow. i think it is called parastetes? my question is what will happen next? how long does he have to live weeks or months?
368,i have had two months of persistent headaches (more acute when i move my head, and all the pain localized to my left temple); intermittent dizziness; daily ringing/roaring in my ears.i had a mri w/ and w/o contract, and with my doc on his day off i do not entirely understand the results.    i'm clear that there is no mass/tumor, but unclear about the white matter... can anyone help elucidate?    for context, i'm 45years old, male, a thyroid (papillary cancer) survivor, and extremely healthy/fit... and i've had no prior history of headaches or tinnitus or dizziness.    the mri says:there is mild amorphous and hazy deep and periventricular cerebral white matter t2 hyperintensity in the posterior cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, mainly parietal and occipital lobes.    there is also a small indistinct focus of peripheral white matter t2 hyperintensity measuring about 6mm across in the right parietal lobe.no enhancing or space-occupying intracranial mass.unremarkable findings in the regions of the internal auditory canals and pituitary fossa.    normal enhancement of the major dural venous sinuses.mild potentially chronic multifocal paranasal sinus mucosal thickening, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses are most notably involved.    no acute mastoid fluid collections.    the major arterial skull base flow voids are present.there is a ton of stuff online about white cerebral matter, but i do not have ms or lupus or lyme's disease symptoms; i have very healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels; and etc...i'm supposed to be referred to a neurologist... but what to make of things based on this report?    thanks!
369,i woke up this morning and my ring finger on left hand is completely numb at the tip, no matter how much i massage it,it won't wake up.why is this?it has been over 4 hours now
370,let's start from the beginning, i got my period for the first time when i was about 14, it was not regular. to regulate it they put me on *good god if i can remember the brand* birth control pills. i forgot to take them a lot so the doctor suggested i use depo.i was never regular with the depo. i would get my period sometimes, not at all, and at one point for 6 months straight, every day. the doctors at the office i went to said that this should be normal.well after being on that for several years *i am now coming up on my 21st birthday* i decided in november of last year that i wanted to think about concieving, as it takes a little while to adjust and i was still thinking about it, i decided to take yaz for a short time.the yaz made me very sick to my stomach so i decided in january that i wanted to ttc and stopped taking it. during the time i    took that i was completely regular, as well as for several months after.in april i received my period 5 days late, then in may i received it the same 5 days late. i considered that maybe with the stress in my current situation as i lost my job that i could have just missed it and it was normal again.in june i received my period 12 days after that 5, so technically 17 days late.in july i did not receive my period at all, it is now november and i have yet to receive it from july,.i went to a doctor after taking 3 negative pregnancy tests in aug. and they told me that everything looked fine i just may not be ovulating. they advised me to see an obgyn. well, i do not have employment and do not have insurance. i have had some abdominal pain that i think may be cysts forming and popping *this runs in my family*, i have also had an over abundant amount of discharge and some days it is milky and some days it is chunky.i tested again recently with another negative result :(could anyone give me some advice as to what my next step should be, please don't suggest anything to do with seeing a specialist unless you can help me with a way around the insurance part of it because as i don't have a job there isn't a load of spare change and i would have to save to go and see a doctor, i'm not thoroughly concerned with conceiving right now (it would be lovely, but..) as i need to find work before hand, but i am concerned about my health and the fact that i could have damaged something by being on the depo for so long and not have the ability to have children.thank you so much,alex
371,i've been having a period since august 2008 and its    now february 2009. it got so bad and heavy, that i became anemic. i went to the doctor the other day for the first time, and she put me on birth control...femcon fe...and also made me an appointment to have an internal sonogram or ultrasound whatever it's called. well my concern is obvioulsy the pain. i'm a virgin and have never used tampons....i have not found anyone who can tell me what an internal sono feels like that is a virgin. so please, if you have had one done, tell me what to expect.
372,at day 19 i thought i would be completely finished with these xanax wd's but they keep coming and coming.    late last night i watched a commercial about lunesta and they mentioned that a common side effect was new or worsening depression.    that caught my attention so i began to frantically research ambien and every article i've read lists new or worssening depression as a common side effect.    i've been taking ambien off & on for the past 2 years..usually only 1/2 a tablet.    i can now see a correlation between times i've been taking ambien and an increase in my depression and i'm certain that ambien has lengthened my detox time from xanax.just now...out of nowhere....my heart begain to beat as though it would come out of my chest.    me ears started to ring and i began to instantly sweat.    what shocks me is how quickly this came on and caught me completely by surprise.    i reazlie this is apart of the detox process and probable due to an ambien side effect.
373,my sister in law is pregnant and her docter told her that she has a blood infection and that is was the baby that was causing it, the only thing they gave her was fluids antibitics and a medicine for anitvomiting. she has been really sick alwayts vomiting and she had a bladder infection before she was pregnant and still has it. i have been doing research and the only thing i can finnd that it could be was septicemia(sepsis).    she is only about 10 weeks or so, and has already lost about 40 pounds they told her it was cause of the baby but i keep think that it has to be something else.
374,my urologist suspects bladder cancer, but has not done a cystoscopy yet.    he has ordered an renal ultrasound and wanted me to come in for the cystocopy right after the ultrasound test.    however, his office called and cancelled cystoscopy test, as he has surgury, but when i tried to reschedule his office told me to have the ultrasound first and wait for the results before rescheduling the cystoscopy.my question is:    isn't the cystocopy the only real way to tell if there is bladder cancer?    should i be concerned that the office is not letting me schedule that procedure now?i just don't want to wait for the ultrasound test and then have to wait 2 weeks to get an appointment for the cystoscope after the results of the ultrasound.
375,i had a mammogram and ultrasound due to a mass i found in my right breast a few weeks ago.    i am 46 years old.    the ultrasound report stated that i had a possible fibroadenoma and that it was a circumscribed hypoechoic mass.    the ultrasound says that i am an assessment 4 at the bottom of the report.    i will be seeing a surgeon soon because the radiologist recommended i have a biopsy.    from what i read it is very unusual for someone my age to have a fibroadenoma.    i have not had a period in almost 2 years and have not taken any hormones.    what is an assessment 4?    any comments are welcome.
376,i read somewhere on another site that eczema can cause the herpes simplex virus to be more serious than usual. is this true. if yes, how-so?

379,i was tested for herpes the last two years when i was in a committed/managomous relationship with exboyfriend .    recently i had sex with another guy and i found out    i had herpes.    the new guy claims he's never had any sypmtoms and no other girl besides me has had an outbreak    after having sex with him.    the twist in this story is i had sex with my exboyfriend again inbetween dating new guy.sex was unprotected with both parnters. the new guy has created vaginal tears twice which is accompianied with what i now know is an outbreak.    i had herpes blood test done right after the first tear/outbreak and my results were negative. when i got the second outbreak, i tested positive for herpes. is it possible that i've had herpes for a while and it never showed up in a blood/swab test because i never had an outbreak or is it for sure from the new guy? and the other twist is that my vaginal tear was swabbed and i came up postive for herpes but when i did the blood test i came up positve for hsv 1 not hsv 2.

383,hello,i am having my yearly labs done tomorrow, i called to ask my endo if he would add in addition to tsh a freet4 and freet3, vitamin d and b12.    he agreed and said i could add them onto the lab slip that i already have. my question is, is it better to have a total t3 or a free t3.    i have been having many hypo symptoms, dizziness(new), muscle pains, fatigue etc.    i want to make to be able to have the full picture on my results when i see him.thanks in advance for any input.
384,what happens when you are in sever pain and you call your doctor and he says to go to the emergency room.    the emergency room doc gives you and injection and gives you a small number of a different med for breakthrough pain.    he gave explicit instructions not to take both of the breakthrough meds.    is it safe to get the meds from the hospital filled since the pm doc sent me there?    or is that the unpardonable sin?help...severe pain
385,in 2009, about a year ago, i had a nuclear stress test. i have mild angina, and had a stent installed in my right coronary artery in 2003. during the test i had severe chest pains, my brow was sweating and i had a difficult time breathing (it felt like a heart attack). when the test was over, the discomfort went away, but i was very tired and light headed. the cardiologist told me that it was not unusual to have that experience. my wife took the same test and had no discomfort (she does not have heart desease). i'm do for another stress test next month (but a treadmill type instead of nuclear). should i be concerned. by the way, the test results were ok.
386,i have hpv however last month from october 10th to nov 5th i was bleeding. at first it was really heavy brown discharge that i was seeing for the first 3 weeks then it was blood for 7 days. do you know what this is? can anyone help out. what should i do because i am very concern about my health.thanks,
387,hello i am mike and i have been having a rash problem going on 4 years now.when ever my body temperature rises from exercising, sunlight, temperature, anxiety, nervousness; pretty much anything that will cause the body temperature to rise i will break out in a extremely painful rash with hives on my abdomen, chest, lower and middle back, neck, scalp, underarms and feet. i have been tested for all common allergens and nothing.the symptoms started when i tried out an acne medication at first being my first medication i thought this was what was supposed to happen. after stopping the use the rashes went away until 1 day in high school woods class i had a major break out and it has been non stop ever since.oddly enough depending the temperature the rashes will not come. if i am in a warm climate from wake till sleep i will have no rash. if its a cool day and i exercise, shower or well do anything i will break out.allergy medication like benadryl and claritin do little use and take awhile for the pain to stop.the rash remains around 30minutes after the pain subsides before it goes away and i usually will not have another break out after that no matter what i do.ps: sorry for the long post its just i would like to know what is wrong because it is very hard for me to do anything while trying to keep my body temperature down.
388,i had a baby 7 months ago and my vagina doesn't feel the same or look the same. and every time i have sex it feels loose. what can i do to make it tighter please...

390,i was in the er late friday night with severe pain in my right side - below my rib cage that radiated to my back in the general area of my kidney. i had already been treated the week before in the same er for a uti with antibiotics and a mild pain medication.    this new pain came out of no-where and would not go away with otc medication - aleve, ibuprofen and tylenol gave me no relief.after the er physician reviewed a ct scan of my abdomen, he found a mass on my left ovary (about 5 cm). we are not sure if it is just a cyst, or a solid mass.    with my history of ovarian cysts during my teen years, i'm still very concerned. my concern is that i have no pain on my left side what-so-ever. my question is two-parts: first, how large is an ovary, and second, what are the chances of this particular mass being malignant (considering i am asymptomatic - other than the pain on my right side)?thank you!

393,i posted this in the wrong forum earlier.    i had sex on day 6.    i ovulated on day 10.    i had pink and brown spotting on day 20.    on day 21 and 22, more brown spotting only when i wiped.    today is day 23 and there is more dark brown spotting when i use the bathroom.    it is stringy and thick, almost stretchy and mucus- like.    i have no cramps or any symptoms that i would normally get before my period.    my cycles are usually around 26 days and i usually spot one day with the full on bleeding the next day.    i did an ept this morning which came back negative.    i know that the chances of me being pregnant are slim, but this bleeding is abnormal for me.    can anyone please describe implantation bleeding in detail?    how long it lasts, how much there should be, the consistency of the blood, any accompanying symptoms... thank you

396,i just did a hiv test and it came out negative but i just had sex 4 weeks ago and i have been having having diarrhea for the last 2 days does that have anything to do with each other and should i still be worried

398,hello doctor.    i am writing this in regards to my husband. about    7 months ago my husband started having testicular pain after he ejaculated. he went to our doctor and they ran a gammit of tests and treated him for hydroceles. after about 10 days or so, the pain ceased and he had no more issues since. now about 2 weeks ago, him and i finished having sex and we noticed that the color of his semen was brown in color. instantly we became concerned, but he was apprehensive and decided to wait a week or two to see if it cleared up on its own. alot of medical online jouranls stated that it could be caused by a variety of non-threatening circumstances and that if it didn'tgo away on its own, then you should seek medical attention. now just yesterday we received his results for a 10-panel drug screen test. we have been in a long drawn-out court battle to gain full custody and he voluntarily submitted to a drug screen. the test came back negative on everything including alcohol, but what was concerning was the level of creatinine that was detected. 175 mg/dl. now everything that i have looked up online states that this is way beyond the normal range. do you believe there is a correlation between all these events? and what do you believe is the actual underlying cause of all of this?thank you.
399,i was last tested in july and tsh was 15.68 (t4 normal). i wasnt told my tsh was high or the symptoms at the time but recently got refered to s neurologist as my vision has been constantly blured and i carry light and shadows.has anyone else experienced constant vision problems with high tsh?
400,hi,i hope that someone may have some insight to these symptoms that i am having. i am a 36 year old female. mother to two small children.about two months ago i started having pain in my left calf. it continued to get worse with no explanation for the pain. i had an ultra sound done to make sure it was not a blood clot. the ultra sound did not show any abnormalities.since then i have been experiencing left leg weakness and strange feelings making me want to move my leg. i also just noticed last week that my calf muscle is starting to become deformed. it does look like it has a deep indentation in it.i also have been having twitching all over my body. the twitches    are really fast little twitches that move around my arms legs and even my    fingers and toes. the other morning i had a very irregular heart beat that lasted about 15 minutes. also, my jaw gets really sore when i chew gum or something hard like a granola bar.i have been to my doctor and just had blood work done today. i am having an x-ray of my leg tomorrow.i have a ppo so i can self refer should i just go to a neurologist instead of my regular doctor?thank you for your time.

405,i'm new to the hep b forum, as i am a hep c'er.    my 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with hep c.. we just got her blood work back. all the counts were fine, alt 23. but there was something i found very curious. she had hep b antibodies, but no virus, meaning she cleared the virus herself. my gp said it was very common in children born and grown up in asia. she was born in indonesia and we left for europe, when she was 8. we never knew she had it, as she had never had any jaundice. i read up a bit on this, and it seems that many children in that part of the world, get infected by playing with each other. the run around outside, fall, bleed, etc. body contact is much more common in indonesia. (i myself am hep b negative, with no antibodies)my question is, do i need to have my other children (17 - 24) also tested for hep b?    nobody is ill with any symptoms. is hep b similar to hep c, where one could be chronically infected without knowing it?my gut feeling tells me, i should get them tested, but my gp (very good, kind and helpful) says it is not necessary, as if they had chronic hep b, they would be quite ill.just fyi,    all the other kids tested hep c negative.thank you before hand for any info on this.marcia
406,my wife's father has ad about a year now. has good days and bad but progressively getting worse. he is now living with her sister and her two kids. the kids are driving him crazy. he says mean and hurtful things and resists moving in with my wife and i. we can't seem to convince him to come with us. and he thinks everyone is out to get him.any suggestions?thanks, bob
407,my friend has a 7 year old little boy and a couple of weeks ago she came to me in tears and said that she woke up with her son prying in her privates and that it seemed that he was trying to put his fingers where a 7 year old shouldnt even know of.. she said that this was the third or fourth time in the last 8 months and that a couple of times she woke up with him humping her like a dog with a full erection. understandably she freaked out. when she asked him why did he do that he simply said i dont know but was scared. when asked if anybody ever touched him inappropriately he looked at her like she was the one with the problem. after a lot of questioning he said that he saw it on tv at the babysitters house who happens to have a couple of teenage boys of the porn watching age. she explained to him that this was very inappropriate    behavior that could get him in a lot of trouble and that it needs to stop. it did for a few months until a couple of weeks ago. why would a 7 year old do that is it a learned behavior i think its weird and abnormal and my friend is worried that this is a sexual predator in the making behavior. she doesnt know what to do. and she is afraid to tell anyone cause she doesnt want to lose her boy or have her and her childs life turned up side down.
408,hi,thank you very much for taking the time to read my question. i am a 37 year old female. have a lymph node on the back of my neck about an inch below the hair line and midway between ear and spine on the right side. i know its a lymph node because i found it early in the spring time by accident...i ended up taking allegra and never found it again...fast foward to late august, i find the bump again!i (and i am not kidding) ran to my pcp to have her look at it. she said it is a lymph node and she wasnt worried about it, she asked if i had any allergies or had a cold. i told her yes...then its gone again...the other day the middle back of my head felt sore, so i had my friend look at it, she says...eeewww...there just a red spot, then a few days later, hubby looks at it...says its a zip and squeezes it!! nice...i wasnt expecting that...anyhoo...a day or two later i notice that the right side of the back of my head is sore...down low near the base of my skull...like someone rubbed it really hard...i do wear a baseball hat almost everyday to keep the sun out of my face. so, my friend looks at that area and says...its a bit flakey...i do not normally have dandruff or anything. so...my husband says to me at 1am...whats that? while rubbing my neck...and sure enough, the lymph node is back...so i panic and then he says...oh, thats always been there...i have a friend who is a neurologist who told me to leave it alone, it'll resolve itself i don't want to seem paranoid...but i am...i am wondering (and i did miss two doses of the allegra before my husband found the bump again) if missing the allegra d and then having what i am assuming is a pimple of some sort could have caused the lymph node to reappear?it is round, sorta pea sized, and isnt really hard, but isnt squishy...doesnt move much...it was this way when doc felt and saw it...also...and i had hubby check too...after taking two more doses of allegra d...it appears to be slightly smaller...and i almost always have post nasal drip when i don't take it...i am completely beside myself with worry...and am afraid i am going to die from this...any idea?thanks!

410,i am a 37 y.o. woman who has gerd my whole life.    recently, i had 2 bouts of severe gastritis, puked up yellow bile after a night of drinking (only a social drinker).    i have eliminated all coffee and soft drinks from my diet and now all alcohol.    my stomach burns so bad around the clock.    i take 1 protonix twice a day and supplement tums when needed.    if i eat, i immediately feel dizzy and bloated.    once i take a tums, i release the gas and start burping up my food (refluxing).    i am wondering if my poor, hunched posture has something to do with it.    i also feel tired all day long.    does emotional stress make gerd worse too?    my husband gets mad at me whenever i talk about feeling sick, which causes more stress on me.    i can't win and don't think i'll ever be able to be well again.

416,alright so about a year and a half to two years ago i was diagnosed with hpv. i still barely know anything about it. i've never had any outbreaks. my doctor said that i had some abnormal cells, they did the biopsy and it came back fine. and i've been going to the doctor for 6 months ever since then, and my tests have always came back normal he said. i've only had an abnormal pap smear about two years ago when i first found out...so, what exactly does that mean??? i don't see how they say i have hpv, yet.. my tests always come back normal?..so now my other questions is about giving it to other people. the last guy i had sex with i used a condom with, he fingered me, he wanted to perform oral sex on me but i said no.can a guy give me oral sex and not get anything? (remember i don't have outbreaks)i've heard so many different stories about this and giving it to people, and i'm really nervous.what is the chances of me giving it to someone else by sex and by oral sex? i know he can't get it from fingering.please please any information would help! :(

418,i am a 30 yr old women sexually active with one partner.    last month i had a terrible attack of a urinary track infection.    i've only had one once before 10 yrs ago and never had one again until now. after taking myself to immediate care where i was given a urinalysis test, i was prescribed cipro 2x a day for three days.    after the 3 days of antibiotic, i noticed i still had a slight    discomfort.    a week later it was slowly getting more uncomfortable.    i went back to the doctors where they took another urinalysis and sure enough i still had a bladder infection.    i was then prescribed macrobid 2x a day for 7 days.    after the wk of the macrobid antibiotics, i felt an ever so slight, tad bit discomfort. still urinating frequently and some pressure down in my lower abdomen.    i then researched that i could purchase an over the counter uti test strips to see if i still had an infection. (i just couldn't believe that after all the antibiotics i had why was i still feeling discomfort?). i took the at home test strip and sadly so i tested positive in leukocytes and negative in the nitrite. now for the 3rd time i went back to the drs. feeling depressed that i was still dealing with this. i was prescribed cephalexin, 4x a day for 7 days.    it is now 1 wk later, i just took another at home uti test strip, and again it is showing positive for leukocytes.    what should be my next step? should i set up an apt with a urinologist? a friend of mine told me i might have interstitial cystitis. i have done some research but i'm not sure what to do.    i've never been to the drs so much in my entire life.    i am very active and health, so this is out of my comfort zone.    also, during this bladder infection time i have visited my gynecologist.    i am clean of stds. and even had an ultra sound that read positive.    no signs of any alarm.    i don't know what to do next?    i just want this discomfort to be over with. i do not have insurance so i am a cash patient.what do i do now???

424,i am 22 years old. have been sexually active for about 8 years or so. yes, i started young, not too proud of it. i had quite a few partners in the 8 years i have been having sex. i have had and treated chlamydia twice. my concerns are: a weird smell coming from vaginal area, clumps of discharge sometimes a lot sometimes a little bit to none and is of a white or yellowish color and kinda like yogurt texture, this is embarrassing, also every once in a while it itches really bad and usually after itching becomes raw and inflammed and burns when i pee. i dont itch until it is raw just a lil scratch here and there. i have tried topical creams, from betamethasone to vagisil and monistat, and i have tried antibacterial soaps and keeping the area dry and    clean. i am not a dirty person and i have had only one partner in 2 years. the smell and discharge are wat worry me the most. i went to the hospital for excruciating stomache pains and got a pap smear and other std tests and they all came back negative. i am worried that the test may have been done wrong or there wasnt enough there to register on the test and i dont want to pass anything to my partner. im thinking it is just a bacterial infection of some sort and strong antibiotics will help. im just looking for some advice on my next step before i go to the doc. help!!
425,i have been taking about 40mg of roxicet for 2 years due to hip pain. my doc recently advised me that i need to get off of the roxicet and gave me some clonidine and ativan to help with the withdrawals. will these two drugs actually help or do i need to go to a detox center?
426,first time i had a fib it was in year 2000. i had been eating spicy food and red chillies raw with food. i was put on comudain and since then i had about 3/4 episodes again. every time either i had eaten heavy cheese and spices or simply spicy indian food. my last episode still existing got triggered by a meal in a restraunt and the food was supposed to mild spicy and it came i think made of 100% red chillies only. i ate about 6 spoons and it damaged my stomach lining and the a fib started. i normally take metapronol to lower the heart rate and not move around so much and the first day is the hardest. i sip milk, eat plain yougurt, eat only steamed vegetables, rice and meals with only salt and no spices. ice cream also helps to coat the stomach. not sure if comudain has made the stomach lining more sensitve over 8 years use.i have lvh - left venrical hypertrophy with high bp which is controlled by lopressor, rythmol(afib), comudain, vasotec(bp) and lipitor.does anyone know if lipitor also irritates the stomach. i have been on it for 2 years and am thinking of dropping it. my cholestrol is at border line. my problem is not much excercise due busy life schedule to earn a living most of the time and then resting to gather the energy.in my view the vagal nerve connected from stomach to heart is responsible for triggering afib when either too spicy food is eaten or extreme acid reflux (gerd) and    triggered from a nerve from oesphugus when too much food is gulped down at a fast rate. both nerves are connected to heart.doctors openly will not admit to it and my cardioligist does not either. we should write our experiances here so that the medical community does start to research this area and stop feeding comudian to us which was really discovered and made for rat poision to bleed the rats to death in wwii time.i am no doctor but my body tells me and i need to listen to that. my doc had swtiched me from rythmol to amiodrone which had huges side effects. my hands skin started to get dark in sun and while sleeping it would feel like there were bricks on my chest. well i switched back and told me doc i rather die than take amiodrone. for me it worked, i had to change my eating habits. since i travel 10 months a year it is hard and some time you just end up eating something that is not right. i usually stop and send the food back but you do not need much to damage the stomach specially if it is hot mexican food etc.i will be going on boiled and steamed vegs and simple monk food and try to get off some of these meds. would appreciate comments on lipitor.
427,hi,my daughter has an appointment at the hospital on monday and i am wondering what to expect.    she is going because her lymph nodes have been swollen for 7 months in her head and neck.    last wednesday i took her in to the doctor and he said now all her lymph nodes are swollen...not only in the head adn neck, but armpits, groin and abdomen.    she has also started having nose bleeds which started around the same time the lymph nodes were noticed.    what are some less serious things that this could be?    do the lymph nodes usually stay swollen for this long with a virus?    any input?    thanks
428,i am a 16 year old female, and for the past few months, i've been having odd symptyoms...about ten months ago, i got these bumps in the very back of my throat. when i went to the doctor, he said they were swollen lymph nodes, and to expect the to go away within a few weeks. however, i still have them, and now i'm beginning to get white spots on them.around a month ago, i began getting these wierd fevers.. i'll have a normal temperature, but the all of a sudden, i will develop a really high fever. it would get higher and higher until i broke a sweat, and then it would quickly go away. this happens in less than five minutes, and it's been getting more frequent.i've also been getting abnormally thirsty. i feel like i always need to be drinking, even when my stomach feels like it's about to explode. it's gotten to the point where my mom, who's a nurse, had to tell me to quit drinking water because i've been consuming it in unhealthy amounts. but i have this insatiable thirst, and if i don't drink, it feels like i can't breathe and i get dizzy and too hot.i'm definitely not pregnant or diabetic, and i eat normally. i haven't begun taking any new medications recently.i don't know what would cause this, but please help if you know anything.
429,http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/11/tech/sea-orbiter/index.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seaorbiterthe seaorbiter, also known as sea orbiter (two words), is an ocean going research vessel set for launch in 2013. similar to a space ship, the seaorbiter is planned to allow scientists and others a residential yet mobile research station positioned under the oceans' surface. the station will have laboratories, workshops, living quarters and a pressurized deck to support divers and submarines.[1][2][3]seaorbiter is a project of the floating oceanographic laboratory organisation. it is headed by french architect jacques rougerie, oceanographer jacques piccard and astronaut jean-loup chretien. the construction of the oceanographic laboratory started in 2011. the cost is expected to be around $52.7 millionthe laboratory is semi-submersible ocean going craft and weighs 1000 tons. it has a total height of 51 meters with 31 meters below sea level.it is designed to float vertically and drift with the ocean currents but has two small propellers allowing it to modify its trajectory and maneuver in confined waters. underwater robots can be sent from the laboratory to explore the seabed. the hull is made     of an alloy comprising aluminum and magnesium is five times thicker than that of a conventional vessel.its vertical alignment in the sea will leave a small part visible above the surface with much larger accommodation and laboratories below the sea's surface. some levels will have a cabin pressure equal to the external water pressure allowing divers to live for extended periods at depth and make frequent excursions.
430,i was diagnosed with a benign thyroid nodule that is either 2.8 or 3.8 in size. it is ovular. originally the doctor had said that it was 2.8 but today rechecked the test results and said 3.8. with 2.8 and benign, it doesn't need removal. if 3.8, it's strongly recommended. my blood test results were normal. aside from finding out what the reading is, because the doctor won't admit he said 2.8 originally and it hasn't grown in a week (he said today that it hadn't and the numbers are the same. still suspicious why he kept saying 2.8 the last time. not just once and had the test results themselves in front of him), i'm wonding if i should just go ahead with the sugery. or if there are alternatives to zap the nodule so its no longer an issue. i'm 32 years old, female, and in relatively good health. there is no family history of this and i'm confused and worried.
431,i have lil white small bumbs on the lips of my vigina(vagina)and i just want to kno is it normal?
432,hi,i had a sexual encounter with a professional on october 30, 2010. i wore a condom throughout the act and i dont think the condom broke. i had vaginal sex with her but it was for just about a minute. i did tests for hiv, hepb and hep c at 4, 5, 7 and 10 weeks. all came negative. the problem is during a routine test on november 22 i dounf my sgot/sgpt high @ 40/80 respectiverly. i went to my doc and after 3 weeks mild medication checked level again. sgot/sgpt levels were 52/90. i am again on mild medication till jan 19 which is when i am visiting doc again. but due to my anxiety i retested for sgpt/sgot and hiv/hep b (hbsag) and/hep c (hcv antibody) on jan 7. hiv, hep b and hep c were all negative but my sgpt level had risen to 110. sgot was back down to 39. i am extremely scared and anxious about this. my quesion was that, can hepeatitis tests be negative if the sgpt is high @ 110. as in this means that my sgps is hig because of reasons other than hepatitis.
433,ok- so i went to my gp on 1/28 with two issues after returning from a business trip. both turned out to be trouble.1) i had fallen down on ice- and my thumb was injured2) i had a badly swollen lymph node in my neck.he prescribed augmentin and made an appointment for me with a hand specialist. i started    taking augmentin on 1/29. went to the hand specialist on 2/3/09. the hand specialist confirmed i had torn my ligament and needed surgery asap since the injury can only be repaired if it is done expediantly. as customary i guess, a cbc is performed before surgery and was done on 2/4/09. the white count showed an elevated count of 13,000. surgeon wont perform elective surgery with an elevated white count. so i take a follow-up, and the count is 17,000 the next day on 2/5. now i am in limbo with my thumb and concerned about my health. my gp makes an appointment with a hematologist the next day (2/6) and it shows 18,000. he draws about 6 viles of blood for what seems like a complete blood analysis that in large part wont have results returned until this thursday. so i go online, and i read about white counts and fears of leukemia or stds emerge in my mind. i have no outtward signs of infection including the lymph node going down to normal and the hospital did some additional blood tests that showed no confirmed infections in my system. what's more, a chest xray ordered by my gp was negative (i am a smoker) today i do feel kinda weak and like something is wrong.    so i am left worried i have something really serious and i cant fix my thumb until i confirm no infection or my white count declines. i am so scared right now!!! help!!!
434,i posted a question about a week ago. got email back to say i got 5 answers back but cant find them im new to this can someone help please. thankyou
435,my 16 year old daughter needs a diagnosis. at the age of    9 she had a severe kidney infection that required i.v. antibiotics, (her fever got up to 105.1). at 12 she had a uti. at thirteen she had several uti's and was sent to a urologist. she was told her urine was clean and that if she had one more to come back. several months went by with no problems. at 14, in a matter of hours she developed another uti that included vomitting and fever. just a few months after that she got another one, a few months later she began getting the symptoms of a uti with urine tests and cultures coming back negative. we took her to another urologist who began to treat her for ic. after about a month on an antihistimine she had an attack of pain in her back, in the area of her kidneys. sometimes both sides, sometimes one more than the other. during one of these severe episodes that occured after hours i was told by another doctor in the same practice that he had never heard of a 16 year old with ic, and that the pain in her back didn't make any sense because both sides were hurting. we then    met with the head doctor in the same practice who insinuated that she was maybe looking for attention. from there we went to a pediatriac urologist. the nurse practioner sent her for a sonogram and a vcug. we were told to make sure the vcug was done with cycling, that she was sure she had vur, that even with the cycling it would be hard to detect. the sonogram looked great. the vcug was not done with the cycling due to a lab error. but we were reassured that the test looked perfectly normal and that they didn't think she could have vur. during all of this my daughter had developed severe fatigue. at first we thought it was the antibiotics she was taking. a high dose of macrodantin followed by a preventive dose. that was changed to bactrim with a little improvement.the urologist said he saw nothing wrong with her and suggested she see an immunologist. we are baffeled. she has spuratic bouts of burning during and after urination, and pain in her kidneys, and the fatigue is still there. she is about to start her cheerleading season and won't be able to with all of this going on. she says her muscles feel very weak. please help me figure out what to do next. another urologist? an immunologist? any help you can give us?

437,hi! my question is about excessive body hair and its relation to fertility.i would not say i have too much of body hair but i have growth(though medium growth) at locations such as chin,around nipples and around the navel.i would not call that the hair is very thick or coarse but i have to remove it by threading every 15 days or so.i dont know if this could be called as hirsutism bcoz i do not suffer from pcos or anything.my body weight is perfect and i have regular cycles.i have been ttc for nearly 9 months without success.all our reports are normal.i read somewhere that this hair growth is due to the prodution of excessive male hormone testosterone.i was just wondering if there could be any relation between this hair growth and fertility.
438,i freeze breastmilk for future use. i was reading when you defrost the bags, you can defrost in the fridge overnight or run it under warm tap water. now if i defrost on the fridge, can i still warm it up with boiled water? when i heat up milk that has been in the fridge, (not previously frozen) i usually boil water in a pot then take it off the stove and let the container sit in it until warm. can i heat defrosted milk the same way? thanks! i couldn't find any info in my breastpump manual.

440,hi, i have just received my labs from my pcp that show that my tsh is 0.022, t4 2.5, thyroid peroxidase <10, triiodothyronine, free, serum 1.5. is this suggestive of a pituitary issue as opposed to a throid issue?i am feeling extreme fatigue unlike i've ever felt in the 14 years since they diagnosed me with hypothyroidism. dizziness, no headaches or visual disturbances. i have been referred to an endocrinologist but cannot get in for another 2 months. i've asked that my appointment be moved up because i do feel so badly but to no avail. also, my total cholesterol is 240 and my ldl is 150!!!any advice would be helpful.thanks,vennboys
441,day 1: recently right after i showered, i felt some dry discomfort on my the end of my labia minora so i applied some clotrimazole that the doctor gave me the last time i had an infection. but then when i went to use the restroom a couple times and pass a movement, i pushed to get the bowel movement and when i did that i felt the discomfort extending throughout one side of my vuvlva, the right side of my labia majora and outside my labia minora. i just ignored it though.day 2: this day i went to school and felt that the discomfort got worse and although i still retained that dry discomfort, there was also    a stinging pain that would occur every now and then when ever i moved, accompanied with that it felt like my vulva had on the right side had been stretched or something along those lines so it burned as well. so i still applied the clotrimazole cream as directed.day 3: normally this starts getting better by now but to me it began to feel more irritated and hurt worse. the pain on day 2 was subtle and still bearable, in fact the cream had kind of a soothing affect when applied but when i wiped it off after using the restroom or after it wore off hours later the pain cam back. anyway on the third day when i moved a certain way the pain would become really intense, so much to the point that i thought i had some kind of long cut down there. so i took a mirror and checked it out but didnt find a sign of a cut and i wasnt bleeding.day 4: im getting worried today that i might have something other than a yeast infection because to my knowledge, such an infection schouldnt feel like someone cut me down there. or it could simply be because of the stress i applied on the first day, nonetheless im worried.my concerns and notes: first of all, im doubting its any form of std cause ive never had sex, still a virgin, and dont have a boyfriend    and i havent done anything sexual either. im not sure if the cream is helping or hurting the problem because it should have healed some by now.some advice from a medical professional would be much appreciated. advice from anyone else unless theyve gone through this, im going to ignore.
442,for a few years now i have had pain just underneath my penis on the bottom of the shaft, from what i can feel while i urinate there is a vein of some kind that controls the urine flow. now this painful urination is sometimes on/off again but mostly every time for the past 5 years. i have seen my doctor that specializes in this area and i am clean. no std's or infections. now while i have been living with this pain i have tried to pin pinpoint the exact area in which it occurs. each time i use the bathroom to pee; it is always in the same area, on the underside of the penis and always in the same spot.. i have tried to stand in different ways to let the urine flow properly, and have tried to ease the urine out by lightly squeezing but to no avail.    as i stated before i have been cleared on all counts of std's.    now i am wondering if it may be the vein itself? could it have possibly closed up on me causing the pain each time? because that is exactly what it feels like. i have tried flomax in a very small dose about 10lm over the past 3 weeks and still that did not help. one thing i have done was gong to the doctor and having them use a catheter (with a camera) to run down the inside of my penis to see if there were any obstructions. and after that session i was able to pee freely for about a day or so. however the pain returned and i had to use a catheter on my self for a week(much more painful to do when you pull it back out of your penis..)    any suggestions or    ideas?

444,my son's age is 3yr 4months.we tested his ears and doctors told that there is no hearing problem.he responds only if he wish to otherwise not always though he listens.if we say chocolate he immediately responds even if he watches tv.he listens and turn up even for a small sound like train noise, plane, calling bell (he likes trains, planes etc) and responds immediately but if we call he doesn't respond most of the times immediately.we think that he doesnt understand what we r saying.he just remembers few words that we use and does things without understanding. also,we think he lives only in present tense but cannot recollect about past.for ex, if he goes to school and comes back and we ask where have u been and what have u done there he doesnt understand what we say.he doesnt understand the question.if i ask his brother(younger 1 year old)    name sometimes he says but sometimes he repeats the question and sometimes just say brother. that means he doesnt understand. he asks for water, if he feel hungry he asks for chocolate, biscuit ,chips etc but not food.he    can say that he wants to go to toilet and he goes    himself.he watches tv and laptop for hours. he asks for the particular rhymes or song by pointing out with finger and says first word. he can say numbers 1-10 and a-z as well as identify them. he can tell rhymes and sing songs.he can say colors. he plays with his brother. he loves his brother.he kisses him. we are worrying about him a lot. please suggest us to improve him

447,i have been origionally diagnosed as add then adhd then bipolar then manic depressive then bpd and of course many other pill and diagnoses to fix me. nothing has worked beyond the meds making me detached even more so or sleepy to the point i dont get out of bed. but my question is being that i have been searching to see about this issue that all the doctors ignore that i always tell them about.when watch a person talk and hear them along with other noises i seem to repeat so to say. my vision in my head not at the visual level kind of flickers up and back up then back. and the sounds dont align i hear all the words and music and stuff in my head are what seems to be compeating for a bandwidth. like watching a streaming video ment for cable on a dialup line. is this still apart of bpd because i have yet to hear or find this explained and yet the doctors bypass it like i make it up.    and now because no meds work i seem to have backed myself back to being broke, jobless and with a company to run that i dont know if it will.     help please. maybee at lease i can know more about my plroblem. to move over it and work past it.

450,me and my boyfriend recently had unprotected sex. we had sex on monday and i was supposed to start my period on wednesday, but    never did. its now monday of the next week. and i still have nothing. i've spotted a few times, but its nothing big. i wanna know if i could be pregnant. when can i take a test??? help!!!
451,a friend of mine just called me up and told me she started her period but that it is orange, as orange as an orange.    has anyone ever heard of anything like this?     she also has blood in her urine which has occured for sometime now and waiting to see a specialist about could there be any relation to these two symptoms?    seems very odd to me.
452,hi,i was diagnosed with gerd almost 15 years ago and i've had maybe two or three flareups over the years. i'm going in for an endoscopy next week and have been stressing a bit about barrett's esophagus (cuz that's what i do).the things that's always seemed strange to me is that i really don't get heartburn. i just have a burning stomach that's kinda there all the time during my flare ups, but most of the time only comes on after i've had too much coffee or some other thing i shouldn't be doing.also, when i get reflux, which is almost every time i eat regardless of flareups, it's not the common acidic/bitter taste that most people talk about. it's basically just the food that i've just eaten coming up. it doesn't burn.so those two things always seemed strange to me. no heartburn (which i understand is no too uncommon), and the non-burning, non-bitter, reflux.since barrett's is associated with acid coming up, i wonder if that's a big danger given my symptoms?any thoughts?thanks so much in advance,michael
453,i have been using opiods for many years.    i just took a pregnancy test that turn out positive.    i haven't seen a doctor yet (i took the test at 10pm friday night dec. 21st) because it's christmas.    i assume i'm only between 4-6 weeks pregnant.    if i just stop taking opiates cold turkey would that be dangerous for my baby?    would that put me more at risk for a miscarriage?

457,i am a 24 year old male and had protected sexual intercourse with a female 5 weeks ago. the day after my testicles turned red.over the last five weeks my penis opening has swelled my penis shaft is swollen and hard and last my anal cavity swelled. it seems to be going away now but i cant tell if its the antibiotics or a primary herpes mild reaction subsiding. i have tested negative for herpes 1 and 2. then i tested positive for 1. then negative again for both.    over the last 5 weeks my doctor has told me that i have a yeast infection(changed his mind) then epididymitis with levaquin as my treatment. ive been on it for about a month now. anybody have any ideas because im exhausted and frustrated.
458,went to chiropractor who was substituting for original chiro, young person who was not experienced, read my chart, went ahead and treated me by pressing on my upper back, something popped on my breastbone area, sternum, now have pain, he acknowledged he heard a pop    when i breathe deeply it hurts and the area between my breast has been painful for 5 days now, i went to see original chiro following monday told him what happened he said the chiro was not suppose to press on my upper back because i had vertebioplasty for fractured spine, he told me i could sue or he could help me with treatments for free to get the problem fixed?????    what are my recourses take the treatment or sue for bad judgment on part of sub chiro who obviously was not trained properly in treatment of patient with my condition, he read my chart but failed to recognize the condition of my spine.    also can chiro treatment fix what just happened to me and do i need an xray to find out if he damaged my vertibioplasty that was done for my fracture, is this going to be a life threatening or disability situation????
459,i have high risk hpv/herpes.    i had the leep done in feb this yr for precancerous cells that was shown on the copo done before the procedure.    after the leep, the tissue that was removed showed no dysplasia only inflammation.    i had a recheck pap and copo in june and that showed mild dysplasia.    so we just watched it and now in sept did a pap and copo and have moderate cin2.    should i do the leep again?    does it pay to keep on doing the leep, than wait till the cells get worse, than do it again?    is this going to keep on occuring with the high risk hpv?    it doesnt seem to resolve and it seems like it just gets worse as we wait.    is this normal with this highrisk hpv, or does this not seem right? i am scared if we miss something it will turn into cancer.    does mine seem more agressive than others?please give me yall input, it means alot!!!thanks
460,i have been dealing with a condition for what seems to be like 6 or 7 years now.    it only occurs maybe once or twice every couple of months at night when i am drinking.    i get this very uncomfortable feeling in the tip of my penis.    it is not pain, but it's just extremely annoying and uncomfortable.    it does not hurt when i urinate, have sex, ejaculate, etc..    over the last year or 2 i have noticed that taking ibuprofen when the discomfort starts does tend to help.    i feel that it usually occurs when i drink lots of beer with limes so i also think it has something to do with the citric acid, but then again i drink lemonade and things like that all the time without alcohol and feel nothing.    i have had std tests and all came up negative.    i also try and drink cranberry juice when this occurs and sometimes it helps.    last night i had 4 or 5 drinks and one drink was a beer with lemons.    i have no idea if that is a coincidence, but the same discomfort took place.    however, this time it increased to burning when i urinated and ongoing pain for 2 hours.    i also felt the urge to urinate many times throughout the night.    the more i urinated the less pain i felt.    i have had numerous sexual partners, but only one over the last 6 months or so.    i just can't figure out if this is some kind of allergic reaction, something wrong with my bladder or prostate, or possibly some kind of std??
461,i had c5 - 7 removed with cage and plating. this was done on 10/27/10. i am almost 6 weeks post op and have burning up the left side of my neck. prior to the surgery the numbness was on the right side and the head aches were unbelievable. the head aches and right side numbness is totally gone. i've read that the burning is common and will disappear. my new problem is i can't wear anything close to my neck. it feels like there is something pressing against my throat. my ns is very cautious. i am still in the hard collar 50% of the day and at night when i sleep. i wear a bone growth stimulator 24/7 for 6 months. does anyone else have this problem with there throat?

463,lately i've been having spells that come on at no certain time and last for a minute or up to a few minutes. i feel my head getting hot, start to sweat then get a spaced out feeling like i'm looking through binoculars or everything seems far away. then i get nervous or shaky. i've never had this before and wonder if they are panic attacks. i've had my heart checked several times by different drs and they all tell me my heart is fine.my first thought was my ears because they are always ringing really loud and my balance is off sometimes. i also feel stuffed up. but i don't understand what the sweating and hot flash to the head is and why i feel spaced out or why it comes on so sudden.does this sound like panic attacks? i'm going to check with my dr but i was wondering if this sounds like this. do panic attacks come on all of a sudden and what causes them?
464,if i had a protected sex with a prostitute, then it would be safe for me, i know that.but my problem was that the moment i took off the condom, the condom touched my penis directly. then was i still safe? because there are almost fresh fluid on its surface.
465,could the finding of a cerebrovascular anomaly in the left posterior cerebral artery of suspected congenital origin cause me problems later in life?    i have had several ct scans before and none mentioned this until now and it is supposed to be from infancy.    i don't understand.    if it was missed all this time (i am 50), could it be part of the reason i am having severe dizzy spells (i have had them on and off throughout my life), nausea, shortness of breath and severe short term memory loss?    could it put me at higher risk of aneurysm or stroke or is this something that is just there and will never cause a problem?
466,i recently got tested and everything came back normally except hsv 1 & 2 - i knew i had 1 because i get coldsores and have since i was a child. but i'm confused about hsv 2.the results sayhsv 2 igg 1.97 indexthe anthoner one say hsv 2 igg 3.31 index& hsv 2 igg 3.30 indexthen hsv 2 igm inderictand t pallidum antibodies negativewhat does that all mean ?ive never noticed anything having to do with genital herpes and the doctor didnt explain anything well at all. helpp !

468,hi, i've recently had more intense lower spine issues which resulted initially in my being admitted to my local hospital er for cauda equina syndrome checks as i'm also suffering with constipation.    i spent 24 hours in the hospital to be told i wasn't constipated despite having only passed an amount a rabbit would have been ashamed of once a week for a period of twelve weeks.    i was told i'd receive an appointment for an mri and was sent on my way.    i went for the first mri which was an lumbar spine series and was called back 3 days later for further scans and with contrast (gadolinium).    following these i've had the results back and have an l5-s1 herniation, as well as a 4mm cauda equina tumor, presumed to be a neuroma.i've been trying to google and find out what 4mm actually relates to within the cauda equina to no avail.    i've been referred to a neurosurgeon, and am curious to know what if any treatment would be invoved with this neuroma if anyone at all knows.    i should add the neuroma is at the l4 region.thanks in advance

470,i received my first depo provera shot in jan. 2012 and then my second in april. 2012. i was scheduled for my third one in july but didn't end up getting it because, when i asked my doctor about possibly switching birth control she tried to tell me that i just needed to do what she said and not worry. the thing is thought that i never told her i was worried about anything and she seemed a little odd about it to me. i was worried however because i was told that i would still have my periods and then i didn't have any at all. the entire reason for me starting depo was to regulate my periods not end them. it has been 8 months since getting off of depo and i am just now starting to have some discharge. it is a disgusting dark brown with some pinkish blood in it. i was worried that it might be an early sign of pregnancy. but after reading all of the other women's posts i realize that it has nothing to do with pregnancy. i really hope that this discharge doesn't stick around for as long as yours and also hasn't effected my fertility because, i am really trying to conceive. so i guess my true question is has any one had issues with becoming pregnant and or being able to carry a child at all after being on depo? i would really appreciate some answers please? thank you very much in advance.

477,dr called last night,said i have tested positive for hcv.where i had asked for liver enzyme test,he said there is hope that i may not    need treatment where my body has been attacking the virus on its on.there's no liver damage-all liver enzymes are in the normal range.the low grade fever is just a symptom of liver fighting hcv in its own way.he said 1 out of 5 ppl. are like this.i have to go back today and today's bloodwork will show what genotype plus if i am one of the ppl that doesnt have to do any treatment.he says there's a strong possibility where there's not been any symptoms besides low-grade fever and the extremely long time frame since being exposed.pray,pray,pray,i cannot afford financially to miss not 1 day of work.this financial crunch is what is worrying me so bad.restaurant i work for doesnt carry any insurance and i have friends that have tried to get either short-term or long term disability due to cancer and one is now dead,other was able to get medicaid but not any kind of disability(she had kidney cancer and they removed kidney)but she's unable to work so she's basically living on other ppl's charity) and food stamps but no kind of financial help at all.also how bad is treatment?are others able to function @ their jobs?thx
478,hello went to see my endo yesterday who has scheduled me in for a fna biopsy today. he explained about the process and how it works and success rates etc. however what i was hoping for was a solution to why i feel so ill all the time, because my blood levels are normal he was unable yo give me anything for the symptoms i've been experiencing (extreme tiredness, pains in neck, swollen lymph gland, flare up of arthritis in neck and shoulders, generally feel like i'm in a fog all the time,, lack of energy etc)his explanation was because of the lump in the thyroid this can cause inflamation(inflammation)which then    affects the immune system hence the swollen lymph glands etc, he said it's a bit like having glandular fever and like gf will therefore    have to run it's course. the thought of feeling this unwell for god knows how long is very depressing. i'm due back at work on monday (i'm a teacher) and just can't face it.any thoughts?v

482,i am a breast cancer survivor of 2 years and have been taking tamoxifen @20 mg per day for the last 1 1/2 years. i started getting my cycles again monthly starting 6 months ago. with very heavy bleeding and very large blood clots. i have severe pelvic pain about 1 week before my cycle, that is not cramping. i saw my obgyn this week, and have a transvaginal ultrasound scheduled for next week. is this normal while taking tamoxifen, or do these look like symptoms of something else?
483,just wondering if anyone has worn an inflatoball pessary?    it is a pessary that you insert and then inflate.    i was just fitted for one and found it to be very comfortable.    can not shift around like the ring.    i tried the ring pessary, but i had too much rectal pressure with it.    the down side with the inflatoball pessary is that i will have to clean it more often than the ring, but it is easy to put in and take out.    don't want surgey.    i have had a uterus prolapse for 30 years and was never told about the pessary.    found out about it when i started to research having the surgery. anyway, just wondered if anyone else had long term experience with the inflatoball pessary?thanks,kw1949

486,i suffer from skipped heart beats and have for about 3 years. last year i underwent an echocardiogram, a stress test, mri and a cardiac catheter. all came out good but i after all tests i was put on blood pressure medicine.    i have asthma and panic attacks on top of the high blood pressure.    i didn't have the skipped beats for about 4 months (or they were just so mild i didnt notice them) but then i got strep throat in march and they came back.    it is now june and there are times when my life has to stop because of them.    i get short of breath, have chest pains but usually they go away after i sleep overnight.    the next day, usually towards the end of the day, they come back again. i recently
487,hey,i have been reading and some posting since i had my ep on the 3rd of sept. i was 8 weeks gone. i had to have my right tube removed along with the pregnancy. recovery has been kind in that my stitches have healed well, no major pains other than ovulation-type pains on both sides which i can control with painkillers. slowly i have gained my energy back and ready to go back to work on monday. i dont feel any particular emotional loss to the ep, other than saddened it had to happen. i am keep to start trying again and as such have become 'addicted' to sites such as this with uplifting success storied from other ladies. i have not bleed other than two days of very light spotting post surgery so am waiting for af to arrive.the thing is i am just fed up! :twisted: :twisted: :twisted: does anyone else feel this way? i have spent the past three weeks trying to figure out what could have caused the ep. i have had a chlamydia test done and am awaiting results. i have thought back to the past year to locate any pelvic discomfort or pain as a reason. i guess i am trying to figure out not only what caused it but how i can prevent it. patience is not something i have much of so waiting 3 months is driving me insane. i am hoping work will help distract my counting the days :)the things is- i feel as if i am so alone (though i am not alone at all). as if there is no-one who really understands or cares enough to ask. my husband seems to be carrying on as normal.i have read many womens partners and husbands have done the same- that it is their way of coping.i feel as if he is being rather inconsiderate of what i have gone through- his lack of knowledge/ignorance of the procedure or my recovery-his ability to think i can be ok-to think his about his work as so important. he has even gone so far as to make comments about my recovery as if i am faking or exaggerating it. he made out his comment was a joke -am i being too sensitive? he made some statement the other night how his work is going to be stressful and be the death of him and i needed to be considerate and give him the time he needs. i feel that is all i have given him with our whole marriage. to cut that story short- i have been the one that has got the ball rolling on the engagement and wedding (17/4/9) of which i am still waiting on the honeymoon. we had planned to start ttc after our honeymoon but it [honeymoon] never happened because of his work or something. then we fell pregnant and then the ep. so now i asked him to get the honeymoon sorted as it would be a nice break for us and he has done nothing. to boot he has now told me he has alot of stress' at work. am i being rather insensitive about his stress at work? with all the engagement/wedding/honeymoon saga over the past year i have asked myself if he is right for me and now this ep is making me ask it again. i know you guys can not answer for me but i wonder if anyone else had these thoughts. i feel as if i had to go through and do it all and he gets away with nothing- carrying on with life as if nothing has happened. it's not as if these thoughts have come later on either. i started feeling them soon after my ep was removed.it is all so confusing as i am aware i could be focusing all my ep emotions onto him and taking it out on him. does it sound like i am doing that?i am hoping sitting at home has exacerbated all my thoughts and going back to work will do me the world of good. the one thing we are both agreeing on is ttc as soon as we can. i have had conflicting advice on whent o start but am waiting to see how af is when she arrives. i have not had a bad recovery post op so i hope she will be kind this time...thanks for thaking the time to read.. i know it is a bit self pitiful but i have been brewing about it for almost three weeks :?minimin
488,my daughter was a vibrant teenager.    she was very athletic and was into competitive cheer leading, soccer, track and was an honor roll student her entire life.    the only problem she has ever had was heavy periods, but so did i at her age. i took her to a doctor to see if bc pills would control her heavy flow and she suggested the gardasil vaccine.    i told her that i had not researched it and she laughed, saying it was very safe.    my daughter has always been sensitive to drugs, but never a vaccine, so i agreed.     within 20 minutes she was so sick with extreme fatigue, dizziness, blackouts, numbness, high fever, body aches, migrain headaches, vomiting and diarrhea.    this degree of reaction lasted for four days.    the doctor assured me that it was not possible that the vaccine could be the cause.    but then i searched the side effects.    i was horrified to learn that thousands have had the same reaction, and worse!    my daughter is on the injuries continued page of truthaboutgardasil.org and her name is ashlee smith.    for 9 months now, she continues to vomit every day, every test imaginable shows that she is normal.    she continues to have headaches, dizziness, fatigue and her life has changed dramatically.    she is now in counseling to deal with the depression and anger.    i don't know if this will go on the ask the doc forum, i couldn't figure out how to post a question there.    i can't help my daughter and it's killing me!    if you have had this same problem and found a way to help it, please contact me!    thank you!
489,i realize that different neurologists can see different things on a brain mri, but it's driving me crazy!i have a confirmed thoracic spine lesion.    x, my old neurologist who diagnosed me with ms, saw two brain lesions in my corpus callosum 3 years ago (where the radiologist saw nothing) and now y, a different neurologist, says that he doesn't see them on that mri film or the repeat that i had 2 years ago.    the one i had last year the radiologist read as normal, but y says that i could have a t2 bright lesion in the anterior corpus callosum and a t2 dark lesion in the posterior corpus callosum, but he says that they're very subtle and could be artifact.y seems to make a big deal that i have no dawson's fingers or subcortical lesions.    he feels that i should have lesions if i've had ms since the 1990s or possibly longer (i had a brachial plexitis in 1984 (resolved), and had funky feelings down my left side of my body after a car accident in 1994).    didn't have transverse myelitis until 2003.    i've had exacerbated symptoms with bronchitis and stress but also have had increased symptoms in the absence of stress or infection that i never reported to my neurologist.    so according to y, i've had no episodes of focal neurological deficit in [my] life.    try telling that to my body when i'm tripping over non-existent things or getting nauseous within 2 seconds of looking at a computer screen (and not other things) or when i can't remember the word i want to use and have to pick something else to use (or slur my words slightly).ok, can brain lesions disappear over time?    if i had a repeat brain mri soon (not likely) and those possibly artifactual lesions are still there, wouldn't that indicate that they weren't artifact?what causes artifact besides movement?    i held still the entire brain mri.
490,last may or april my girlfriend got pregnant. during a routine exam she was told she had gonerrea. she tried to put the blame on me. i got test for all stds a day or two later and came back negative. she then confessed that she cheated. my question , is it possible that i simply dodged the bullet and the gonorrea did not develop inside me? i remember having unprotected sex around the time she got pregnant and after not knowing she had an std. question two is it possible our child is mine even though the timespan when she got the std and pregnant is so close? mind you i just got tested two weeks ago again and i am still std free.
491,well how are all the hang over's.hope you all had a pint of the black stuff on paddy's day.the parade here in ireland was fab great weather what more could we ask 4 ( o ya no such thing as a thyoid's ) xx
492,well after waiting for 6 hours today at the re office (we went out to lunch and then went back), i am not pregnant!!blah. . . so instead of moving onto injectables/iui, i am just going for ivf. i complained about the price, and got the re to agree to give me $1000 worth of meds free and he is going to give me a %20 discount since i am in the medical field as well (rn). so when my period starts i will do month of birth control and then onto ivf in june. i am really hopeful that it will work. it's my last try for now. i guess the line i saw yesterday must have been evap line. well better luck to all you ladies doing iui! and anyone who is going through ivf or had success, i hope to be in the same boat. :) baby dust to all.
493,hi,12 days ago, i had unprotected sex with an 18 year old girl. i have a history of hypochondria, and so began checking myself obsessively for a few days after.    four days after the encounter i noticed a slight painless redness on the glans(glands)of my penis.    over the past week or so it has seemed to get better and then worse (possibly because i have been checking it so often.    there are no blisters/vesicles, and it is completely painless, but noticeable in good lighting.    i have done a lot of research, and have seen doctor hhh write many times that herpes always starts a rash with vesicles which then burst and crust over.    also it seems that primary infections are accompanied by fever/swollen lymph nodes, neither of which are present.    does this seem like a possible case of herpes? or just irritation from over-checking/obsessing?    also, the girl has told me that she has only had 2 sexual partners before me.thanks for any help
494,currently i am taking 60 mg of cymbalta, i started out taking 40 mg for about 1 month, and my doctor upped my dosage to 60 mg, i've been on this dosage for about 2 months, i would like to ween off this drug. what is the best way to go about getting off this drug? this medication was prescribed to me along with suboxone to curb withdrawl(withdrawal)symptoms from prescription pain killers. i am off the suboxone and want to get off cymbalta, and i have read some statements from others who have been on cymbalta and heard the withdrawl(withdrawal)from it can be horrendous.
495,hi:first, thank you for your advice, thoughts and prayers.    will take as much as i can get.it's been two weeks since i took ma back to the er and a month since this all started.    it seems we are in a holding pattern, but i guess they will make a decision this week about whether to go back in and repair the re-sectioned bowel or not.    the doctor says it depends on how well she is healing.    today was a good day and the wound did not leak so much.    yesterday wasn't such a good day and they had to change her about every hour.    her temperature, white cell count, bp and such are all under control.    she is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, morphine and tpn.she has started to bleed vaginally and the dr. says it is to be expected.     expected by whom?    i certainly didn't know to expect it, my mother certainly didn't know to expect it.    i know we certainly didn't expect her to lay in the hospital for a month with a healing bowel but yet, here we are.my question is:    where can i find information on what to expect.    i've read everything on the internet, most of which is word for word from the previous website i looked at.    i don't need to know what the symptoms are or when i should go to the doctor or what cm a certain tumor is at what stage.    we are past all of that.    what i need to know is what new things may or may not crop up.    i would like to know what to expect before it happens as opposed to as it is happening and someone telling me...oh yeah, that's to be expected.    i know the coarse of this disease is different for most everyone, but is there a guideline, book or website that would help?my mother still has not had any sort of debulking surgery or chemotherapy.    they are still 'letting the bowel heal itself'.    the doctor did mention something about her going into chemotherapy with or without the surgery.    time seems to be running out.i am extremely frustrated.thank you.
496,i have acid reflux badly doc called it gastritis put me on zantac 2 times a day helped a little. are there not tests to show what you have . he said thats what i have without testing me first. i smoke and drink coffee    but am slowing down on these also alot of stress.someone told me to try digestive enzymes and probiotics essentials are they safe and will they help me.thanks
497,i was diagonised with tb and was put on a course of r-cinex 300 two tablets on an empty stomach daily, after 30 days the dosage was increased to three tablets daily and was stopped after about 15 days due to vomiting.during the last few days of medication i felt sharp pains in both feet and a tingling sensation in the skin of both feet and outer side of both calves. this sensation has given way to a numbness and loss of sensation. i am now finding it difficult to walk normally and stumble while trying to run up stairs.is this a normal side effect of r-cinex and will it go away on it's own?

506,i just recieved unprotected oral from my girlfriend and i was wondering what are the chances of contracting or giving an std. we are both complete virgins and this is our first time ever doing anything sexually except masturbation and neither of us has ever had cold sores and we don't believe that either of us has hiv or gonorrhea. we realized that it is pretty uncommon to contract stds from oral sex and we both believe that we weren't born with any stds of our own so we feel that there is nothing to worry about but i was just wondering what the chances are of us getting stds from this. i precummed a fair amount in her mouth and i ejaculated too but not much was in her mouth. we don't believe anything has happened but i would just like some clarification as to what the chances of us getting anything from it are. thanks

510,hello, i am a 22 year old male who was healthy until last october.    my chief complaints are major fatigue, anxiety, depression, daily headaches, night sweats, arthritis like pain in body, heart palpitations and mainly an odd facial sensation.i have had multiple blood test ran along with a 3 chest ct's, 1 abdomen ct (came out i had appendicitis had the surgery still havent got better), multiple ekgs, an echocardiogram and a sinus ct.    all have came back normal.    i am here about the facial sensation.    it is odd in that it is not really a horrible pressure but more a feeling of tightening or pinching in a direct spot.    it seems to run in a line from my hairline in my forehead to the tip of my nose and also between my eyebrows.    it doesnt really hurt all that much but it is very annoying. its like a centralized tightening sensation.    i can get it all over my face but it stays mostly confined between the brows and bridge of my nose and sometimes i get a tightening sensation above my ears and temples.the only pain i get is a slight pressure behind the right eye but it comes and goes.    i have had brain mri and ct scans in the past an all was fine, but i think im going to beg for another one this coming week at my doctors appointment.    i have been seeing doctors for 6 months now and no one seems to know why these things are happening to me.    also, i do not have a recent mri but my last neurologist gave a full inspection of my body (strength, feeling, eye movement) and i have a recent eye check up which showed no signs of internal pressure.anyone have any ideas?all these symptoms started after a 3 month work trip (utah, nevada, kansas, buffalo ny, new york ny) and what was suppose to be a relaxing trip out to vegas.    i first got sick on the way back from vegas had a horrible case of diarrhea followed about an hour later by general malaise, dizziness and sore muscles. i remember my girl friend asking me what was wrong, do you have a headache?    i just told her i was sore all over.please any ideas to discuss with the doctor on tuesday would be nice my family and girl friend just want their old son and boyfriend back an i want to be feeling good to!    before this i was an athlete, skier, hockey player, weight lifter and i ran 7 miles almost daily.    it has now become a chore just to go to work.please help!i have been tested for hiv, west nile and lyme which all came back negative.    i had a positive tuberculous skin test but clear x ray and with no fever dr's dont think thats whats making me tired.    also had very high epstein barr numbers but this gets mixed reviews from the doctors.currently waiting on second set of epstein barr numbers and blood test for different types of fungus's in the areas i visited.    i believe i'm going to ask for another lyme disease test, mri and even maybe something to test for malnutrition (thinking maybe b vitamins or magnesium deficiency ?    i have also not taken a brown looking bowel movement since this began.all help is much appreciated!

513,for the last month and a half or so i will wake up and have pain in my kidney area on my left side. it's never on the right. i don't have fever, nausea, or any other pains or symptoms of anything else.i have no increase in the amount of times i need to urinate.    and it only lasts a day, two at the most.the pain usually kinda shoots up my back and side as i try to move to get more comfortable or breathe in deeply, as you will if a sharp wave of pain hits you. it will kind of continue to shoot like that in waves for a short time. the rest of the day it will be achy and periodically shoot the pain if i breath in deeply or bend around a lot, which my job reqires.but as i said, it only lasts a day, two at the most. what could this possibly be?
514,i also had a breast reduction on jan 4th of this year, just over a week ago. i went back for my week follow-up and informed my doctor of a small lump that i felt in my left breast. he said that he didn't feel anything. tonight, two days later, i was changing into my pajamas and checked it out in the mirror because it was very painful all day and i instantly noticed a huge swollen lump in the very spot that my doctor said was fine. do i have breast cancer?this discussion is related tofound    a painful lump after breast reduction.
515,i know you all have heard this ? hundred times...but i am 8dpo and have been having bad cramps for 3 days now. its a little early for af im on cd28 and i usally get af around cd 34-36...do u think maybe its a preggo sign? or maybe af coming early this month? i know im wishful hoping..i took a hpt this morning and bfn...but i know its really early.
516,hello, hope everyone is well.just a quick question, i went to the loo earlier and notices a little bit of spotting in my underwear. i ovulated either yesterday or the day before that. but i have never had the spotting before.
517,we know that exercise can help lift depression, energize us, keep our hearts healthy; and of course, it can help us lose weight, along with various other benefits.in trying to come up with interesting things to do in order to keep myself moving, i realize that there are a ton of various exercises, games and sports that can be done to keep us healthy, trim and in good spirits.i'm wondering what everyone's favorite exercise might be: walking, running; yoga, bicycling, going to the gym, videos/dvd's, etc.     you can have more than one.    please let us know what you prefer and why (how you    benefit most from it).i'll go first:        some of you who have been around for a while, will know that my favorite is yoga.    yoga centers on breathing, balance and stretching.    for me, it take immense concentration to achieve and hold the postures properly.    in the process of doing this, i have to push *everything* else out of my mind and concentrate only on what i'm doing.    when i've finished a 30 minute session, i feel relaxed, my muscles feel stronger, longer and leaner, my breathing is much easier and i feel a very strong sense of accomplishment.my next favorite is walking.    walking is one of the best exercises we can do.    it's proven to help with weight loss, muscle toning, and helps to make our heart strong, etc. when i go for a walk, i have the opportunity to look around at the sky, see the birds, flowers and other plants, butterflies and whatever else might be in my path.    i get what i might consider a spiritual feeling when i walk because i love being out where i can see all of god's creatures.    a nice walk, both relaxes and invigorates me.okay, now it's your turn.    hopefully, we can come up with a whole list of possibilities for those days when we just feel bored with our routine and want to try something different.................ready, set .............go

521,i crushed my foot on november of 2008 between a motorized pallet jack and a metal rod while i was driving the pallet jack at work. the doctor said i had some fractures on my foot 1 on the heal 2 on the top of foot and 1 on the left side of my left foot where the ball is.    he just put a cast on it and sent me off. afterwards i did therapy but it was painful and kept swelling up. i told the doctor and he said push through it so i was released to go back to work but the pain and swelling was still there and it would get real red.    doctor took me off work again and more therapy but still same results. we tried rsd but the doctor he sent me to said i didnt have the symptoms.    finally he said he didnt know what else he could do for me and workers comp sent me to another doctor. i kept working through the pain and swelling. it would get real bad that i would limp and wouldnt want to put pressure on it. after a couple of years the doctor said i need a fusion on my foot. so after a my lawyer fought to get surgery done in 2011 i got the fusion. but still after a while of walking/standing/or anything with moving my toes it gets painful. it feels week i cant get on my tippy toes/squat/jump/run or play any sports with my kids really because it hurts. and the doctor says to just push through it but i been doing that for some years now. i did get a 2% impairment rating but thats not what i really want. i mean i wouldnt mine the money cuz my lawyer needs to get paid but ill be happy to just get my foot to almost normal. i cant keep a job cuz it swells and hurts and i limp like crazy. so the question i have is what can i do about this or am i stuck with the pain?                 sorry if i wrote to much to get to the question
522,about 2 weeks ago (friday), at work (carpentry at construction site) i had to move several large&heavy pieces of timber from one end of the site to the other. in one of those goes, i took a turn and felt something also turning inside my spine. since then, i have had a weird sensation in my upper back and neck. the afternoon of that day was terrible, i felt like something piercing my back between the shoulder blades, and a continuous tingling sensation at the base of the skull. i even felt tingling on my right arm for a few hours (never happened before). the next day (sat) in the morning i went to a physiotherapist, he did some acupuncture and ultrasound. he stated that just by seeing my back, it was very unlikely to be a herniated disc, that they are fairly rare on the upper back, etc.    he recommended rest for a few days as well. i felt much better and resumed work the next monday. that week the pain came back, not as bad as initially but still on the same spots. i went to another physiotherapist the following monday (this week's). he also stated that it's unlikely i have a herniation, and recommended specialised exercises. he also put straps on my lower back which eliminated the neck tingling right away. today (sat, 2 weeks and 1 day after the incident) i again have tingling at the base of the neck and in the middle of the back. the pain didn't go for good, it just subsided, but it's still constant. could this be a slightly herniated disc? any other possibility? how to know for sure? please help, i don't want to carry chronic back pain (i have a friend who does and he's miserable a great deal of the time) for the rest of my life, until now i was proud not to have any injury there whatsoever, please help!

526,i dont know if anyone can help, but in jan of this year i was meant to have my next shot of depo provera, but due to irregular and prolonged periods i decided not to have anymore. anyways in feb i had a period which lasted like 3-4 weeks, and now im bleeding again. i read that it normally takes a few good months before periods even return???? yet im getting them already. has anyone else had the return as soon as mine, or any advice they can give me?
527,are there other women around 24 weeks passing a large amount of discharge everytime you go to the bathroom?    i don't have any in my panties on a regular basis, but seem to pass alot everytime i go to the bathroom.    i mean it is to the point that you can sometimes see a small bit in the bottom of the toilet.    it is always clear or light yellow.    i know it is gross to share this, but i just wonder if others have the same thing.    it seems like an excessive amount that i don't remember from my first pregnancy but i have had it now for several weeks.
528,i have itchy bumps on my vagina and i ask my friend what it could be and she said she had them awhile ago from it being irritated and they went away in a few week, i also went to the doctor and they also said that it could be from that or little warts. ive had sex with three people and they all were clean and all the people that have had sex with them are clean. so i dont know what it is or what its from.    i really dont wanna say anything to my boyfriend till i know for sure, the doctor also said if they go away by themselves that its probly not warts. could it be from anything else and am i freaking out for no reason?

530,my almost 6 year old is a great student at school, never gives trouble and has thebest grades,only problem is he does not eat his lunch, however at home he is more of a struggle, when he wants to he is the sweetest child but more that half of the time he gets very upset about us asking us to do simple stuff like do his homework, pick up his toys or eat his dinner..he throws tantrums, gets mad,makes faces and even screams, if we send him to his room, he throws everything off the table..this is only when we ask him to do something he doesnt want to do and it doesnt happen all the time, mostly when he is asked to eat (he hatess eating).i asked him once why he was good at school and like this at home and he answered something like because at school they dont tell me to do stuff i dont want to do...any advice on how to treat this behavior? his dad loses his temper fast and im afraid its getting on his nerves
531,how do i get rid of constant phlegm, have had it for 2 years since i was told i have cdifficile. at times its so thick i have trouble swallowing, also have constant bad breath.
532,okay i had posted a question about not detecting a heart beat, and well i havent at 3 ultrasounds so far, all done both regular and transvaginal. both of the doctors i had went to see told me i would eventually miscarry and that the baby was not alive. so after all of that bad news, and me still being in denail i guess im just wondering, i havent bled, clotted, spotted once through this whole pregnancy.. ive had some bad cramps but im still wondering has anyone miscarried without having any spotting or bleeding? and how do you know the miscarriage is going to start, or whatever? im so lost, as this being my first miscarriage, ive had 2 healthy pregnancies in the last 2 years.. so im lost with miscarriage! any help will be so greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.
533,recently ive noticed one of my pupils is larger than the other. this usually occurs late at night and when im tired. when it is at its largest incomparison to the other i feel really dizzy and feel like im about to fall over. during the day my pupils seem to be really small but of similar size.ive also recently been having pains in my chest and panic attacks. i had a resting ecg and this was okay, just waiting back on the 24hr ecg results. but i feel its more in my head than my chest as ive been having really bad headaches, and pressure accross the bridge of my nose. i took a trip to the opticians and they told me my eyesight is fine and that i do not need glasses.i am now really worried, as i feel dizzy everyday, and periods where im walking for quite a while i feel as though im about to fall over to the righthand side and feel extremely dizzy. sometimes it feels like its a struggle to walk and i have to force my body to keep moving. the same thing occasionally occurs with my speech, i can still speak but i have a feeling as if my body is forcing me not to speak.along with these symptoms, my eyes have been of a really dark yellow which i think has something to do with gilberts syndrome that i have but it seems worse than usual, i have little energy, my skin is bruising more easily, especially on my legs, i have ringing in my ears, occasionally have blurred vision, especially if i eat and walk at the same time my vision moves up and down, theres also like a clicking/sucking noise behind my right eye, this only happens again late at night when im tired etc.any ideas on what these things could be? i have been feeling unwell now for 8 weeks, and havnt really got anywhere with the appointments at the doctors. its starting to really worry me.
534,the total cost of the work including permanent crowns with insurance would have been around 11000. however i decided to change dentist at the phase when i was in temporary crowns placed on but i wasn't satisfied with the work done. the dentist refunded me 4000, so he basically charged me 7000 for the work done until now,( filling down    8 upper teeth and placing a one piece temporary on them, no final crowns were fabricated, and received). the total labor time was around 4 hours. it's his cost reasonable?

551,my 4 year old son has always had a lot of energy.    he runs more than other kids, yells more than other kids and is extreme in all behaviors.    he started saying words at 10 months, is very bright, and is top in his class at preschool academically.    he poses the most thoughtful questions, loves to read, do homework, etc.    because of his impulsivity and hyperactivtiy i thought he had adhd from the age of 2 to 4.    but i didn't know because at about 3 1/2 he started some other odd behaviors.    he was sniffing his nose constantly, all day, everyday.    he would wipe his mouth over and over and lick his lips until they were raw.    he would make up weird words and demand that we use them like call me enopi, or this tool isn't a spatula it's a mahu, or whatever.    he would yells out suddenly or scream repeatedly.    he was pretty agressive with his twin 19 month old sisters, and started talking about a wolf in the house that he was scared of.    then i started thinking he had tourettes, or anxiety disorder.    suddenly at about 4 he really mellowed out.    i was watching what he ate more, feeding him attentive child vitamins along with omega 3 vitamins and i really started noticing a difference.    he still is a boy, but maybe more a normal boy.    he has been socializing better, he has been easier to discipline and he has been getting stickers in preschool each time.    his sniffing stopped completely as did almost all the other above explained behaviors.    on tuesday i took him to get his 4 year shots.    i only got dtap, and varicella.    on wednesday morning he woke up and my old, bizarre child was back. the one that has been gone for about 2 months now.    all of the behaviors i explained have completely come back.    he hasn't missed a day of vitamins, he is still eating well, mostly organic food, and the only thing i can think of are this stupid shots.    he didn't get a sticker in preschool, and my husband and in laws noticed a change as well.    today is saturday and he is still engaging in these odd behaviors.    i am sick to my stomach and utterly confused as to what is going on.    i thought previously that he must have grown out of these behaviors and i was ever so grateful.    now i sit in tears listening to him in his room making weird humming, munching, swirling, spitting sounds, talking to himself, repeating phrases, etc.    the odd thing is we just came from a bbq where he behaved very well playing in a playhouse with another child.    he didn't scream out there, repeat phrases, or anything else...what is happening to my angel?     please, please help me!    i am desperate!

554,i will be doing our first ivf treatment starting this month.    of couse, as you know, it will be a couple month process with my protocol.    we have been ttc since july of 2007.    it is secondary infertility on my part, however, my husband has never had children.    i have three children from a previous marriage.    all were normal, easy pregnancies.    i also didn't even have to try to get pregnant with them, as they were all surprises.    my husband and i were married in june of 2007 and have been trying ever since.    we have done two iui's with clomid and we have done one round of injectables with iui.    i have had an hsg and a lap, both normal.    i have had my prolactin, thyroid ( i think that was the same test?) fsh and progesterone checked.    all normal.    my husband has had two seman analysis which were normal.    on one occasion, when i was getting our second iui, my husband was asked by my re's nurse if he had had a sa done, and we had to remind her that he had in fact had one.    she said they looked sluggish that day, so that has always haunted me.    we have not miscarried, i have completly normal perfect 28 day cycles, i temped for a very long time which revealed nothing.....we are at the point where we think the reason we are not getting pregnant, and our re agrees, is his sperm is not penetrating my egg.    no conception is taking place, no fertilization is taking place.    so, i guess what i need to know is, what is the main reason why ivf does not work for some patients?    i have been reading and the main reason i see is egg quality.    we are not going to know my egg quality until i go in for my retrieval.    i responded well to follistim, and for the ivf i will be doing follistim and menopur, so if egg quality is my issue, i am hoping that will help.    my youngest child turned 7 this past july....so it hasn't been that long that i conceived her.    i am 33 years old.    (turning 34 in march)    i am 5'2, 115 pounds, in great health, i work out.....i guess i am just asking, what reasons are most common for ivf not working?thanks so much for your help and insight....i'm just nervous....

557,my daughter is 4 and will be 5 next week.    for the past few months i have been having behavior problems with her.    when told she can't do somthing or no she goes into temper tantrums.    she gets into rages where she will cry for hours, throw things, scream, and kick/slam doors.    she is now mouthing off and will laugh when i tell her not to do something and continues to do it.    i have tried time out, spanking, taking toys away, and talking.    nothing seems to work!!    she just started pre-k 4 months ago.    i'm not sure if she is learning this behavior from school or not.    she doesn't act like this @ school.    the teacher said she's the best behaved child in the class.    shoud i put her in anger management counseling or have an assessment done?    is there something i can do to resolve this problem w/o counseling?

560,i was told i have two mthfrmutations, the bloodclotting dissorders.(two copys, as my dr said) so i am guessing one copy from my mother and one from my father.    so now when i get preg. i have to take 81mg. of baby asprin a day, projestrone(sp?), and my vitimins. and was told that i could only take two types of birthcontroll, the minipill and the merina(sp?), the bc that goes in your cirvex i believe. but my husband and i just decided to use condoms.i have 2 sisters (younger than me) one 16, one 10. now my middle sister is having sex, and is on the ring, she knows she isnt ready and she says they use a condom too.(i know that sounds young but i was 15 and married the man that was my first and she is still with the boy she gave herself to and they have been together for almost a year, and they are using protection, back to the subject((i get side tracked very easily)))*** but my question is since i have the bloodclotting dissorder should she get tested too for the same bloodclotting dissorders??? since she is taking a birthcontroll. i am just worried about if she has it too, then the type of birthcontroll she is on can up her chances of a bloodclott.

570,what would you do?took my 4 yo in yesterday to get immunizations.    she had her health check in august but at the time they did not have all the imm. necessary so if i remember correctly i opted to wait until they had them all before getting any done.    we get there yesterday and the doctor gives her 5 shots, including the flu shot.    then as i'm checking out, the lady at the front desk says she didn't need all those shots, she only need the flu and one immun.    so i ask the doctor who says he didn't see where she had them back in august    i don't remember her getting any shots back in august, but they had them listed in her shot record as having had them...then they gave them to her again yesterday. so, either they aren't keeping records right or they just double dosed her.i started checking on this doc and the georgia medical board has no record of him.    but i can only find his first initial and last name.    the office won't give me his full first name.    the practice is listed under another doctor, who is licensed.    but it seems this particular one is not.    though he is passing himself off as an md.i plan to obtain copies of my kids records from their office then file a complaint against him.    any one else ever been through something like this?

575,chicago - a nurse may soon be your doctor.with a looming shortage of primary care doctors, 28 states are considering expanding the authority of nurse practitioners. these nurses with advanced degrees want the right to practice without a doctor's watchful eye and to prescribe narcotics. and if they hold a doctorate, they want to be called doctor.for years, nurse practitioners have been playing a bigger role in the nation's health care, especially in regions with few doctors. with 32 million more americans gaining health insurance within a few years, the health care overhaul is putting more money into nurse-managed clinics.those newly insured patients will be looking for doctors and may find nurses instead.the medical establishment is fighting to protect turf. in some statehouses, doctors have shown up in white coats to testify against nurse practitioner bills. the american medical association, which supported the national health care overhaul, says a doctor shortage is no reason to put nurses in charge and endanger patients.nurse practitioners argue there's no danger. they say they're highly trained and as skilled as doctors at diagnosing illness during office visits. they know when to refer the sickest patients to doctor specialists. plus, they spend more time with patients and charge less.we're constantly having to prove ourselves, said chicago nurse practitioner amanda cockrell, 32, who tells patients she's just like a doctor except for the pay.on top of four years in nursing school, cockrell spent another three years in a nurse practitioner program, much of it working with patients. doctors generally spend four years in undergraduate school four years in medical school and an additional three in primary care residency training.medicare, which sets the pace for payments by private insurance, pays nurse practitioners 85 percent of what it pays doctors. an office visit for a medicare patient in chicago, for example, pays a doctor about $70 and a nurse practitioner about $60.the health care overhaul law gave nurse midwives, a type of advanced practice nurse, a medicare raise to 100 percent of what obstetrician-gynecologists make    and that may be just the beginning.states regulate nurse practitioners and laws vary on what they are permitted to do:in florida and alabama, for instance, nurse practitioners are barred from prescribing controlled substances.in washington, nurse practitioners can recommend medical marijuana to their patients when a new law takes effect in june.in montana, nurse practitioners don't need a doctor involved with their practice in any way.many other states put doctors in charge of nurse practitioners or require collaborative agreements signed by a doctor.in some states, nurse practitioners with a doctorate in nursing practice can't use the title dr. most states allow it.the ama argues the title dr. creates confusion. nurse practitioners say patients aren't confused by veterinarians calling themselves dr. or chiropractors. or dentists. so why, they ask, would patients be confused by a nurse using the title?by 2015, most new nurse practitioners will hold doctorates, or a dnp, in nursing practice, according to a goal set by nursing educators. by then, the doctorate will be the standard for all graduating nurse practitioners, said polly bednash, executive director of the american association of colleges of nursing.many with the title use it with pride.i don't think patients are ever confused. people are not stupid, said linda roemer, a nurse practitioner in sedona, ariz., who uses dr. roemer as part of her e-mail address.quality of care same as docs, study finds what's the evidence on the quality of care given by nurse practitioners?the best u.s. study comparing nurse practitioners and doctors randomly assigned more than 1,300 patients to either a nurse practitioner or a doctor. after six months, overall health, diabetes tests, asthma tests and use of medical services like specialists were essentially the same in the two groups.the argument that patients' health is put in jeopardy by nurse practitioners? there's no evidence to support that, said jack needleman, a health policy expert at the university of california los angeles school of public health.other studies have shown that nurse practitioners are better at listening to patients, needleman said. and they make good decisions about when to refer patients to doctors for more specialized care.the nonpartisan macy foundation, a new york-based charity that focuses on the education of health professionals, recently called for nurse practitioners to be among the leaders of primary care teams. the foundation also urged the removal of state and federal barriers preventing nurse practitioners from providing primary care.ama fighting proposals to expand carethe american medical association is fighting proposals in about 28 states that are considering steps to expand what nurse practitioners can do.for rest of article see the following:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36472308/ns/health-health_care/

579,http://www.npr.org/2012/10/31/163658514/as-economy-slows-china-looks-for-a-new-modelthe only plans i've heard to turn our economy around seem to involve immitatng what china has done for the past 20 years. if you don't give a care for the environment or the kind of world we leave our children ......wait for it........it still doesn't work.as economy slows, china looks for a new modelif you followed american media in recent years, you might have thought china was taking over the planet. recent titles at the book store have included becoming china's ***** and when china rules the world.they are the world's superpower or soon will be, glenn beck used to intone on fox news. they always thought america was just a blip...............but china always looks more impressive from afar than it does close up.........ask chinese economists about the future of the world's second-largest economy and the tone these days is uncertain and anxious.i'm not as optimistic as many people in the western world think about china, says xu dingbo, associate dean of the china europe international business school in beijing.if you want to be the world leader, i think china is far from ready, adds wang jianmao, his fellow business school professor.........why do these men sound so somber after so many years of spectacular growth here? the reason is that the economic formula that brought china such success no longer works............

609,i am 32 and had a total hysteremctomy 1.5 yrs. ago.    i was put on hormones and i took them for a while, but it did not help with the hot flashes.    i saw another dr. who has a totally different way of approaching hot flashes.    she put me on a estrogen spray (evamist) which i spray on the inside of my left arm 2 sprays every night and the she put me on androgel ( testosterone ).    its a gel and i use 1 pump every other night and apply it to the inside of my right arm.    i am scared to take these drugs and have stopped taking them like i am suppose to.    my aunt recentely got diagnosed with breast cancer and it seems like there are a lot of people around me getting cancer or someone knows someone who has it or has had it due to taking these hormones after a hysterectomy.    i would like to go a natural route, but don't know who to turn to.    i can not deal with these hot flashes.    during one it feels like my blood boils inside and the sweat just pours down.    i can't sleep at night without a fan blowing on me, and am constantely up and down at night.    please does anyone know what to do?    i know i can't take hormones for a long time, but what are women suppose to do in the mean time with the symptoms until they reach menopause on their own?    does anyone know if vitamins actually work for preventing osteoporosis?    vitamin d and calcium.thank youshuffle
610,i have two slightly swollen lymph nodes on the left of my neck, and i am wondering if they are normal size. i recently saw my primary care physician who said i just had a gland that popped out and that i they weren't large enough to cause concern.the largest is about the width of my index finger (maybe half and inch) and they have been palpably present for a little less than a year now. should i push for further investigation? is this a normal size for lymph nodes in the neck?

613,i just started the ivf shared donor egg process.    i am the recipentant.    i have just started the birth control pill.    how long is the process before implanting the embryo?
614,a week ago i went in for my first ob exam. the doctors office told me that based on their calculations i was 13 weeks pregnant. great news because i thought i was about 10 weeks. they asked me to come back the next day because they were not able to hear the heart beat using the doppler. they said not to worry that you usually can not hear it until about 11 weeks. not worrying i went back the next day.two vaginal ultrasounds confirmed that the baby did not have a heart beat. they said the baby stopped growing at 8 1/2 weeks. the doctor said i could either allow my body to shed the baby naturally, or i could have a d&c. i was hoping to let nature take it's course. so now i am fixated on the fact that the baby died 6 weeks ago, and is still inside my body. accepting the news has been so sad and difficult. i still feel pregnant. has anyone else experienced this before? i would have thought that the baby would have passed my body by now. i have had no bleeding at all.
615,hi i stopped taking bc november 13 2011. i got a af dec and jan . my last af was jan 12 2012. i had sex sex on jan 21st and 23rd both pull out method. i know.....i should have gotten my expected af feb 10th and have yet to receive. i am now 6 weeks with no af. i have taken 7 hpt all negative . my last one was feb 28 2012. should i go have a blood test or am i very pretty safe to say its negative and i'm just late?
616,i had a tooth prepared for a crown last week. it was the upper molar, furthest back ( i don't have my wisdom teeth). i wasn't able to chew on the temporary crown even four or five days later. then i started experiencing throbbing pain in the lower teeth, not the one directly below the tooth with the temporary crown, but the two further forward. i have been taking tylenol since then, as soon as it wears off bottom teeth start to hurt again. went to the dentist today and he filed the tooth down, but the bottom teeth still hurt. could the crowned tooth be higher than the other teeth causing the two that are further forward to put more pressure on the ones below? what else could be causing this pain? the temporary crown only hurts when i chew on it, otherwise the tooth that was worked on is not that sore...thanks, carrie
617,so, i am now 27 weeks pregnant, and am very anxious. i haven't bought anything for the baby, i keep telling everyone i'm waiting until april.. and next month is april!    yeah!when did you all start buying for your baby, and what did you buy?    also, when did you get the babys room ready?the baby will be sharing the room with my other daughter who is 4.    she's excited, but i'm not sure when to get it ready.    i don't want to wait until i'm to far along that i can't do it, and don't want to start to early either. lol.thanks.
618,i have a very stupid question...    so i had a like 10 hcg count 3 weeks ago or so, i have not had any bleeding whatsoever.    my husband and i have not used any protection because we figured i would have to miscarry before i could get pregnant again...    (we want another baby, but we wanted to wait a month or two before trying again, give my body time to heal you know).    i have not had a d&c, i had a blighted ovum which was diagnosed at 6 weeks, but the ultrasound showed it was still at 4 weeks, and it never progressed from there.    someone told me, that it is possible to have a miscarriage without bleeding specially in the beginning because your body can reabsorb the baby-is that true?    and if so, could i get pregnant before having a period because i know that to have a period you have to ovulate, and if an egg is fertilized, you are pregnant?    my doctor did not mention taking any birth control precautions
619,i am very early along in pregnancy and have been having some probs with my blood sugar staying below 60..i have been following doctors orders with eating between meal and drinking juice but i can't seem to get it to normal..i have never had any probs with my sugar befor..any tips?or iddeas what might cause this?
620,recently i have been experiencing weight gain and a loss of hair. i am 21 years old and i'm not sure what is going on? could it be low iron, thyroid disease or related to my recent discontinuing of birth control?
621,hiii! im worried, i had sex with my boyfriend saturday right after my monthly period. he was rubbing his penis in my vagina before he entered me with condom, so i decided to add extra precaution and took the morning after pill. a week after i started bleeding, enough to make a big mark on a panty liner. that day i had sex with my boyfriend and right after sex my bleeding stopped. then after last week i had another episode of bleeding/ spotting a week right after ( so basically, ive been bleeding for atleast 3 hours, once a week) what does that mean? is it still because of the morning after pill? or is it already an implantation bleeding type what does that mean? is that implantation bleeding or spotting? am i pregnant? please help!
622,respected sir\mam,i have 3 kids and    after each delivery i used to get my menstrual cycle regular by the 3rd month , but after my 3rd delivery my baby is now six months    i did not have my menses till now i    did    test for pregnancy but it is negative ,    why is it becoming so late is it possible for me to take    any medicine that    will make me menstruate. please help me please give me a suggestion.
623,a year ago, the filling in my upper right molar broke.    it's the tooth second from the back (not including wisdom tooth) that nerves run directly into the maxillary sinus.        when the filling broke, it was drilled out and a very large filling put in.        but after that procedure it was sore for a couple months.after this, i had an on and off low grade fever for many months and eventually a very severe pain developed in that tooth when biting,    pain in that right maxillary sinus,    and the pain spread back to my jaw, and below my jaw down my neck with swollen lymph nodes.however, surprisingly for me, the repeated bite wing x-rays did not reveal anything.     however, i took amoxicillin and the symptoms quickly went away after 5 days.        the symptoms didn't bother me except mildly on and off for several more months, but last week as i was exercising and lifting weights, i began to feel my heartbeat painfully in the tooth and the pain quickly onset again like before, very severe pain in the same areas...to my sinus, pain when biting,    pain in jaw and neck with swollen lymph nodes as before.the dentist who did the work dismissed any intervention due to the normal x-rays, and i was okay with that because the amoxil got rid of the symptoms the first time, but this time it's not working completely to help my symptoms,    only 50% maybe by day 6 of amoxil.since i'm highly sensitive to many antibiotic side effects, i'm unsure of what to do.    does this definitely sound like a tooth problem and would just having it pulled get rid of the pain for good?
624,i just underwent my first ivf attempt. during the retrieval process i was told that most of the follicles they removed were actually cysts, and only three were mature eggs. out of those three, two fertilized and were transferred on day 2, but no pregnancy resulted. my question is, if all of the cysts were removed during the retrieval process, will i produce more cysts if i try again, or would i only produce eggs since the cysts were all removed?
625,my son has been potty trained since he was 2 years old. well im trying to figure    out wht in the last 2 months he has started pooping and peeing on him slef.. anybody have any answers at all for me.... i have been told that i need to get him checked to see if there is something wrong with him, or god forbit he has been messed with . can you help me?
626,i am 50 years old.full hystorectomy at 42 years. use vit. supplement vascofem instead of hormone replacement therapy for last 3 years.vascofem copies estrogen. (contains natural ingredients and vit. c.)lately have a thick vericose vein on the side of my knee which sometimes are painfull, especially at night.a few days ago my two big toe-nails suddenly went blue and feels cold.looks like blood under the nail. what is wrong?
627,so i had the best job ive ever had bartending on the beach and loved it, well i feel in love with my boss and her boss gave us the opition to stop seeing each other or one of us quit, so i quit. she has a 2 year old and a mortgage and i dont so the decision was easy for me. we moved pretty fast from the start i was with her and her daughter alot and had great times. and now recently shes been depressed about her family, she cut ties with her sister, the childs fathers parents split up after he beat her and the father is two states away. now shes saying we moved fast and needs space to have mommy daughter time and that she cant give me what i need and wants to break up. i work alot and she does also i dont ask or need much and ive always been there for her. is she just not seeing that she has a male figure for her daughter and somebody that loves her so much standing right here, is she scared? shes always bee very independent and wants things her way. and i know she loves me just as much i do her, im at my wits end i have invested so much into this relationship and dont know what to do from here?
628,my 14 month-old had flat feet. this is causing her to walk on the inside of her feet. when she is standing straight, her legs (from the knees down) appear to angle out because she is standing with her weight on the insides of her feet. our pediatrician says that she will grow out of it but may need orthodics in the future. we also took her to a foot doctor who said the same thing. my concern is waiting until she is 2 or 3 years old and then being told we should have done something earlier because now it's too late. is there a risk of causing permanent damage to her knee and/or ankle joints or to her growing bones? should she be evaluated for braces or orthodics now? any i just a worried first time mom??thank you in advance for your time and advise.
629,i know this gets asked a ton on here, but i was wondering when you noticed a slow down in movement? i am 36 1/2 weeks, and have noticed a steady drop in sharp movement, though she is still moving. i was panicking last night, because she does not move much at all at night when i am asleep, and it took me several minutes to rouse her after i came back from the bathroom.(laid on one side, then moved to the other, then sat up, rubbed and talked to my belly...that finally worked, 10 minutes later) she remains fairly active during the day, but the movements are a lot slower and not all over the place. i wonder how much a baby should be moving at this point. i keep asking my midwife, and she just says, ''as long as she is moving...'' i just wonder how i would know if my baby was in distress....

632,hi! my son is just over 4 years old and is very touchy, feely. he is definitely all boy. recently he has been getting in trouble at his school (which is a montessori school) for being aggressive, wild, and touching others, even the students are complaining about him at this point.    to better clarify, his general temperment is sweet, kind and loving underneath all the behaviour stuff. he is very social and funny. he loves his friends and family a lot as well as meeting new people and playing all the time.    on the other hand, he totally lacks impulse control.    he is wild much of the time (running, jumping, and making purposeful noises) and aggressive ( although i am not completely sure this is the right word).    he pushes and does a lot of super hero moves on his friends when they are trying to work and when he is suppose to be working.    it seems as though he is just wanting to have fun but doesn't know how to control himself so he asserts himself while laughing and giggling the whole time.    he is rarely angry or doing this wild behaviour out of anger.    he also just touches people all the time: hugging me, wrestling with daddy, tagging his friends, rubbing a stranger's back, hugging absolutely anyone, anytime even strangers, especially kids who are friendly to him.    it is constant.    i am at a loss how to curb this behaviour especially when it is not all bad.    recently, we have resorted to a philosophy of never touch your friends or anyone else ever!    this seems harsh though.    please help!!    kelly

639,dear sirmy 8 year old has been complaining these past months about his vision.    he says sometimes his vision seems to go from side to side as though what he is looking at is quickly moving back and forth.    this has just come out of the blue, he has been to the optician and he cant see anything wrong.    my wee boy    seems otherwise healthy but i know when this happens it scares him.    it lasts anywhere from 10-20 seconds.    some days he doesn't get it and other days he could get it 2-3 timescan you help me please and let me knowif there is anything to worry about herethank you so much
640,i had mirena for about 11 months.i bleed for the first 3 months straight and doc put me on some pill (only had to take for 5 days)to regulate a period(while i had mirena in)and that worked! i had it removed on may 9, 2007., because my husband and i wanted to try for baby #2. i had regulated periods every month after the removal. my last period was august 2 and lasted 7 days (normal) and i have not gotten a period since. i took 7 hpt all neg and a blood test about 3 weeks ago which was also neg. the doc said the the hormones were probably still in my body and if i don't get a period by the end of october then she wants to do some more blood work, eventhough mirena claims you can conceive as though you weren't on any birth control method at all. i thought it was all in my head and i would surely get my period after the blood test result, and still no period. when i got pregnant with my first son i was on birth control pills(loestirn28) for 7 years and it only took me 2 months to conceive after i stopped hte pill,    so i don't think any hormones would still be in my body from mirena being it is 4 1/2 months after the removal! i was wondering if anyone else had any of the same probs when they were trying to conceive after the iud.

650,against pennsylvania justices for not upholding voter id lawearlier this week, every single sitting pennsylvania supreme court justice rejected a lower court decision allowing that state  s voter id law to take effect. four justices joined a majority opinion requiring the lower court judge to look at the case again due to concerns that voters were unable to obtain the ids they were supposed to have easy access to as a matter of law, and two more justices joined a dissent arguing that the law should simply be suspended right away. three of the justices in the majority were republicans.nevertheless, a tea party group is now threatening to exact revenge upon the state supreme court for refusing to uphold a law that prevents many low-income, student and minority voters from casting a ballot:a philadelphia-area tea party group says it will work to defeat two state supreme court justices next year if the state  s new voter identification law isn  t in effect for the nov. 6 election.the independence hall tea party on thursday also criticized the court  s decision to send a legal challenge to the law back for a lower court review.it called the decision   a cowardly move   to   punt the ball.  chief justice ronald castille, a republican, and justice max baer, a democrat, are each finishing a 10-year term in january 2014.these kinds of campaigns of vengeance against justices who place the law ahead of conservative  s policy preferences are increasingly common. two years ago, a florida tea party group launched a similar revenge campaign after the florida supreme court kept an unconstitutional ballot initiative attempting to nullify the affordable care act off the state ballot. similarly, anti-gay groups poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into a successful effort to remove three iowa supreme court justices because they had the audacity to recognize that the state  s constitution does not permit discrimination against gay couples.as a recent center for american progress report explains, corporate interest groups have also spent big money to stack state judiciaries with friendly judges and justices. in one of the most egregious cases, a west virginia coal baron spent $3 million to buy a seat on the state supreme court for a justice who later went on to strike down a $50 million verdict against his company, although the u.s. supreme court ultimately ruled that the bought-and-paid-for justice should have recused himself.http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/09/21/887711/tea-party-threatens-revenge-against-pennsylvania-justices-for-not-upholding-voter-id-law/?mobile=nc
651,i just had my son three weeks ago and lately every time i feed him he spits up. i burp him wheni change breasts and after he's done and sometimes he burps sometimes he doesn't. then he calls asleep so i lay him down and he spits up in his sleep. a few times i've been holding him upright and he still spits up. is this normal or is there something i'm doing wrong?
652,hi,i have been wearing glasses since i was around 7 years old(started with -3d). the problem is that even though i have grown up now(i will turn 27 this november), the myopia hasn't stopped from progressing. today i wear -13d in both eyes and the last time i had to change my glasses was in the march of this year as the power increased from -11.5d to -13d. i am again getting the feeling that i am not able to see clearly from my right eye. the point worth mentioning is that i have such feeling only when i put my contact lens(-12d in both eyes) on and with glasses(-13d) on, i don't have any such feeling. i wonder why this is happening to me when i have got a new pair of contact lenses as per the prescription from my eye specialist. i am really worried abt the future and wonder when would the eye-sight stabilise. i have also noticed that whenever i do some physical labour (like running on treadmill or cycling), it seem to be causing my eye sight to deteriorate. please could someone suggest if there is really a relation between physical labour and weakening eyesight.my eye specialist did not allow me to go for lasik laser surgery saying that she could see some retinal changes in my eye and it would not be advisable to go for surgery in near future. any thoughts on that....thanks in advance.kakaatoo!
653,a year ago i had my gall bladder removed and after that i would throw up bile occasionally. it use to happen once every few months but now it has increased and is happening like six times a month. i wake out of a dead sleep and feel right drained and my right arm feels tingling and i have to run to the bathroom immediately. every time i get this feeling i immediately know i am going to throw up the bile again. it is a dark yellow color. someone else who had there gall bladder removed told me it was normal. is it?
654,alright...at the beginning of january 2009, i stopped taking the birth control pill because i suspected that the hormone levels were too high for me. at that point i'd been on the particular pill for a year and a half and was noticing i was far more depressed and crabby than usual--particularly just before it was time to take the sugar pills. the nurse at the health clinic suggested i stay off the pill for three months and see if i notice any emotional changes. i told her i would be sexually active during the time between and she gave me a bunch of condoms.anyway, i'm usually pretty regular with my periods, and it came a week late in january--i figured this was due to my body adjusting to not being on the pill anymore. my period at this time was also much lighter than it usually was before i was on the pill--i usually experience bad cramps and heavy flow, but my period was light and painless like it was when i was on the pill.now comes february, and i was expecting my period on the twentieth or so, but it still hasn't arrived... and we're at march 4th.my boyfriend and i have used a condom each time we've had intercourse, the condom has never broken or torn and (this is perhaps too much information), i get very wet during intercourse, so lubrication is not a problem for us either.anyway, i've been feeling bloated and gassy for the past week, have been experiencing slight cramping and constipation, and figured my period would arrive. it still hasn't, and i've noticed that my regular discharge has thickened--and it looks very similar to the egg white cervical mucous that i used to see before i was on the pill.basically, my question is: are my hormones out of whack because of the birth control pill, and i'm only now starting ovulation again (as could be the case due to the mucous)? or should i go out and get a pregnancy test? i really don't think i'm pregnant, but it's still frustrating to be late when you're trying not to get pregnant.
655,i had a d&c 5-weeks ago after a blighted ovum at 7-weeks. since then, i have been generally ill feeiling. fatigue sets in suddenly, i have been getting very light cramps and this morning, when i thought af was coming i instead got some brown spotting and nothing since. now today i am feeling very tired and generally crappy.should i worried about the brown spotting? i understand that it can take a while for af to come, but the brown discharge is concerning.
656,ok, i am concerned about this, i am going to see a dentist about this but until i do, i just need some answers, hopefully. ok....before the start of the year of 2007 i had a root canal done that i still need to get a cap on, anyways, it is just a coincendence but after i had the root canal, there has been a bump on my gum, it is where my gum and lip connect i guess i would say, my root canal was done on my left front tooth but the bump is above my right front tooth right where the lip and the gum connect, and it does make my face swell if it goes untreated. i have been taking amoxicillin and it goes away but then it comes back in the same spot. it does not hurt unless i press on it.    does anyone know what this sounds like? please let me know. thank you so much

665,new york    a 31-year-old bronx woman who was seen muttering to herself before shoving a man onto subway tracks in front of a speeding train said she did so because, i hate hindus and muslims, prosecutors said.queens district attorney richard a. brown identified the woman as erika menendez, 31. she has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, new york city authorities said. in a statement, brown said that awaits arraignment in queens criminal court.menendez admitted to investigators that she pushed sunando sen, a 46-year-old queens resident, on thursday because of her hatred of hindus and muslims, a feeling that stems from sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.sen was born in india and ran a printing shop. he died thursday night after being knocked onto the tracks. police released security camera video showing a woman running from the station.police said that menendez was recognized on the street in brooklyn by a passer-by who called 911. patrol officers found and arrested her.brown's statement said that while in custody menendez made incriminating statements, saying that she pushed a muslim onto the tracks. brown also said:the defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter's worst nightmare - being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train. the victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself. beyond that, the hateful remarks allegedly made by the defendant and which precipitated the defendant's actions can never be tolerated by a civilized society.the attack was the second time this month that someone was pushed to their death in a new york city subway station. a homeless man was arrested in early december and accused of shoving a man in front of a train in times square. he is awaiting trial, and claimed he acted in self-defense.further details on how police managed to identify the suspect in sen's death were not immediately available.a woman is reportedly in custody in connection with the death of a man who was struck by an oncoming nyc subway.investigators had been following up on tips from people who had seen the security video and were checking homeless shelters and psychiatric units in an attempt to identify the woman.it was unclear whether menendez had any connection to sen. witnesses told police the two hadn't interacted on the platform as they both waited for the train.http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/29/16235799-woman-charged-with-hate-crime-murder-in-death-of-man-pushed-in-front-of-nyc-train
666,i really hope some one can help. i had a prolapse (rectocele) repair 8 weeks ago. in the last 2 weeks i have had severe pressure in my rectum it is so uncomfortable to sit or drive and i cannot complete a bowel movement and i have a lot of gas.    i have been to my gp as i thought maybe i had hemorrhoids but she did not find anything. i have lost my appetite and feel so bloated & have nausea when i eat.    please if anyone has experienced anything like this could they let me know i am so uncomfortable and worn out from the constant pressure.
667,hi, it's been a while. i had a metho shot for an assumed ectopic pregnancy in november (my hcg was only at 600 something and there was a 1 cm mass in the area of my right tube) and by mid/end december my betas were back to normal and i had bled out, with very little pain. in january i had a normal period, which would have resulted from ovulation on my left side. last week, i got my period for this month, and it would have been my first resulting from ovulation on the right side, where the ectopic was. however, my period was a week late and from the time i was supposed to start, and i had sharp pain on my right side, like i did with the ectopic pregnancy. not horrible, but paiful enough. i did have what seemed like a normal period, along with three negative pregnancy tests (1 the day after i was supposed to start and didn't, 1 the day before i actually did start, a week late, and one the fourth day after i started, when the bleeding stopped). so my question is this--why am i still having sharp pain on my right lower side?? it is like a muscle cramp or tear, and gets worse if i am really active, like driving our car (a standard :o)) and spreads into my hip and back and leg. has anyone else experienced this? i am waiting to call the doctor because i am convinced it is not another ectopic, but still don't know? is it just because the tube still needs to heal? sorry this was soooo loooong....~a

672,my daughter is 4 1/2 and started pre-k in september. for the past several weeks she has been throwing absolutely cylonic tantrums in the mornings which start with obsessing about what she will wear that the other children won't be wearing the same thing to the last several days hiding under her bed and refusing to go to school, running away from the classroom screaming and crying. i usually have to leave her in her teacher's arms crying and doing a quick exit. she usually stops crying within minutes of my leaving and does great for the rest of the day. she is there from 9-3 pm t, th and 9-1230p m,w,f. she says she just wants to be home with me and doesn't want to go to school and she misses me terribly. i have been trying the positive reinforcement of giving her stickers for each day she does well and letting her pick a special treat or mommy/daddy time without her older sisters who are 6 and 8 yrs. old. while it worked for a couple of days doesn't work anymore. i just don't know what to do at this point and mornings are really wearing us both down!
673,last night i was laying down on my left side snuggled up to my hubby, and when i went to move my arm down from his chest to roll over to get my water i felt my night gown was wet.    so i shot up out of bed cut on the light and had a 50cent size wet spot right over my nipple area.    so i know it was the stuff that comes before milk comes in. (just forgot what it is called. i know it starts with a c)my husband was laughing and saying well atleast if she comes before she is suposto(sp?) you will have something to feed her with. i laughed too, it was funny to us.**anyways my ? is do yall remember when you started to leak?? i am only 31w5d, isnt that too early?

675,just a quick question.... should i be getting a flu shot? i can't seem to get in contact with either of my doctors..
676,i will just very quickly summarize the condtion of the shaft of my penis as of late. i noticed an extreme    inflammation occur once a few months ago after i cleaned my house which coincided with a rather severe allergy attack on the shaft of my penis. it has since never healed; i had tracts of skin more or less shed straight off of the penis, which would then appear glossy, with a thin layer of clear filmy liquid covering the exposed area. the whole shaft also occasionally goes through intense periods of itching. recently, small red, circular dots have appeared on the head, which come and go, wax and wane in their visibilty. the skin on the entire shaft seems to come off with just slight provocation. i have almost lost the ability to come to an erection (the penis' itching gets too intense to contiinue with masturbation). also, when slightly erect, it has a tendencey to kind of veer to the left, and    the disinction between the head and shaft seems less apparent, almost as if they are moulding together.i have been tested for all stds and have come up negative...i explained all these problems to a local pharmacist who told me not to worry, that this was all due to some kind of fungal infection. he directedme to apply lamisil on the area twice or once a day for four weeks. i must say that i believe i've noticed some improvement (the itching has ceased), but i still can't help but worry and am wondering if more drastic measures are needed. the penis still has no problem with its basic functions, i.e. urinating and ejaculating (which i've all but ceased anyway due to problems detailed in above). can anyone help, or has anyone had a similar experience? i'm reluctant to go to a doctor.thanks!
677,i have a severe problem with profuse sweating...i have had it for as long as i can remember...i can't keep my hair dry..my face is wet and dripping with sweat it's very embarrasing and disabeling.    i can walk from my front door to the car and my face is sweating like i had ran a marathon...i can't go on like this i need suggestions please.    i am 56 weight about 230 and in good health otherwise.    i take asthma medication singular and abluteral inhaler as needed.    is there a medication i can take or a surgery? i can't stand this any longer it's living hell.    i don't mean to sound so desperate but it's horrible to live like this i cry about it and stay so miserable. it can be below zero outside and i sweat...if i just sweep the floor i get so hot i have to take a break to cool down...the smallest amount of exercise makes me sweat badly. sweat pours from my face, my back my clothes stick to me and my makeup runs off. ,my hair is wet...my face gets blood red and i'm just miserable daily.    is there an answer i would really appreciate some help.    thank you
678,everything went perfect. i thought i was going to die until the ultrasound lady came out and got me to get it started, it was the longest wait of my life. there was a little fetal pole and yolk sack. i am measuring 6 weeks 5 days. i thought i was 7 weeks 2 days, but who knows, the heart was beating at 126 bpm!!! yay!!!is it normal at 6 weeks 5 days for it to still be a fetal pole and yolk sack? also, my doctor is having me come in 2 weeks for another us but she just wanted to do it to look at a small cyst on my ovary and because she knows i get nervous easy and since i don't see her for 4 weeks she wanted to help pass the time. at least that's what i'm hoping. also they let me go home with pics, and i figured if they thought something wasn't right they wouldn't have given me pics, right?? what do you think?
679,for now.the problem is: the trend is getting worse, not better.    those 1,463 indicate a growing anger.    each of those 1,463 represents not a statistic, but a person.they represent, too, a sign of fear.    americans increasingly read reports of rise in home-based islamic extremism; they encounter news features on somali-americans who train in somalia for jihad; and from this, they have come to fear their lives and principles will be challenged.and why not? it  s happened already in europe, where, for instance, the dutch national railroad has stopped giving christmas parties for fear of   offending non-christians      aka, muslims. (jews are not part of this equation.) a few years ago, construction workers in a largely muslim neighborhood in the netherlands worked through a heat wave in shorts and tee-shirts until muslims living there complained; from then on, despite the oppressive heat, they were obliged to don long pants and long sleeves.but this, i think (as did the dutch) is taking accommodation way too far. it is, as it were, rome changing for the milanese.    inevitably, such efforts then result in anti-islam backlash    both in europe and, now, here at home.and so the tensions grow.i have no definitive solution here to offer.    but i do know that we have an opportunity to learn from europe  s errors    and learn from them, we must.    we, as non-muslims, need to learn what islam is    and isn  t; to know what matters in the faith, and respect it; and know what doesn  t    -and refuse to be abused. and we must demand that muslims do the same. america is not, and must never become, an islamic country. but it also must not become a land of hate.    as we stand to protect our lives and the values that define them, this is what will matter most.http://blogs.forbes.com/abigailesman/2010/09/27/can-america-meet-the-challenge-of-muslim-integration/

683,guess i will be starting the new year with a clean slate...i wish she would have stayed away, though :-(happy new year, everyone!
684,i am not posting this article in its entirety because it is simply too long. but in the aftermath of the disastor we do need to remember the victims who lost their lives and their families. these people were just trying to make a living and due to unadulterated greed have lost their lives in the process. my heart and prayers go out to each and every one of them.families of oil rig victims struggle with a devastating lossby lonnae o'neal parkertuesday, may 18, 2010eunice, la. -- keith jones lingered outside the imposing doors of st. anthony's catholic church debating whether to step into the memorial service inside. earlier, back at the funeral home, jones had introduced himself to the family of blair manuel, one of the 11 victims of the oil rig explosion in the gulf of mexico last month.in all his grief, jones feels a particular sadness for how little notice seems to have been given to the oil-rig dead. the coal-mine explosion -- all the attention was on the victims, he said. the president went to visit. the president came down here, and nobody ever even asked him a question about the victims.this story*the oil rig's forgotten few*oil rig explosion claimed 11 lives; their families cope with grief and seek answers*lost oilmenjones, 58, who drank for 21 years and has been sober for 19, said he went 25 years of his life without crying about anything. he broke his right arm and almost all the bones in his face in a 1983 car wreck and didn't cry. then his marriage ended, family relationships got difficult, and when he did start to cry, gordon was always there. his lip began to quiver. he heard about the explosion on the news and e-mailed his son: i hear there's a fire on a rig. just making sure it's not you.two days later, five company representatives came to tell the gathered family that gordon had last been seen on the drill floor. he had been scheduled to start his shift later that night, but told another rig worker, i've got this, go on up to bed. that worker came by the same day to say gordon had saved his life.gordon always signed cards to his grandmother your favorite grandson, jones remembered. what young man sends cards? but gordon did. the best friend of jones's mama told him, for all these years, i don't think i ever heard winnie say gordon's name without saying 'my sweet gordon,' not gordon, but 'my sweet gordon.' . . . it was like it was one word.he grew quiet. she's taking this hard.the church doors opened and pallbearers came down the stairs carrying a heavy wooden box of blair manuel mementos, destined for the cemetery in lieu of remains.'a family man'down the road from the dixie dandy gas and convenience store in newellton, la., the parking lot to the elementary school was full. assistant police chief clarence hall stood in the street directing traffic. he said the same thing, in the same words, that everyone who knew donald clark says: he was a good man, a family man, a real good asset to the community. any way he could help, he would.he was always gone to work or out there fishing, said latrenna cephus, 36, who knew clark -- a 49-year-old assistant driller, married with four kids -- her whole life. he was strictly a family man. . . . he had a good heart. he's gonna be real missed.sam thomas, whose brother married clark's sister, said he talked to him the day before he went back on the rig for the last time. that day before, we had went fishing. he caught 30 perches. every thursday, clark went bowling with his son. he was a family man and a christian. there wasn't nothing he wouldn't do for you.*the oil rig's forgotten few*oil rig explosion claimed 11 lives; their families cope with grief and seek answers*lost oilmenhe had offered condolences, talked with everyone he wanted to talk with, and now just wanted to get on the road for his hour-and-a-half drive home to baton rouge. it was jones's third memorial in two weeks, counting the one april 26 for gordon, his 28-year-old son. it catches him anew every day -- that he has to learn to live without him.it's unclear what caused the april 20 explosion 42 miles south of new orleans. witnesses describe a loud hiss of gas, a green flash and a fireball that burned for two days, consuming, and sinking, the massive drilling rig. now the world is intensely watching the efforts to stop the spewing oil 5,000 feet below, the politicians debating why and the daily updates on environmental damage.but in a string of towns that ring the gulf, where men leave home for weeks at a time to work good jobs with good benefits miles offshore, the families of the victims struggle, and not just with grief. loved ones are trying to come to terms not just with lives lost, and no bodies to recover, but with what feels like the country's collective skipping from dead to gone. there was no national pause to honor the victims, like the one for the 29 west virginia coal miners who died last month, though both miners and riggers work to fuel the country.with oil still spilling, it seems the main focus is on the massive costs -- in terms of everything but the men who worked to bring it to the surface.i feel terrible for people who make their living on the coastline, but i also think sooner or later the oil will be cleaned up, the shrimp will be back, the oysters will be back, the beaches will be back, jones said. gordon's not gonna be back.remembering gordonthe 11 victims came from 11 different towns and worked for two different companies: transocean, which owned the rig, lost nine workers and will hold a memorial service for all 11 may 25 in jackson, miss. m-i swaco, the rig services company, lost two, jones and manuel. the jones family was visited by swaco representatives.ad_iconfor these families, there is no centrality save the central fact that an explosion on an oil rig blew a hole through their lives. there's no single community to help carry all that grief, as in coal-mining towns. some relatives want to talk about it, some are tired of talking, and some are too shaken or angry to do so. or they've been advised by their lawyers not to say a word. some, like keith jones, are starting to face the everydayness of their loss.mourners outside the visitation for blair manuel, 56, a father of three adult daughters who was engaged to be married in july, wore purple and gold ribbons to commemorate manuel's love of louisiana state university football. the eunice native and former high school offensive guard had been a season ticket-holder.he had been an avid outdoorsman, a hunter and fisherman, said his mother, geneva manuel. one of her son's friends walked up to greet her and her husband, l.d., and as they embraced both men teared up. this has been going on all day, l.d. said. all his friends, working people in the oil business, coming by to pay their respects.as more than 100 mourners gathered at the church a few miles away, keith jones, who heads a law firm, sat in his suv, remembering gordon's memorial. his son never liked his nickname gordo, short for gordon, which he also didn't like. he'd been overweight until the last few months, when he lost 80 pounds by cutting back on the pizza and working out on the rig. he'd finally beaten his big brother, chris, who'd always been a better athlete, in baton rouge's annual fat boy 5k in march, a point chris made in his eulogy. gordon and his wife were parents of a 2-year-old
685,ok, this is kind of difficult to talk about. when i was around 5 or 6 my cousin who is 2 years older than i was used to make me lay down so that he could touch me. he would take me into the trails at my grandparents house so that no one could see. one time he even brought friends. i remember being terrified, and tried to get around going to my grandparents after school. im not sure how many times he did this (i've blocked it out) then one time when he was in 9th or 10th grade (iwas in 7th or 8th) i was babysitting his sister, and he came home. he saw that i was laying with her in bed because she was crying that she missed he mom. he came in and laid on the other side of her. he slowly tried to start feeling his way up my arm and i fianally just got up and left the room. i never told anyone about this and im wondering if i should. im now 27 so this was a long time ago. i dont know if he ever did this to his sister or anyone else. i just dont know what to do.
686,my stomach swells to eight month pregnancy size, i feel braxton-hicks like contractions and my stomach hardens. havent had a period in 3 years and no sex for 1 year, so not pregnant. my stomach is flat normally but every once in awhile bam...and its painful. not constipated so what is it?
687,my periods are always exactly when i expect i should have them and rarely give me any trouble. most of the time i don't get bad cramps (if any at all) and the pms symptoms are usually kept to a minimum. i know what you're probably thinking; what's the problem, then?well my period usually only lasts for a few days. it's fairly light and occasionally will last up to four days. but pretty much all of the time it's only three.i read somewhere that a womans period should averagely be about 2.5 ounces but can vary (with an emphasis on that it can be much more than that). mine seems to be less.i see alot of concerns about periods being too long, but what about 'too' short?i might also add that the gyno mentioned my ovaries being much smaller than he considered to be average. could that have anything to do with it?i guess my main concerns are: is this a sign of something else that could be wrong? and could it have any effect on fertility?i just don't know..?
688,i'm new here and wanted to introduce myself i'm 13 weeks and my due date is april 24 2013 this will be my 2nd child thanks!

692,i have had pretty bad cramps for 5 days now. i was supposed to start my    period on friday, it's now tuesday and still nothing.    i have the cramps like i am on my    period and keep checking    for the bleeding but still nothing.    i don't know whats going and i keep thinking i could be pregnant. but why do i still have the cramps?    i don't have sore breasts or any other symptom, just the bad cramping.
693,during sex my vagina started to burn as if i cut myself. i stopped in the middle cause of the pain it didnt hurt unless i touched it so i was very carefull not to. i figured i had cut myself shaving and i irritated it. but then the itching and burning had gotten worst i went to the doctor and there was no cut or infection found. i got perscribed a antifungis cream but its still an annoying pain, what could it possibly be. btw im a lesbian so i was having sex with a girl when this happened.
694,my son is 3 years and 2 months now and has no interest in potty training! i am going to be having another baby in about 5 months and i want him to be out of diapers! i feel like i have tried everything and nothing is working!    he is a very stubborn boy and very active, please help!!!
695,saturday i had to take ashtyn to urgent care because his ear was tender and he was screaming a lot. well, they told me he had ear infection in both ears and put him on amoxicilin. well, he was not getting any better and he was throwing up everything he was eating so i took him to the ped. she told me that his ear drum has ruptured and put him on a liquid version of the z-pack that adults take. basically a strong antibiotic!so, besides that, he is 6 months old today! we go to the neurpologist on monday (christmas eve) so i will keep you all posted!!!!
696,hey yall hope everyones doing good, i havent posted in a while but i had a question, i had a drs appointment this week and he said im measuring 27 weeks but am only suposed to be 24 weeks but doesnt want to change the due date, is that common?the baby as well as my belly (i cant think of what they call is, the height of your uterus) are both measuring 3 weeks ahead, should i be scared of having a huge baby, or is is common to measure so far ahead of where you should be?another quick question, i can feel the baby at the very bottom near my pelvic area on my left side going all the way up into my ribs on my right side, is she supposed to be that big yet! yikes im just scared shes going to be an abnormally big
697,im 18 years old. i've had my period 4 times this month. i'm not on birth control and my boyfriend and i have been trying to get pregnant .the first time i've had my period this month it was like a normal one and lasted 5 days. then the second one was two weeks later it was normal looking but lighter and more spotting it was 2 days long. then 2 days later i started spotting for a day and it was brown and chunky blood .now its two days later and its started again it brown but not so chunky and i have a irritating feeling almost like a uti but it dose not    hurt when i pee. what could this mean i have no ride to get medical attention and i'm very concerned?
698,i have extreme starbursts around headlights, traffic lights, candles, even christmas lights especially at night, but even somewhat in the daytime.the stars are the color of the light, except if it's a white light -- then they are rainbow. my surgeon says i'll get used to it and they must be pretty.it's not only irritating, but quite dangerous. i can hardly see to drive at night. i'm 48 years old and drive every night.i didn't have cataracts, but high myopia, so i never should have got the crystalenses in the first place. (they don't seem to accommodate much, if at all, anyway.) the claims that these lenses will give you the full range of vision are false, as far as i'm concerned. i should have just kept wearing contact lenses. at least i used to be able to see at night with the contacts.is there any hope to get rid of the stars??
699,hi everyone im new to this community site.well this is 8 days since my et, i'm having mild headache since day 5 and light cramping. this is my 1st ivf have 2 et grade 1 and 2. its good or bad new?
700,i am a 35 yo male, good health, just the noramal htn and lack of exersice...however the other day when putting on deodorant i noticed a painful knot/lump in my left armpit. i didnt mess with it or anything figured it was like an infected folical or something. the next morning i woke up and the lump was still there yet now there was another one bhind my left nipple and this one is very painful. again didnt mess with it just applied heat off and on through out the day. well today i wake up and there are many lups going from my nipple to my armpit and its painful and you can see that my left side is so much more swollen in the breast are compared to the right its red painful to touch and is just getting worse i think. there was no trauma, or broken skin in both areas...oh but yesterday the areola was kinda oozing a clear fluid and was not the best smelling. i am going to try to wait till tomorrow to see my pmd dont need to fill up an er when this is not a life or death issue, just wondering if anyone had thoughts on what this might be. i am not asking for a dx just some thoughts.
701,hey guys, ok so yesterday i went to the emergency room. i was so light headed and vomitting, still bleeding and cramping. [for those who do not know my situation, please read threads a little scared and *update* a little scared. wednesday night was bad for me, after my boyfriend took me home thats when i started bleeding heavier and passing large clots.so i went to the hospital yesterday morning at 8:30am [lol i was in the kid area cuz im under 21 haha] the doctors there did another pelvic exam and another pap [the pap i have to wait 3-5 days for results, but if i dont receive a call then it was ok], they did blood tests and 2 more sonograms [regular and internal].and they did not find anything!! i dont have fibriods, i dont have any tumors or cysts or anything. i know as horrible as it sounds, but i was kinda hoping for atleast 1 cyst so atleast i knew what was causing the bleeding. they think as a possibilty my hormones are slightly out of balance. so after 5 hours in the hospital, i didnt get any answers.so i went to my doctor right after the hospital, he doesnt seem to concerned about it, he says yes it might be my hormones or it could just be a wacky cycle im having. so he is sending me for another blood test to check my hormones and a few other things, which i will do that tommorow morning. and i guess i will go from there.i am still bleeding rather light no clots, my cramps are on and off but then again i am extremly sore down there and it hurts to walk but yet im sitting here typing this at work...lolanyways ladies, i will keep you all updated when i get my results of my blood work. : )~niki~
702,i have had mild cramping since 7dpo but don't expect my period until 13dpo. i have also had mild waves of nausea. i don't usually get cramps until a day or two before af. can these be signs of pregnancy, or is it too early to be feeling these things since i am only still in my tww?
703,i get this stuff in my eyes that i can't get out. it bugs me during the day. it used to not be that bad but now it is stuck at the bottom of my eye and i can't get it out. what should i do? it disturbs me so that i can't read my books.

706,my son has seemed to always have a problem with nose bleeds since he was about 2. i brought this up to his doctor when he was littler and she didn't seem concerned at that point. i think i may need to bring it up again. his nose bleed yesterday for 2 hours, and it was heavy bleeding. we were at a family party and he was just eating dinner when it started to down pour. does anyone have any idea about something that could cause such a problem? we have an inhouse humidifier so the air in the house is not dry.

709,my son is 2 years old and he has practically been sick since birth. he was born with a high respiratory rate and at a month old he was diagnosed with laryngomalacia and acid reflux. he also has asthma. he has had croup 10 times since birth, pneumonia 8 times, and many other viral & bacterial infections. he has also had many ear infections. recently he has had diarrhea since april 21st and a stool sample done that came up negative. when he gets sick, his breath smells like aerosol or something. we moved to another home because we thought where we used to live was making him sick but it hasn't helped. could his tonsils have anything to do with this or what could be causing this?

715,i had went in to be assessed for the flu.    i did not want to take anything if i could be pregnant.    my last period was feb. 2nd-4th.    at the time of the appointment, it would have been 5 weeks since my period.    i am not sure when i ovulated.    i took digital ovulation tests from days 11-18.    i never got a surge but did not continue to test after this point...too expensive!    i could have ovulated after day 18,    cycles run avg. 28-30d.    anyways, all urine tests have been negative.    dr. drew a blood hcg that day.    it came back 3.    he told me there is no pregnancy.    however, i have gained 5lbs, slight nausea at times, breast tenderness, and abdomen feels very bloated.    could i still be pregnant but, at this point, have a severely low hcg.    i have had friends whose levels were low and urine tests did not confirm until 7-14 weeks...i want to be patient and see what happens.    so far, today is day 39 past lmp.    has anyone had this story or am i just fooling myself?

724,my husband had surgery as a toddler for removal of congenital cataracts.    the last time had glasses made they were unacceptable.    he was told that it was because few dispensaries know how to make these lenses for people that do not have the lens implants that they now do.     any suggestions on where to find eye care and have his lenses made?    (we live in the washington dc area).thanks in advance.
725,i have read a lot of the answers on the website, but i am absolutely paranoid about an hiv infection.    i was very drunk one night and had sex with a woman i don't know.    she gave me unprotected oral sex, then we used a condom for intercourse.    however, i believe the condom may have fallen off.    the next day i noticed a small scrape/cut on my penis.    the girl says she is healthy, but i can't be sure.    i am really stressed out by this and i know my chances are slim, but any reassurance would be appreciated.

727,http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/the-exchange/part-timers-losing-healthcare-insurance-may-want-thank-210354500.htmlhow terrible. home depot (hd) and trader joe  s have decided to stop offering health insurance for part-time employees, moving them over to obamacare instead. more companies seem sure to follow. and more wailing about greedy, heartless corporations is sure to follow that. some workers may start to drop dead from sheer anxiety before obamacare even goes into effect on january 1.once the new health law has been in place for a few months, however, part-time america may issue a collective sigh of relief. nobody ever held up today  s part-time mini-med plans as model coverage. the majority of part-time workers don  t even get health insurance, and those who do typically get diluted plans with limited benefits they still have to pay something for.   you have to question whether that  s really insurance,   says paul fronstin, director of the health research program at the employee benefits research institute.   they may not cover prescription drugs, and if you get cancer or end up in the hospital, they probably won  t help you a whole lot.  insurance offered under the affordable care act, by contrast, could end up being a much better deal. obamacare is complicated, and it will require many people to do detailed research on their insurance options instead of having an employer do it for them. there have also been elaborate efforts by foes of the program to depict it as the ruination of everything. so it  s not surprising that part-timers being told their employer is cutting them loose and sending them over to obamacare are a little jumpy.actually enrolling could calm them down, however. obamacare was designed to make decent health insurance affordable for people who otherwise can  t afford it, and whether you love or hate the program, it seems likely to succeed at that basic mission. that  s because the program subsidizes the cost of insurance based on your income, with the largest subsidies going to those with the lowest incomes.lots of confusionthere are many insurance choices under obamacare that vary by state and apply to different income levels, which adds to the confusion. but the nonprofit kaiser family foundation has built a helpful calculator that lets you enter your income and a few other basic details to get an idea of how much insurance would cost you under the program.a single parent with three kids and an annual income of $25,000, for instance, could get an $8,800 insurance plan for a total out-of-pocket cost of $500 per year. subsidies, in other words, cover 94% of the cost. try to beat that on part-time pay.a two-parent family with two kids and a $50,000 income could get a $10,000 plan for $3,365, with subsidies covering 66% of the cost. there  s one catch: you only qualify for such deals if you  re not able to get coverage through your employer. so if you  re a part-timer whose company canceled your watered-down insurance coverage, it may have actually done you a favor.trader joe  s is one employer known for offering generous health care benefits, even for part-timers (until now). but even those workers could end up better off under obamacare. in an internal email published by the washington post, a trader joe  s exec provided some calculations for a part-time employee who earns about $24,000 per year and has been paying about $167 per month as her share of a trader joe  s policy similar to a   silver   plan under the aca. if she enrolls in obamacare, the subsidized cost would fall to about $70 per month for nearly identical coverage. and that  s before a $500 annual stipend trader joe  s plan to offer part-timers to help them pay for insurance.some will pay morewithout a doubt, there will be some people who end up paying more for insurance as their employers offer less. mostly, they will be higher-income workers who lose employer-provided coverage and have to buy it through obamacare. subsidies are phased out at 400% of the poverty line, which this year is $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of 4. above that, people have to pay the full cost of coverage.other companies have been changing their health care coverage in ways that sound like they  re related to obamacare but aren  t. walgreens (wag), for instance, will begin requiring employees to choose an insurance plan from a private   exchange   that offers at least 25 choices, instead of the three or four walgreen  s has been offering. the concept is similar to the public exchanges that will be up and running under obamacare, beginning october 1, with coverage beginning january 1. but the government plays no role and offers no subsidies in the exchange walgreen  s is joining.walgreen  s will still bear much of the cost of its employees   coverage, through fixed stipends it grants employees to help pay for care. but workers will now have to educate themselves more, choose coverage from a wide range of options, and pay the difference if they choose cadillac coverage that costs more than the subsidy covers. the idea is to give employees a stronger incentive to control health care spending, by requiring them to pay more of their own money as costs rise.ibm (ibm), time-warner (twx) and general electric (ge) have enacted similar plans for retirees, and companies in general are getting more aggressive about finding new ways to control health care spending as it become more and more of a burden. obamacare may be part of the solution, but many companies would be doing this even without the health reform law. if the scaremongering over obamacare ever stops, weathering changes in health care benefits may no longer require hypertension medication.
728,i dont know whats going on with my body right now. ah, my period was due the sixth but i got it the 3rd it was light but today it just turned dark and heavy... but its kind of off and on... not like normal ... because normally im heavy from start to finish..and its last 6 days... so far its 3......can i still be pregnant or... bleh
729,i've been working a lot, and honestly, i've been eating even more poorly than i usually do, and getting very little sleep. monday night i felt like i was coming down with a cold. tuesday morning i had really bad diarrhea all day, was nauseated beyond belief, and really weak and tired. i got some pepto bismol. yesterday i felt a bit better, the diarrhea seemed to be gone, and i ate last night before bed, which was probably a bad idea. now this morning, the diarrhea is back, and on top of it, acid reflex which i keep burping, and can taste last nights dinner and then feeling like it's gonna come back up. more than once the nausea has resurfaced, and i've had to stay close to the bathroom. others have asked me about possible pregnancy, which... well, i haven't had a real period since december 2008. and even the slight periods i have had, haven't surfaced since march.any ideas? i can't go to the doctors right now due to some mix up with my medical insurance.

732,i am 35 years old, have two children, but my husband wants a third (he is almost 40). i had a 4 cm uterine submucosal fibroid close to my cercix. my fourth doctor tried to remove through the cervix (hysteroscopy myomectomy), but was only able to remove 75% of fibroid because of difficult location -- last year. it has regrown to 4 cm. my fifth doctor wants to do a laproscopy hysterectomy. he says the fibroid is too low next to bladder to try for a abdominal myomectomy.    my husband does not want me to have a hysterectomy. what should i do?
733,i can personally attest to symptoms of vitamin d deficiency.    i was recently tested after 6 months of pain and doctors looking at me like, we don't know, until i found a qualified doctor who performed the proper tests.    my levels are11.8 ng/ml.    i have seen sites that call this moderate and others that call it severe.    the current recommendations refer to this as severe deficiency.    i agree with that finding considering the symptoms i exhibited which were the following:exacerbation of carpal tunnel syndromeparesthesias (burning) in fingers and toesbilateral arthritis pain so bad in fingers that i would wake up with both hands in a fist and want to curl in on myself.bilateral arthritis pain in hips so that just laying on my side would make them ache.    it also felt like they were frozen in place.symptoms which may be related to vitamin d but i'm not sure since i am awaiting the doctor's call as to whether the vitamin d deficiency is primary or secondary are:raynaud's phenomenon (cold fingers and toes)    my hands go white and are generally cold all day long except when i'm running them under hot water and then they go bright red but it does feel so good when they warm up.    whether or not this is related to the vitamin d i'm not sure because i'm awaiting the doctor's call in regards to whether the deficiency is primary or secondary.burning behind the left scapula toward the middle which caused pain that radiated down the back of my arm, especially when looking down, similar to trousseau's phenomenon and may be trousseau's since it did bother my carpal tunnel.also known as trousseau's sign.description:carpal spasms and paraesthesia produced by pressure upon nerves and vessels of the upper arm sufficient to stop the circulation. the result is a sudden contraction of the fingers and hand into the so-called obstetrical position. it is indicative of latent tetany. also occurs in osteomalacia. (osteomalacia is caused by severe vitamin d deficiency)gout or pseudogout.    my right toe and footpad below the toe have been swelling off and on since may.    this makes it difficult to walk for any length of time unless i want to deal with the pain which i usually can deal with if i feel like it but it's not fun.pseudogout is suggested when abnormal calcifications are seen in the cartilage of joints on x-ray testing. these calcifications are referred to as chondrocalcinosis.    (which happens in osteoarthritis)sitting straight up on my tailbone also hurt for quite some time, although that did resolve but possibly because i sat with terrible posture to alleviate the pain so my bad posture may have alleviated that pain.i started with gerd as well around the same time as all of these other things and oddly enough all of this was precipitated by a case of mononucleosis so much of it was passed off by the doctors as results of the mono and when it persisted they just shrugged.    well the gerd medicine can inhibit the aborption of calcium.    not sure how it affects vitamin d but i do know that i could not eat during the mono and lost 10 pounds in two weeks and then continued to have eating difficulty due to the gerd so maybe that is why the vitamin d became deficient, who knows.    i suspect that my low levels of vitamin d may have caused the gerd and possibly allowed the mono to creep in since it will inhibit your immune reaction as well.    but i haven't found anything on line to state that vitamin d deficiency can cause gerd but one can wish can't they?    that would be an easier fix at least.    i'm 124 pounds and 5'4 so neither obese or anorexic and everything else checked out except for my growth hormone values which are slightly elevated.i remember saying when it was at the worst that i just felt like an old person.    i turned 40 this year and thought wow, 40 does suck!    i actually thought that maybe you do fall apart at 40 and it's all downhill from there except that everyone around me 40 and up didn't seem to be that bad.this discussion is related tovitamin d deficiency.

737,i am going to get a blood test tomorrow afternoon at the clinic to confirm if i am pregnant or not because on september 4th i had unprotected sex several times and again last night several times. i am about a month late on getting my depo shot and we didnt use any other form of birth control. i know it was a stupid mistake but i really just need advice not judgement. my mom is making me take a blood test tomorrow and i know if i got pregnant last night or my body is in the process that it wont show up. but if i happend to have got pregnant about 22 days ago would that be enough time to show positive on a blood test? i am terrified because she is threatening me with another shot of depo and i dont want to get it and than loose my pregnancy because i tested too early. i am completely on my own about this too. my boyfriend left me because of major trust issues in our relationship, he wont even speak to me or look at me. he says he will never forgive me for the thing i did and wont evertalk to me again. that all happend this morning. anyway i am only concerned at the moment about me and this situation. i need to know what i should do....what do i tell the doctor so that i can buy me some more time to wait til i can for sure get a positive blood test. i dont want to kill my baby or what would be a baby, and my mom said that if i am pregnant i have to take the morning after pill but thats against what i believe. i am so trapped and scared and confused and heartbroken. first of all i love my ex so much with all i have and hes completely cutting me out of his life. i know he has been so hateful to me during out relationship but i also lied so i feel i am responsible. but thats another problem. i just feel completely drained. i need help.

754,i had 3 5 day blasctocysts transferred last thursday and yesterday i had this needle like tingling sensation all over my abdomen for about 5 minutes while i was lying in bed, is this normal????
755,hello, thank you for reading and answering my questions.i am 34 years old.    in my early to mid twenties, i took ortho tri cyclen for birth control.    in my late twenties, i was told by my physician to stop because she had discovered that i have lupus.    i was told that bc pills can negatively affect an autoimmune disease because of the hormones.    for about 6 or 7 years now, i have used condoms to prevent pregnancy.also, until about a month and a half ago, i have never taken vitamins or supplements.    i started taking a b complex vitamin and a 5 htp supplement.    i've done very well with them and can tell a difference in my energy.recently, i was told that i absolutely do not have lupus, and that it is probably fibromyalgia.    my gyno said it was safe to return to ortho tri cylcen, but gave me the lo version.    i was on it for only six days when i started developing these symptoms:i developed nausea that lasted about 24 hours during which i did vomit once.right before i vomited, i felt a quick wave of escalating heat come over me that didn't subside until a few minutes after vomiting.i believe it is important to note that this nausea and vomiting felt totally unlike any type of virus, it felt different and very, very strange.i cried for hours afterward because i couldn't stand feeling like this.i stopped the pills that saturday, the sixth day, and spoke to my gyno on monday.    she said to stop completely and we could try something different after my next period.    but she didn't give me any explanations as this was a quick telephone call.right around the time i started this birth control, i also switched my vitamins.    i stopped the b complex, and started a multi vitamin that included the same amount of b complex, plus, obviously, lots of everything else.i've been off the birth control for about 5 days, and i have been on the multi vitamin for about a week and a half.last night, i woke up as the same quick wave of heat was coming over me.    i could feel it passing over my body and i could feel my temperature rise.    everything i've read about a menopausal hot flash seems to fit what i felt.i had the same nausea and vomited within a few minutes.    it felt the same as before as well.just like before, i returned back to normal after having vomited.so, my questions are:do you think i'm actually experiencing hot flashes?    i'm only 34.are they related to the birth control and/or the multi vitamin?can a birth control pill trigger pre-menopause?is there a relation between a possible auto immune disease and these types of symptoms while on bc?can multi vitamins make a person nauseous?do you think the bc and/or the multi vitamin, or the combination of them, is causing the symptoms i'm having?most importantly,when will this go away if it's related to the bc?    i don't know how much longer i can endure this.    shouldn't the pills be out of my system by now?again, thank you for taking time to read and answer.    i appreciate it. f
756,i have done more research and am fairy certain i injured myself from masturbation.    i do not use lube at all and the most i have ever done it is twice a week.    i have been tested for infections and they all came back negative.    i am wondering what would help sooth the itch on the urethra?    could i apply some jock itch cream on my penis and hope it absorbs into the urethra or atleast into the skin far enough to relieve the itch?    i am not sure what over the counter cream is safe and effective.    i doubt it is jock itch since i have no rash anywhere, just an itchy sensation inside my penis, but i am up for trying any type of cream to put there to relieve the itch.    would an ice pack help, what about warm baths?    how long does it take to heal on its own?    thanks for any opinions.

761,i jsut got back from my doctor's appointment.    i am 33 weeks, 3 days.    my doctor is all about scheduled inductions.    i have mixed feelings.    i have a three year old that is very concerned about me going to the hospital and all of my family is 2 hours away.    so, it would be great to know exactly when my baby is coming and make arrangements for my son.    i was given pitocin with him b/c my water broke, but no contractions began.    it wasn't that bad.    my labor lasted 12 hours, but 3.5 of those were spent pushing.    however, i have heard horror stories about inductions lasting for 20+ hours and i don't want that.    anyway, i go back to the doctor in 2 weeks and he said we could discuss it further and look at dates.    he said he would be comfortable inducing anytime after 38 weeks which is around august 12.    what are you opinions about induction?
762,i sometimes feel like my body reacts poorly to personal lubricants ( silicone or water based) i often get yeast infections (possibly from them) i'm looking for a natural approach. i read somewhere that coconut oil makes for a good personal lubricant partly due to it's anti-fungal properties, is this true? is it safe to use organic coconut oil as a personal lubricant during intercourse?thanks for your response :)

764,i had a total hysterectomy in 1997 age 26 after having severe lower right abdominal pain from ovarian cysts and endometriosis. i was more or less told i would be skipping through the daisies with joy afterwards. reality was it was the worst mistake i ever made. after surgery 2 idiotic nurses tore the dressing off my wound. it should have been soaked off in a bath of warm water. the result was that on my right side the incision was pulled open and during the week i was in hospital the wound was left gaping open. on leaving hospital i arranged a home nurse to come in and she was horrified. she said it needed packing and would never heal if left open. she had to pack it twice a week for nearly a month. hrt was stopped when the patches gave me a rash and my dr would not change it. over the years my weight shot up, i had severe hip and buttock pain, sciatica, lower back pain and aching joints and palpitations and feelings of lightheadedness and weird spaced out feelings. 5 years ago i lost a lot of weight to try and cure my back pain but it got worse. then one day i collapsed with excruciating lower right pain but at the hospital it suddenly stopped like flicking a switch. i was told it was probably gas. the pain did not come back for 5 months and back in hospital again i was told it was prob adhesions and i should get a hobby and learn to live with it. for the past year the pain had died away but a couple of days ago it was back with a vengeance. on top of that i have a weird feeling in my stomach like period pains as well as this right sided pain and a feeling of fullness in my bowel which is relieved for a short time by going to the bathroom usually 4-5 times a day. this is the longest the pain has lasted and i just want to know what is wrong with me and be believed.

774,i'm really sorry to post this, but i'm worried that i'm not normal down there. i've looked through a lot of pictures to find something that at least sort of looks like me but i've found nothing. i've never had sex or anything like that. never down there unless i'm in the shower for general hygeine. i have a boyfriend but we don't do anything. partly because i don't want any of that til after marriage, and partly because i'm afarid i'm abnormal.from what i've seen online, i don't think i have much of a labia minor, very small, that seem like they're attached to the clit... nothing really opens up that much, like i've seen in pictures/videos. it's just all right there, closed up and odd. i find it all a bit uncomfortable to touch.is this all normal from what you know?i have pictures, but i'm reluctant to show them or freak anyone out. if anyone doesn't mind taking a look, can someone tell me from a picture if it's normal (or just from what i've described?) i can't go to a doctor because i can't afford one, and even if i could, i've been told that they place their fingers up there and i'm afraid that'd hurt or they'd break something.i just want to feel normal. does this sound normal?
775,http://beta.news.yahoo.com/obamas-signature-real-autopenned-122724800.htmlwashington (ap)    it's the open secret that nobody in government wants to talk about: that cherished presidential signature that's tucked away in a scrapbook or framed for all to see might never have passed under the president's hand.for decades, presidents of both parties have let an autopen do some of the heavy lifting when it comes to scrawling their signatures. the machine was recently put to use signing a bill into law, apparently a first.overseas and out of reach when lawmakers passed an extension of certain provisions of the patriot act, president barack obama employed the autopen to sign it, a step the white house has been mum about ever since.i always heard the autopen was the second most guarded thing in the white house after the president, says jack shock, who had permission to wield former president bill clinton's autopen as his director of presidential letters and messages.jim cicconi, who oversaw the use of autopens for president george h.w. bush, recalls that the plastic signature templates for the machines    yes, there was more than one autopen    would wear out from repeated use.ronald reagan had 22 different signature templates, including ron, ''dutch and other iterations, to boost the aura of authenticity surrounding his fake signatures, says stephen koschal, an autograph authenticator who two years ago published a guide to presidential autopen signatures.it's not just ordinary americans who get the autopen treatment.koschal says he once visited vice president dan quayle's office in the capitol and spotted a signed photograph from the first president bush that he said had clearly been autopenned.obama took the presidential autopen out of the closet and into a new realm.while traveling in europe last month, obama directed his staff in washington to use an autopen to sign into law an extension of certain patriot act powers to fight terrorism. the legislation had been approved by congress at the last minute, and there was no time to fly it to france for obama's signature before the anti-terrorism powers expired.it was believed to be the first time a president has used an autopen to sign legislation, and that didn't sit well with a number of republicans. twenty-one gop house members sent obama a letter on june 17 asking him to re-sign the legislation with his actual signature because use of the autopen appears contrary to the constitution.obama's team relied on a 29-page legal analysis crafted during the administration of president george w. bush to argue that the faux signature passed constitutional muster.ari fleischer, white house press secretary under the younger bush, says the bush white house had considered using the autopen to sign a minor piece of legislation as a test case, but in the end bush just kept signing the parchment himself. bush used the autopen for routine correspondence and photos but not on matters of importance, fleischer said.while a number of white house aides from administrations past were willing to discuss the presidential autopen, that kind of talk is frowned upon while a president is in office.you want to preserve the president's semblance of reaching out and being connected, says shock. but the cold hard facts are that when you get 10,000 letters a day he can't possibly handle all that kind of correspondence himself.it turns out there are varying levels of fakeness in presidential signatures.there are preapproved form letters with digital signatures. there are preprinted cards for birthdays and other special events. autopen signatures generally are reserved for more personalized correspondence that doesn't score a real signature, say officials from administrations past.obama's staff is loath to talk about his use of the autopen.the president prefers to keep the focus on the sampling of 10 letters a day that he reads from among the tens of thousands that ordinary people send to the white house. in many cases, he writes back to these people, with his own signature.but the president couldn't get around explaining how the patriot act got signed into law without briefly shining a spotlight on the autopen. once that news was out, though, the white house clammed up. it declined to provide any further details about how many autopens the administration uses, what they look like, where they're kept, or who makes the machine.and don't ask bob olding, whose company is the leading manufacturer of autopens, to discuss his clientele.i'm not going to help you, he said. our customers do not want anyone else knowing they have these machines.olding did reveal, though, that when there's a major change in government, we get an uptick in business.olding is president of rockville, md.-based damilic corp., whose signature machines run from $2,000 up to $10,000. hulking older versions look like a drafting table and are too big to fit through a doorway. newer models, with microprocessors and digital controls, sit on a tabletop. but they still feature two mechanical arms that move a pen back and forth, up and down.the machines sign letters at about the same pace as does the human hand. an autopen machine that automatically signs a stack of documents can spit out roughly 500 signatures an hour; those with manual document feeders, about 200 an hour.as recently as the second bush administration, the autopen in use was a large piece of furniture that looked like a drafting table, says heidi smith, who served as bush's correspondence director for two years. she says those with clearance to use the autopen would head over to the executive clerk's office in the eisenhower executive office building, next to the white house, where the autopen wielded bush's pen of choice    a sharpie.autopens have been used by presidents since dwight eisenhower, says koschal, and president john f. kennedy put them to heavy use. many presidents have had secretaries sign their names to correspondence and documents, he says.more than 200 years ago, thomas jefferson acquired a mechanical copying device called a polygraph that attached to his pen and made a second copy of what he was writing. jefferson liked it so much he wrote that i could not, now therefore, live without the polygraph.it's not just busy presidents who rely on autopens. they're used by thousands of organizations, companies and government officials.donald h. rumsfeld got in hot water for using one as defense secretary to sign letters of condolence to the families of u.s. troops killed in action. when word leaked out in 2004, rumsfeld said he'd done it to ensure expeditious contact with grieving family members.i have directed that in the future i sign each letter, he said.other officials and candidates have fingered the autopen as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for documents that appeared to bear their names. one was enron executive kenneth lay, who was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and lying to banks despite his lawyers' arguments that he shouldn't be held accountable for documents signed by autopen. his conviction was later vacated on other grounds.so how to tell the difference between a real signature and an autopen version?koschal says the best way to detect a fake is to lay the signature in question over a known autopen version and hold the two documents up to a light. if they're exactly the same, chances are that the top one was created with an autopen. but presidents often create multiple autopen signatures to make it less obvious when they're letting a machine do the work.as for obama's autopen signature on the extension of patriot act powers, it may pass the constitutional test, but not koschal's.i'd pay peanuts for it, the autograph authenticator said. it's not a real signature.
776,my 5 year old son just couple of days ago started showing signs of 'ocd ' (touching something too many times with hands or feet, pulling his t-shirt down because it's bothering him around the neck, tapping with his foot on the ground while walking, etc).    one of the stressors may be his extreme jealousy of his younger sibling, or my constant reminders to play nicely, both with his borther and other kids.    he has a tendency not to keep hands to himself...otherwise, he is out of kindergarten for the summer (where academically he does fairly well), so he tends to have pretty relaxed days (apart from swimming lessons on most aftrenoons).    both me and my husband are prone to anxiety but have never been diagnosed or on meds.

780,im 27 and gave one vaginal birth and have had the same sexual partner for a few years. well i am currently menstrating and was in the shower cleaning and found two small semi hard bumps on the outside of my cervix. i have never had an std or an abnormal pap. so i guess my question is are these bumps normal while you are menstrating. will they subside or should i call my obgyn?
781,when i pull my foreskin back, there is skin underneath the corona of the glans(glands)penis.    my glans(glands)is also hypersensitive.    when i get the most erect, it feels like skin is tugging somewhere and it's somewhat painful.    i've been touching it a lot to desensitize the glans(glands), but what is that skin under the corona?
782,i am on my first cycle of clomid, i started taking it on day 2, my periods are between 26-28 days in cycle. i am on day 34 and no eriod, i have done 3 pregnancy tests and all are negative. is it usual for clomid to delay the start of period, it is driving me mad as i am just waiting.

784,my soon to be five year old is still behaving like a toddler in school.    he will often go down on his hands and knees and crawl into class, he has poor fine motor skills and is very tactile, he refuses to go willingly to activities and he sometimes has huge tantrums.    he is a very bright boy, the youngest of three and i thought that school would be a breeze for him.    the school head teacher called him a troubled child and has expressed concerns about him.    he was assessed by a special needs teacher and she said that he is emotionally very young but cognitively very bright.does anyone know why it is taking him so long to mature and is it normal for a five year to be so emotionally young?
785,i had sex on 10th of this month and i ovulated on the 12th. every since that day my breast has become really sore and why is this ?
786,where to begin?    well, my husband and i have been seperated since april, and we have yet to get back together..the seperation was his idea.    we have 2 children ages 7 and 2 and since our seperation the kids have been juggled from one house to another..he lives with his parents and i live with my dad.    we seperated for many reasons, but the main 2 reasons we seperated was finances and the way that he treated me compared to his family.    my husband is 2 years younger than i am, i'm 27 and he's 25.    he has always been a very family oriented person, and i don't mean with me and my kids, but i'm talking about with his mom, dad and sisters.    he constanly would put them before me and never really considered how i felt about it.    a few months after we seperated, we started trying to work things out and things seemed to have been going a lot better for us, he was working on his issues and i was working on mine.    over the past few months i have been really pushing for us to get a house together and become a family again so that our kids can have stability, and he agrees with me, tells me that he loves me and that he wants our marriage to work, but then once the conversation takes place that specific day, nothing ever gets mentioned about it again.    about a month ago, my mother passed away at the age of 46 unexpectedly, very tragic on me and my family.    my husband was semi-supportive for a few days after it happened, but once the funeral was over with he went back to his normal life and never really seemed to care about what i was and still am going through.    my husband is 25, lives with his parents, doesn't have to pay any bills and just works odd jobs here and there to have money.    i keep pushing him to get a job so that we can potentialy buy a house in the near future, but it's like i am talking to a brick wall.    i have been so sad and depressed about what has happened with my mother, and the fact that my husband is not being very supportive makes me feel very lonely.    he goes days at a time without even speaking to me, and then calls me or let me rephrase that, he texts me and acts like everything is great.    i have recently started counseling to help me deal with not only my mothers death but with my marriage issues.    i am at a point to where i can't take much more, and i really don't know what to do anymore.    my husband tells me that he loves me, but he really hasn't shown me over the past few months that he gives a rats a** about me.    i don't want my kids to continue in the chaos of our seperation, but i really don't know what to do anymore.    i truly do love him, but i feel like i am the only one who really cares. please any advice would help.

788,my cycle is 28-30 days every month.    well, last month i was having a lot of cm with a yellow tint about 3 days after my af ended.    i went to the dr.'s because i thought i had an infection.    he told me that i did have the beginnings of a yeast infection, but that wouldn't cause the yellow cm. appartently i was also ovulating.    i told him that can't be right because it's very early, so the dr. showed me the cells under the microscope    he also said it's probably a mix of the blood and the cm mixing togeather to cause the yellow tint.    i did end up getting my af a week early last month. this month i ended my af a couple of days ago and the same thing is happening.    i have a lot of cm with a yellow tint.    i can not believe this.    am i ovulating a week early again?    has anyone had a yellow tint of cm while ovulating?    why am i ovulating early 2 months in a row???.
789,i have a 3 yr old son,that seems to be a little crazy.he will run from one side of the room to the other,over and over.slamming into each wall.he had knocked his self flat on his back before.he will get hurt and it won't even phase him.he ran into a corner of a table a couple of weeks ago,and knocked a hole in his lip.he got up and kept running.i had to hold him down to look at it and try to doctor it.he has knocked my front tooth out with his head.he was having a fit in walmart and i picked him up to take him to the van,he bucked his head back and knocked it right out.once again,did not phase him.hurt me..he is really smart,he can remember words to songs,he knows all his letter and a lot of his numbers.if you show him a pic of something,he can almost always tell you what it is.he has a high level of understandng.he only has to see somethng once.now i have a 19 yr old son that had add,but he didnt act like this.i have a 10 yr old that has no add of any form.i am just wondering if maybe he has something diffrent.he isnt a mean kid.he is really sweet,most of the time.he is just bad too.any thoughts on this.thanks

793,what do you think of this article?_________________i live in los angeles, which may well be ground zero for spiritual movements in the united states. many such groups got their start here, and the diversity of faiths and movements is impressive - from old to new, from sincere to shady, from truly elevating to downright toxic.people engage in all manner of practice here -- singing, chanting, doing yoga, donning exotic clothes, and sometimes even going so far as changing their names or, even more drastic, getting tattoos. for the new seeker, the variety can be bewildering; to the skeptic, proof of frivolity. they can't all possibly matter, and they can't all be right at the same time now, can they?faced with all these choices, spirituality can be a daunting concept. what does it really mean to be spiritual? a hundred people will respond a hundred different ways, so i won't pretend to have the universal answer. what i can tell you is what spirituality means to me. it comes down to five simple principles:1) be the best possible version of you.from the day you're born, your days on this planet are numbered. at this rate, i'm guessing i've got 22,000 more to go. the good news is that during this time, there's nothing holding you back from striving for excellence in every endeavor you undertake. so give your best in your work and your friendships and infuse it all with love.so you have this extraordinary opportunity to develop your talents in all kinds of spheres. got a knack for cooking? pick up a cookbook and start experimenting on your friends at dinner parties. have an ear for music? noodle on a guitar and learn some chords. good at languages? listen to some audio courses and say get me a beer in 24 tongues.some of these skills will be more fun and others will be more useful. arguably, the most rewarding skills will be those that end up enriching the lives of those around you as well as your own. which brings us to the second point.2) treat others exceptionally well.the essence of spirituality is realizing that at the very bottom, all humans are much more similar than different. therefore spirituality is not about trappings, conventions, rituals or adherence to doctrine. it's simply about how well you treat others.so if you think that those with a different creed or costume are not deserving of your compassion, then you're not really spiritual, regardless of how much prayer or meditation you put in. but if you're an atheist who's a source of elevation and enrichment to all those around you - hate to break it to you, but you're spiritual.spirituality manifests in action, so let go of dogma and ritual. instead, resolve to treat people exceptionally well. that is the essence of compassion.3) practice enlightened self-interest.i've observed that when you act at all times with your long-term self-interest in mind, you usually ends up taking the most compassionate course of action. i call this the 'long-now' mindset; in fact, there's a whole group of forward thinkers in san francisco dedicated to this way of thinking, the long now foundation.let me illustrate with an example. let's say you want to buy a car. you may think, well, i like big cars, so i'm gonna get me one of these bigass suvs. that's super short-term thinking. then you think, hmm, gas prices are only going to rise, so maybe i should get a smaller car. that's longer term. then: y'know, if i'm going to have kids some day and don't want their school to be under water, maybe i should do my part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. i'll get a hybrid. by thinking about your self-interest a generation or two down the road, you end up doing the 'compassionate' thing.taoist thought is suspicious about taking actions because they're good or noble - it's all about practicality. that's what i like about long-now thinking: it's less about being nice than it is about being smart.4) think independently of circumstancenewsflash: today, you are not just homo sapiens, or thinking man. you are homo sapiens sapiens, thinking thinking man (and woman).what the anthropologists who named the human race had in mind originally i can't speculate. but to me, it means that you, the crown jewel of all creation, able to peer into the depths of the universe that birthed you and fathom its origins, are capable of thought. and not just thought, but thought about thought.you can be thinking one moment, aw man, that ******* just cut me off - i hate him! and the next second you can think, well, that's silly - he's probably just late for work, and proceed to chuckle about the incident and continue along your merry way.what you did there was a skill unique to humans called metacognition, or thinking about thinking. in addition to your ability to have thoughts about thoughts, it's also your general ability to redirect thought independently of circumstance.if in delicate moments you've ever chosen to focus on baseball scores or george clooney instead of the task at hand, congratulations - you have performed metacognition.ladies and gentlemen - this is kind of a big deal.one could say that strengthening your metacognition muscle is the essence of all eastern spiritual practice. to be the calm in the storm, to transmute hate into love, to choose the best action instead of reacting to circumstance unconsciously - these are all metacognitive skills and the goal of meditative practice.as an added bonus, metacognitive skills may also be the foundation of lifelong success, as elaborated in this brilliant article by jonah lehrer in this week's new yorker. young children who are able to suppress their urges for immediate gratification by redirecting their attention end up being much more successful as adults.5) practice gratitude.if you're reading this now, chances are you have a roof over your head, clean clothes on your body, and a decent internet connection - i.e., a lot to be grateful for.so appreciate everything that you may have taken for granted - friends, family, food, shelter, health, fuzzy slippers. gratitude is its own reward - the more you practice it, the better you'll feel. make it a practice every morning to set aside a few minutes to jot down five things you're grateful for. after just a week, you'll be surprised by the list and learn a lot about what really matters to you.so if you're running around developing yourself while doing things you enjoy, making people feel great around you while keeping yourself in good stead over the long term, and controlling your thoughts so they create your happiness and success while being grateful about it all, you're not just being spiritual - you're winning at life. and you don't need any trappings for that - just you will do.......dr. alex benzerauthor, tao of dating for women, tao of dating for menposted: may 28, 2009 05:12 pm
794,so, i am currently over 37 weeks pregnant.    dh and i had talked and decided months ago that a vasectomy was probably our best option since we are not planning to have any more children.    the problem is, that is as far as it went so far, talk lol.    we have discussed it several times since then and i even suggested he do it soon b/c i know it isn't an immediate solution.     i read on one of the forums here that it can take up to a year for vasectomy to take full effect (and don't even make me think about the lady that told me her neighbor's dh had one, and she got pg, then she had a tubal and got pg again!!    i nkow that is very rare but omg, the thought terrifies me! lol)    from what i understand is you have to keep going back to the urologist with a    sample so they can check if there are any sperm left and it is not considered safe until the sample is cleared.    i told dh that and he didn't seem to have any problem with it and was still on board.    even agreed it should be done soon (this was months ago) since i obviously can't get pg while pg and for the weeks after the birth when we have to abstain.    well...??    the baby is due any day now and still no appointment, and he has not brought up the subject again.    i don't want to push him to do something he really doesn't want to do, so i am not going to badger him on the issue, he obviously has some hesitation or it would be done.    but i need some form of birth control soon.    i had to get off the pill b/c i was getting migraines all the time and was lethargic, moody, and hated the fact that weight would not come off no matter what i did.    i am thinking of getting an iud.    the copper one though b/c as i stated i do not do well with hormones.    anyone have experiences, good or bad, to share about this form of bc?just wanted to ask anyone's experiences with any of these methods: vasectomy, copper iud or tubal.    i am scared of the tubal b/c of pain, scarring, other possible complications, hormones going out-of-whack, and i've read that it can also cause weight gain.    any help, advice, or personal experiences would help, thanks!
795,hi everyone. i am new to this forum and i was wondering if anyone can help me with a problem i have been having for the past two and a half years. i am 22 yrs old and i have persistent bacterial vaginosis, with other things such as yeast infections and urinary tract infections from time to time. lately, new symptoms are emerging that causes pain around the anus. i wonder if the infection has spread.doctors treated me with antibiotics, metrodidazole, diflucan, and hemroidal cream during the past. my uti and yeast infection symptoms went away but the bacterial vaginosis persisted. i experience pain around the vulva every time i take a stride and sex can be painful.this all started when i was treated for my asthma with steroids such as prednisone, and lots of antibiotics.    i am also on a daily steroid-based inhaler.    i wonder if the medications had messed up my body somehow, and if i had lost the good bacteria to fight off the antigens in my vagina. and if it is, is it reversible?i see the doctor at least once every two months because the symptoms always come back. i am clean, and i've tried everything i can think of from wearing cotton underwear and loose clothing everyday to eating yogurt daily. if anyone has any other suggestions, can you please let me know or refer me to someone who can help? i would really appreciate it. thank you =)this discussion is related topersistent bacterial vaginosis.
796,hi ladies.    i just found out that another friend of mine is pregnant.    she and her hubby had the mentality of if it happens, it happens....and bam, 2nd month, she's pregnant!    i want to be happy for them, but i'm also jealous.if you're like me, i tend to have bad days and good days regarding infertility.    i am depressed on my bad days and have hope on my good days.i am reading a book called hannah's hope.    this book has helped soooo much in answering the continuous question to why me? and dealing with people's insensitive comments.    if you haven't read it, i strongly suggest getting it....it is really great.i just needed to vent...thanks for reading!
797,ds will be 2 in november and dh and i are kind of worried. i read a few different things on the web that sayby 18-20 months he should have around 20-30 words in his vocabulary and should be putting two words together (daddy big, baby crying..etc). he doesnt have nearly that many words. he says dada, mama, hi, more, that...and pretty much thats it. he usually points to what he wants or will pull our hands to show us what he wants instead of trying to say it.i was wondering if anyone else has had an experience with their child like this and do you guys think we should go get his hearing and everything tested? it worries us especially since a little over a month of when he turns two, we will have the new baby and it will be much harder to take as much time to get him to communicate to me what he wants rather then just saying it.any and all advice would be greatly appreciated thanks!! =]
798,i'm not sure if i'm having implantation cramps or not. my period was supposed to be here on the 9th....it is mia. it's not so much cramping as it feels like pressure, not so much gas. like something is pressing down on my lower abdomen, as if i'm wearing low cut tight pants. does this sound like it could be it? i've had this feeling ever since last week, on and off... sometimes more intense than others, and i also feel like i have light cramping feeling...kind of like when i am about to get my period, but much lighter.......i took a hpt last week, but it came up negative.... i'm wondering now if i tested too early. anyone know if this can be it??
799,my ex has told me i am fat so i didnt eat for two weeks. i then split up with him but every time i eat i feel fat and ugly and its the same when i look in the mirror thats what i see a fat and ugly person and i just start crying. i really do not know what to do its making me cut my arms and iam only 17. please help me.
800,having hsg next week. i was wondering if it would be okay to take some xanax or percocet before the procedure. the doc said to take 3 advil but i'm very nervous and scared, would it be alright?if so, which one would be better?thanks
801,my 5 month old is getting a tooth.    for the last 3 days, anything he eats (stage 1 veggie at lunch and dinner) or drinks (4 bottles per day) goes right through him and causes watery diarrhea within 5-20 minutes.    he is happy and playing and does not cry or draw his legs up with the stomach episodes.    i don't think the tooth could be causing this much diarrhea, though.    he is not running a fever. he ran a little one on friday evening but nothing since then.    is this the flu or results of teething??    we haven't changed his food or formula at all. he doesn't seem dehydrated as he is still peeing and his soft spot is not depressed.help!    thanks in advance.

807,i have gotten to the point where i just want to leave him.. we've known each other for about 7 yrs but we got together last year... i knew he would occasionally watch porn, i would watch it with him.. we moved in together about 8 mnths ago, and thats wen i started noticing, it was not occasional.. he has a favorite website that is free, and visits it about 8xs a day..    i confronted him about it how it makes me feel like im not good enough and i dont like it.. he says well thats to bad cuz all men do it i do understand that, but hes not single he has me if hes in the mood.. he doesnt need his hand and other women to look at...    i eventually got over it until one night... my daughter was asleep n i was lying next to her, he was laying on the couch about 5 ft away from the bed... i saw his legs moving quite alot, so i kinda snuck around the couch to see porn on the laptop with him under the sheets playing with himself... i was like are you kidding me!? first my daughter is right in the room, second i am    also in the room if he was so in the mood, why would he choose the porn over an actual vagina? i started crying so i went outside... he didnt come out to talk to me till he was done -_-    he told me he has a problem for me to block porn sites on the laptop... so i did.. ever since i did, he pretty much begs me to give him the password everyday... at least 3xs a day...    its been blocked for 3 mnths, found out he has some videos saved on his usb, so i deleted everything... today i was on frost wire n saw at least 50 videos that he downloaded within a 3 day span... and saved them on his portable hard drive... he saw me with the hard drive and literaly ran to me and was trying to wrestle it out of my hands... its like he cares    more about watching porn, than my own feelings... porn is number one to him.. he will argue n fight to keep at it... i threatend to leave and he says ok just turn off all the lights when yur done.. what should i do?!

810,sooooo! i have been having the perfect textbook discharge for ovulation....but my opk is negative!!!! we had sex last night just in case but i'm so confused. i just came off the pill, but i never had this type of discharge on the pill. its the clear sticky stringy kind and sometimes comes out in clumps. i get the egg white stuff too. my husband is deploying soon and we don't have forever!!! i'm around day 19 but i don't know!!! i'm so worried i missed it or it's not coming! please help!
811,ok this sounds really stupid but i'm just curious coz i've read some stuff on google.. can your partner experience pregnancy symptoms instead of the female? i just had a weird period and i've been feeling nauseous and smelling weird things but my boyfriend had been getting headaches, feeling nauseous and the yesterday he wouldn't eat a double cheeseburger from maccas because the smell made him almost throw up.. he's also really tired while i'm not sleeping at all..i might be looking into it too much but i'd rather ask people then just think about it.. could i be pregnant?
812,had annoying pain in lower right area.    i do have history of pain due to scar tissue from having large babies.    went to gyno and he did vaginal ultrasound and urine sample.    told me it appeared i had a cyst rupture, some fluid on pelvis.    he called 3 days later and said urine was negative of anything, ultrasound did not show anymore cysts, tumors or oversized organs.    i was still having some pain and he said to see regular dr.    seen her and she felt around, found i flinched when pressing on hips and said i have strain on my muscle behind my hip.    later that evening had pain in lower back and burning sensation in right side groin area.    went back the next week.    she wants me to have phys. therapy for hip.    i am concerned that this seems to be too big a coincidence.    she also mentioned my pants were too tight (thanks!) and that will also cause pain i am experiencing.    also said i am extremely anxious and all muscles (back, neck, etc) seemed tensed up (i do have a history of anxiety).    she said to give it a week and if it will give me comfort she will order an abdominal ct.    the pain has lessened, but i am still worried.    do i just give it some time or should i have the ct?    what all do these ultrasounds show?    thanks for your help!
813,so i'm 17 years old and my boyfriend says he 's going to ask me to marry him in a year when i get out of high school. it's hard to describe how much we love each other. we've been going out for a year and we're now just starting to have sex. i've been on birth control the entire time and we've been using condoms. we've had sex about 30 times in the past 4 months and i haven't gotten pregnant. does that mean we're just really lucky or does this mean that might not be capable of getting pregnant naturally in the future? kinda a stupid question huh?
814,i got tested but they said i was ok. a month later, my left side of my vagina has been very sore. it looks like i have tear inside my vagina on that side. i have had watery white colored discharge. my clitorus and labia are red and painful. sometimes my anus hurts too. i tried yeast infection treatments with no relief. this has been going on for months. any suggestions...
815,i have posted here before but i am still dealing with this issue:i moved down to florida from nj for grad school to get my masters in occupational therapy, 6 months later i met my current boyfriend who i have been with 1 year and a half. when i first started dating him i knew he went to college but did not finish, which i was hesitant to at first but he had a good job as a general manager at a store making decent money. 4 months later the store closed and he was out of a job for 5 months which i understood because of the economy. he held that job for 5 months then they let him go the end of march because they could not afford to pay him anymore. since then he has not had a job, he says hes looking but hes picky because he wants a job that is in his preferred salary range. i think he is currently collecting unemployment, i say i think because when i ask him he does not like to talk about it because hes embarrassed.    he does side work once in a while for a friend for his company and said they are looking to hire so he sent them his resume but he keeps saying that since april.i just graduated this weekend and have 3 months of fieldwork left. i go to fieldwork everyday and hes at home watching tv or on some days he will grill and drink with the guys. we dont go on many dates because i cant afford to pay for him. even though i dont have alot of money i will get him little surprises here and there. he will cook dinner for and do laundry but i do that too. for my birthday he got me very nice gifts and put alot of thought but didnt get me anything for my graduation (im not sure if i should of expected anything?).    i love him and his family but he is not financially responsible. at the end of november i have to decide to stay in this relationship or not. i want to move closer to nj where my family is also.i just dont know if i am over thinking this situation? what do you think?
816,i had unprocted sex on feb 26/27, we used a condom but half the time we also didn't use one. i kno pre-*** can make a pregnancy occur but i think the chances are slim. i was supposed to get my period on march 13th, but i still didn't get it up to day. it's 9 days late and counting. i am experiencing terrible back pain, my breasts are so sore they hurt every time i roll over in bed. i didn't gain weight, a lil bit of nauseau but no vomitting. no weird food cravings, and now i'm getting a white creamy discharge, just a very little. my period never been this late before, i'm planning on taking a pregnancy test by next week tuesday and a blood test later that week. may my body just be fooling me that im pregnant? it sometimes feels like it's all in my head yet these symptoms r really happening.
817,it seems that my lasik in 1999 resulted in binocular diplopia. i started fairly nearsighted both eyes    (-7) with strabismus of the left eye (outward).    (eye muscle surgery at 9 only for cosmetic purposes; never wore prisms).    initially went farsighted after lasik to approx. +2 and started to see 2 after 6 weeks.    after about 2 years and working with my new eye surgeon we finally realized that the position of my eyes changed and my strabismus eye was now going cross-eyed, thus the seeing 2.    a total of 7 surgeries later between the 2 eyes with the most recent 6 weeks ago, my problem has signficantly improved.    again, the better my good eye sees, the less i see 2.    my strabismus eye had been corrected back to -1 a few years ago and this off balance with my good eye seemed to be the final step in fixing my problem.    (to add to the problem, i was now at reading glasses stage and i essentially ended up with monovision.    and monovision does not work when you have strabismus so that caused yet another problem)    that is, my surgeon performed lasik on the eye to correct the -1 and my off balance feeling is gone and my eyes seem to be back to their old (albeit 8 years ago) position.    so essentially, my initial lasik resulted in a change in eye position and the battle of the eye muscles.is this something that has become an issue with lasik (apparently at that time no dr. had heard of this and i saw many dr's!).
818,just a few questions about baby showers...how far along where you when you had your baby shower?is it uncommon to have baby showers if it's your third?i had a baby shower for my ds and my dd.    this one is another dd, but she'll be due in the summer.. my other two were both due in the fall.    i would like to have another baby shower for this one, 1) because she is due in the summer 2) because it will be 5 years since my last one and all the stuff i have it outdated 3) because i have new friends i would like to have attend.    so, how common is it?    i don't want people to think it's weird to have a 3rd shower.also, how far along where you when you started buying stuff for your baby?thanks.

820,hi um.. im 16 and me and my boyfriend had sex for almost everyday for the past week and a half, unprotected. i was suppose to start my period the 2nd week of the month and got early cramps, after the 14th of the month i still hadn't strted but continued to get cramps. its the 19th and my period is later after the 21st. i'm still experiencing cramps here and there but no blood, am i pregnant?
821,heyi really need advice on this please. i have been with my fiance for nearly 2 yrs now and there is a major problem which is really getting me down. her sex drive is very low and mine would be quite high. i suppose it has been like this since near enough the start but i thought that it might have been the initial stages of a relationship. but i was wrong, and now i am in too deep to do anything about it, i have tried talking about it with her but have had no joy. i am not the type of guy that would go off with someone else since im not getting it at home but it is really getting me down. if i have tried to initiate it 10 times i would get turned down 9 and that is not the nicest feeling in the world regardless when she says its nothing to do with me. i would say we make love once a week but nearly always stretches to once a fortnight and i initiate it every time. i will stress that it is not that i want to just simply get it...i really think that it is the connection thats made...corny i know but i think its true.i really am at my wits end and dunno what to dothanks

832,hi my son is 3 years old and has been toilet trained in the way of urinating on the toilet for at leaat 10 months, however no matter what i try he will not poo in the toilet or potty, he seems afraid of this, one time he did go on the toilet and we made a big fuss over it, only for him to revert to pooing his pants, he appears to know that it is wrong to do this as he always goes away and hides when he is doing a poo, he also does not seem to mind if he has poo in his pants and will not come and say that he has done poo in his pants, and he sometimes dneies having pooed his pants when you ask him if he has or not, i am unsure of what to do or try next, he does have other behavioral issues and i am not sure if these are linked in any way or not.

841,my son and i recently took an afternoon to spend together alone.    after weeks of wanting to go bowling i took him last saturday.    he is very competitive and started getting frustrated when i had more points than him.    when his turn was over he started getting very angry.    i sat down next to him to explain that he gets to bowl twice, and then i get to bowl twice.    while trying to explain this to him, he slapped me across the face!    i was devastated and shocked.    i said get your shoes on, we are leaving.    i paid for the unfinished game and turned in our shoes.    we went to the car and i started crying.    this only seemed to make him more upset.    i told him we do not hit.    this is something he knows.    he has been told this repeatedly, as he occasionally will hit his younger brother (20months).when he was two he had a really hard time with hitting.    we worked on this behavior and i thought we had gotten over the worst of it.    he no longer and hasn't for a long time, hits other kids for toys, etc....    he is very competitive and particular about the way things are done.    but clearly, hitting mom is way out of line.    what do i do?    i don't think this is normal behavior for a four year old.....

843,i had two kids in the span of 18 months and i noticed that my afs are getting more and more painful with each time.    i had ds 7 months ago and had 3 afs already and man is it painful!    i don't recall having such terrible cramps/bloating/cravings and the whole nine yards before having my kids.    all i'd get is some bloating and that was it.    what the heck happened?    why am i in so much pain now??    anyone else going through this?
844,my husband and i have been trying to conceive since december with no luck.    my last period was april 30 and my cycles were about 27 days.    i haven't had a period since april but 4 negative pregnancy tests.    the doctors told me years ago that i had pcos so they put me on metformin to help me get pregnant with my daughter.    i went to a specialist who told me that i don't have pcos because i didn't have many of the symptoms that people have with pcos.    i'm wondering since i haven't gotten pregnant yet and i'm on day 40 of my cycle right now would it be possible that i have pcos again or that i've had it all along and the doctor was wrong when he told me i didn't have it?
845,im 26 years old i had an abortion a year and 2 months ago ive been trying to get pregnant for the past six months but i havent been able to my last period was on the 15th of may lasted for the normal 6 to 7 days my cycle is like 31 to 32 days so i had sex before and on my ovulation day then i started to bleed two weeks before my period was due so i thought it was implantation so i took a pregnancy test it was negative so when it was time for me to come on it didn't so i took another one it was still negative so on the 8th day after i would normally go off i start to bleed is this my period
846,ok so here is the problemim 22yrs old i have never had any problems with periods till i was 19, no cramps, no bloating, no nothing. the first sympton was constipation. i was given fiber, laxitives, pills, i was told i ate too much spicy foods, i was told it was irritable bowl syndrome, i went to the doctor several times only to come out with different answers, different medicine and no cure. secondly, i started to feel some discomfort in my periods. one period i thought i was dying and almost went to the hospital. my aunt came over and told me it was probably just a bad cramp and so i waited it out and sure enough my period came shortly after and the mysterious pain stoped. so i was good for a few more months no pain or anything. then my side started hurting. i shruged it off at first but after a couple of days it gots worse and night i just couldnt sleep. i went to the hospital and they said i had an ovarian cyst, that luckly exploded when i got there so no surgery was needed. they gave no explination as to why i had one and sent me on my way.third, a couple months later i started getting insane pain during my periods and was still constipated with mucus. the pain got so bad i started throwing up and midol nor pamprin would work only ibuprofen. meanwhile i got a colonospy done and found nothing. i got an edocospy done and they said i had acid reflux which is obvious bcus if the food cant go down it will come back up. i also got a ultrasound and they said things were ok. fourthly, at first i thought it was just my imagination but then i realised it was real, the blood during my period was coming out my rectal area. so now during my periods, they were heavy, they hurt so bad i threw up, and they gave me diahrea with bloody stool. i went to the doctor saying i was throwing up, my stomach hurt, i had diahrea and i was on my period. he gave me a shot in the but and said i had food poisoning. eventualy i got perscribed ibuprofen 400mg then 600mg for the pain. later i went back to the doctor had another ultrasound, they said i had fluid in my ovaries which they thought mite be period blood and so i was referred to a gyno. the gyno said i had endometriosis. she gave me birth control for it and moved up my ibuprofen perscription to 800mg. a year later still having the same horrible periods, birth control is doing anything. the pain killers help but when i dont take them i still have hurtful periods. im tired of going back and forth to the doctor and nothing is working.

872,'don't touch my junk,' is taking on new meaning.truck nuts, fake bull testicles made of plastic or metal that drivers hang on the back of their pickups to make a truck look more manly, have been around for years. some find them funny, while others find them offensive, prompting at least three states to try to ban them -- unsuccessfully.but a recent case in south carolina is fueling debate over whether these ornaments violate a state's indecency laws and if attempting to regulate them infringes on freedom of speech.on july 5, virginia tice, 65, from bonneau, s.c. pulled her pickup truck into a local gas station with red, fake testicles dangling from the trailer hitch. the town's police chief, franco fuda, pulled up and asked her to remove the plastic testicles.when she refused, he wrote her a $445 ticket saying that she violated south carolina  s obscene bumper sticker law.the south carolina code of laws reads,   a sticker, decal, emblem, or device is indecent    in a patently offensive way, as determined by contemporary community standards, sexual acts, excretory functions, or parts of the human body.  tice lawyered up and said that she was preparing to challenge fuda in court. but before she could ask for a jury trial, fuda, in a rare move, beat her to it.fuda says he is pushing for a jury trial and hopes the outcome will clarify the state  s obscenity laws, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  the law is very clear, and i am prepared to take it all the way,   fuda told foxnews.com.scott bischoff, tice  s lawyer, says his client is not bowing down because   this whole thing was caused by the arresting officer, who is arbitrarily interpreting a statute incorrectly.  bischoff will argue whether these large, red, plastic testicles are   really an accurate depiction of a human body part.    he is nuts,   says jay bender, a lawyer and professor at the university of south carolina, referring to fuda and his interpretation of the law. bender says although tasteless and stupid, they are not illegal, and adds,   chief fuda is abusing his arrest powers.   he says the statute is very clear about what material is obscene and   it doesn  t have anything to do with artificial bull testicles.  david hudson, a first amendment attorney and scholar, says laws banning these types of decals, emblems or bumper stickers are problematic, but often someone just hasn  t challenged them.hudson believes tice and her lawyer can make a good case the south carolina law is   unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally board, and it violates the first amendment.  in the past, lawmakers in tennessee, virginia, maryland and florida have proposed legislation to ban these types of decals and other explicit bumper stickers.hudson detailed many cases where law enforcement officials cited individuals for the content of their bumper stickers, and in the majority of those cases, a judge tossed them out because   the first amendment protects a great deal of offensive expression.  hudson also cites the supreme court  s opinion that   the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.  even though the attempts to ban truck nuts have been unsuccessful, customers are still leery about their legality.trick trucks, a truck accessory chain, has been selling them for years and has had customers question whether they are illegal. keith dillard says sales at his lanham, md., store are hit and miss, but   when people talk about outlawing or banning them, they come in to buy them up.    i can  t see a piece of plastic being offensive, it  s not like you can  t see that along the road, there are farms all over,   says ron pelletier, assistant manager of the trick trucks in waldof, md. both say most people buy them as gag gifts.neither side in bonneau, s.c., is laughing over this legal mess, but they do agree the public interest in the case is shocking. fuda said that he  s been getting a lot of feedback from people, including one florida woman who stopped by the police station to say she was glad he wrote the ticket, while another man called to ask,   if we didn  t have anything better to do?    we concur with the sentiments of people in our community and across the nation that this whole thing is a big waste of time, but it was all started by chief fuda,   says bischoff.the case goes to trial next month.read more: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/08/02/hanging-truck-nuts-grows-into-free-speech-debate/#ixzz1tt7nudnu

874,today i went in for my u/s and i am kind of concern because it looks like i'm going to have two large follices and two very small ones. the two large ones are exactly the same size which is 18.3.    i'm doing icsi, but i'm worried that i'm going to go through retrieval and find out the next day that none of them made it because they are probably going to only be able to retrive two.    my question is has anyone gone through retrieval with a small amount of follicles and have them all fertilize? this is so hard.

880,did you know that every minute you walk can extend your life by 1.5 to 2 minutes? in addition, many studies show that people who walk regularly live longer, weigh less, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall health than non-walkers.ready to lace on your shoes? if you want to add to the amount of walking you do, just clip on a pedometer. that simple action actually increases your physical activity by over 2100 steps per day, a review that pooled data from 26 studies found.here  s a look at ten benefits of walking.walking increases your lifespanwalking more than an hour a day improves life expectancy significantly, a 2011 study showed. the researchers looked at 27,738 participants between the ages of 40 and 79 over a 13-year period. surprisingly, their lifetime medical costs did not increase  even though they lived longer.  an increase in walking time at the population level would bring about a tremendous change in people  s health and medical cost,   the study authors wrote.walking wards off diabetesjust thirty minutes of walking a day can prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes, a 2002 study looking at both overweight and average weight men and women in a population at high risk for the disease showed.if you already have diabetes, walking is helpful for you, too. a mile or more daily cuts your risk of death from all causes in half, according to a 2007 study.walking keeps your mind sharpwalking 72 blocks a week (around six to nine miles) helps increase grey matter, which in turn lowers the risk of suffering from cognitive impairment  or trouble with concentration, memory and thought, according to a study which looked at 299 seniors over a nine-year period.furthermore, walking five miles per week can provide some protection to the memory and learning areas of the brains of those already suffering from alzheimer  s disease or mild cognitive impairment, and lead to a slower decline in memory loss.walking helps lower blood pressurewalking just 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week  even when the 30 minutes are broken into three ten-minute increments  has been found to significantly lower blood pressure.walking is great for bone healthputting one foot in front of the other for about a mile a day led to improved bone density in post-menopausal women, and slowed the rate of bone loss from the legs, according to a 1994 study.   it takes walkers four to seven years longer to reach the point of very low bone density, study leader dr. krall told the new york times.walking cuts the risk of strokewalking about 12.5 miles a week or more cut the risk of stroke in half, according to a study looking at over 11,000 harvard university alumni with an average age of 58.walking improves your moodif you  re feeling down in the dumps, walking is a quick and easy solution. just thirty minutes on a treadmill reduces feelings of tension and depression, according to research published in the british journal of sports medicine. in fact, the study found that walking lifted moods more quickly than anti-depressants did (and with fewer side effects).and the more people walk, the better their mood and energy, says california state university long beach professor robert thayer, based on a study looking at 37 study participants over a 20-day period.walking torches caloriesjust 20 minutes of walking a day will burn 7 pounds a year. the effects are even more dramatic when you add in some dietary changes as well.walking improves insomniahaving trouble sleeping at night? try taking a brisk 45-minute walk in the morning five days a week, and your sleep may improve significantly, according to research from the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle, which looked at women from the age of 50-74. (walking in the evening, however, sometimes has the opposite effect  so keep an eye on when you  re exercising and what your sleep patterns are.)walking is good for the heartwomen who took brisk walks for three or more hours per week reduced their risk of heart disease by 30-40 percent, according to an analysis of over 72,000 women aged 40-65, who were enrolled in the prospective nurses   health study. as i reported recently, heart attacks kill more us women than men annually. however, the benefits of walking aren  t limited to one gender. a different study showed that walking can cut the risk of coronary heart disease in half for men between the ages of 71 and 93.http://health.yahoo.net/experts/dayinhealth/easiest-way-live-longer

885,i have had two instances, one about 8 months ago and one yesterday where out of nowhere i will start seeing bright light, like you would see from a sparkler flowing down really brightly.    i am a person who suffers from the occassional migraine.    i did not have any kind of headache at either time.    the first time this occurred was right after i had a chest x-ray and walked back to the room.    it happened for approximately 1 minute and i felt a little disoriented.    the same with the one yesterday.    i have searched on the internet and can not find anything that sounds like what i experienced.    the weird thing is my mother called me yesterday, about two hours after it happened to me and said she was in the bath tub and the same thing happened to her.    my mother suffers from ms.    i had an mri done approximately 10 years ago because of the migraines and they didn't see any signs of ms.    do you think this is something i should have checked out again?    my mother is waiting on her neurologist to get back to her and she is going to mention my problem.    any advice would help.
886,hi all, i am new to this community so let me introduce myself. i am 27, dh is 27, we are unable to conceive naturally after 3 years of trying (hubby doesn't produce germ cells) we decided to go with a donor. i have had 3 mc before dh and my hsg revealed a blocked fallopian tube (right). currently using the clearblue easy fertility monitor. i had my first iui on my second cycle of clomid 50mg on the 19th and am currently 4dpiui. the first cycle did not give me an egg symbol. my cycle averages between 32-34 days and i o really late (day20).the weird thing is two days after i felt a pulling/sticking sensation in my lower abd as if someone was sticking me with a needle. it was very uncomfortable, and stopped on yesterday. i have never had that feeling before...ever now i am cramping slightly, frequent urination, some light-headed feeling and bloated. i am wondering if this will give me my bfp. what do ya'll think? i can test on the 1st since af is due on the 30th. has anyone ever experienced this? don't wanna get my hopes up but this is weird and i need answers.
887,i'm wondering if my 4 1/2 year old daughter might be adhd or just defiant to her parents. she can go to other people;s houses and play and listen but when she is home she is a totally different child. she doesn't listen to simple tasks like picking up toys or sit down at the table, everytime we are on the phone she screams, somebody comes to the door she goes running to it, she can't sit and watch a half hour tv show. when we take her out she has a fit out in public and starts screaming. she makes a scene everytime we go out. i don't know what to do. we have a 9 month old son as well and i was thinking some of the problem was a new person in the house but her behavior doesn't improve. does this sound like it could be adhd or just an overly hyperactive child. she is going to be starting school this year and i'm concerned about how she is going to act...any suggestions..it's gotten to where we miss out on doing alot of things because she refuses to listen and has a tantrum when we go out.
888,hi i'm concerned about my left eye i been noticed for several months now on a black spot in my vision i read the other posts to see if anything was mentioned about it but i mean its like u said floaters but here is the trick it doesn't float around its in one spot all the time unless i move my eye ball to the side but it moves with the eye if i look left its not that noticable but i look right its noticable and same when i look straight. i also at times get these ash lookin (is the best way to describe it) spots but it also flickers and seems like ash is really falling in front of me, what i mean by flicker not like a light switch but like a light bulbs electric wire that makes light bright then fades on occasions and that only my left eye my right i have a twitch that i can't say how offten or if there is a pattern because it occures off and on. for example it will twitch one day out of the blue the twitching lasts for about a minute then stops and it happens again and lasts a lil over a minute then stops i tryed to just rub it away maybe its my nerves tightning up but when an eposode happens it tends to drag out for an hour off and on like i said. but that's not my main concern, i'm more worried about my left eye. but would like some advise on whats going on with both of them. i been to eye doctors as a child nothing was detected but i was told to wear glasses when i didn't even need them. i have twenty/ twenty vision so i know what ever is wrong has not affected my vision but i was at age 19 told to were glasses again due to my studies that required being in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day if not more. and i'm talkin without no breaks. my vision ended up in both eyes becoming blurry like water in my eyes but i had no tears nor water in my eyes they were normal. i also have these bad headaches that are i would have to say by my eyes. i discribed the feeling and where it was coming from to family and a family doctor they said it's a migraine. yet i didn't have sensitivity to light nor noise. just the pain that was coming from the back of my eyes to the front and even the sides like if it could just be a tension headache. i tried over the counter migrain medicine, advil, ibrophin, tylonal, asprin, alieve, a frozen eye mask even nothin seems to work for the pain so i just deal with it. i have never been given an mri on my brain but been told to get one done but i don't know if that would even help either or am i wrong. i have had my head banged up on pavment, concrete, large objects, such as hard cover thick thick books, bats, basically hard objects to the head as i was young and sometimes i get pushed hard where i hit my head on a cabinate door and i have blacked out a couple of times when hit or hit my head i have never been taken to the hospital though to get checked due to me being affraid of doctors and also that trust that i don't have with them. i honestly don't see a doctor unless i have to for a female the yearly check up and to get antibiotics if i have an infection but so you are aware my last visit everything is normal blood and urine came out fine no diabetes, no high cholesterol, nothing not even high blood pressure. the only thing wrong with me is my weight but my health is as if an active healthy weight person if not better just a weight issue. so i am confussed i mean in my family eye problems are a thing but like i said all the eye doctors i have seen said i have perfect vision and there is no need for glasses nor do i have anything wrong with my eyes. i have had a wire hanger jammed into my right eye and that's when i started the twitchin in that eye so i can see that as a reason why my eye twitches. and no i didn't seek medical attention when i got help to remove the hanger and that happened oh i would have to say when i was about 10 1/2 11 years old i am currently 23 years old by the way. back to the headaches i know it has to deal with my eyes since the pain is only coming from my eyes and no where else at times my eye sockets hurt so much that it even hurts to blink my eyes get blood shocked and when they are really bad i end up with nose bleeds. or even wake up with my pillow covered in blood i'm totally concerned and i don't know what to do first when i mention my headaches to my primary physician i get a feeling as if he's not listining so i just gave up and like i said i been dealing with the pain. also the aggitation of the black spot and ash at times in the left eye and twitching in the right. but like the twitchin has been like that for18 or 18 1/2 years so i'm kind of used to it by now. it's just the ash thing and blsck spot but i would like to get you opinion and maybe some advise on what i should do first. headaches are an everyday thing just other days are worse then others i can't tollerate it any more i don't want to have to go my whole life with headaches and wierd eye things going on. so i come to you for your professional oppinion and well some guidance on what i need to do and if its something major or just something mild and can be taken cared of. please help!!!!! i don't know what else to do. and i feel as if i'm not taking the right way about all of this so i would like your help if you can please even if you have no clue on whats wrong at least point me in the right direction as of what i need to do and get done first. thank you for your time. a concerned indevidual
889,i have been running for about 6 months now, i started off slow and only covered about 1km or so and now i'm doing up to 4km. i am tall so a faster pace is always easier for me and i sometimes throw one or two sprints in the distance.what i have noticed recently though is that my calves are looking pretty bulky!! it is annoying me because i am a teenage girl and bulky limbs don't look too good.i have been running quite regularly recently since getting an exercise buddy and i usually cover 3-4km run with two sprints in it and a 5-10minute brisk hill walk and then a ten minute slow walk to cool down.if this is how i exercise 3-5times a week, what can i do to avoid getting very bulky calves and adding to my built look and also any tips for quickly cutting down inner thigh fat?thanks so, so much! xx
890,i have a soon to be 3 yr old.    the last couple of days, she has been very fresh, talking back, keeps saying that she doesn't want to go anywhere or with anyone.    she has been acting fresh with her grandparents.    i have been wondering if it is due to my 17yr old that moved back in with us in sept 22, 2007.    my 17 yr old is also uncontrollable and most of the time she's saying and doing things infront of the little one.    i'm also having stress with a custody case for my 17 yr old and my ex husband is not being easy.    i am at my last nerve.    i don't know what to do.    i'm wondering if also my age 43 has something to do with it.    i just don't want to have a disrespecting kid like my 17 yr old.    when i brought up my other 2 children till they were 10 & 11, they were not disrespecting to me.    i only happened when after i left their father.    my 17 yr old came to me with all the problems from 10 yrs old till 17.    so my stress level as you can see is at a very high level and it's going to make me live shorter than normal.    i need help!!! i hope you can help me.

894,hi,me and my partner had unprotected sex 16 days ago (sept 14), but he pulled out before orgasm and we didn't think much of it. 12 days ago the condom broke so we got the morning after pill. i was originally planning on starting birth control on my next period, and the pharmacist said that i could start and the morning after pill wouldn't make a difference. so when my next period started (or what i thought was my period), 7 days ago, i took the first dose of birth control pills. and the instructions say that if you take it on the first day of your period then you're apparently protected from there on. so we had unprotected sex again, but then there was no bleeding the next day. so i got worried that it was just discharge (my last period was on september 1st, so the dates seem to be fine, but i'm not sure now since there was no bleeding afterwards) i took a home pregnancy test today and it came out negative, but i'm still worried. is there still a chance i could be pregnant?thanks

898,hi alllet me give you a brief background. my baby would not sleep the first 3 weeks of her life. thankfully my mother figured out that she had gas. so we fixed that problem by me not drinking any milk and releiving the gas. ok at the same time my mom took nighttime duty for 3 nights to give me a break (aaaahhh) well mom had the baby sleep in her carseat. the baby slept for 6-8 hours and has ever since then.    since then my baby will not sleep in her crib....and honestly i voted for more sleep than to fight with my baby whom i fought with for the first 3 gassy weeks of her life.    i have transitioned her to nap in her crib during the day but her naps (honestly) stink. she is up an hour, down an hour up and hour down an hour. she has always been a bad sleeper.    then at night we do her routine that we have been doing since week 4 (baby is now 11 weeks old). its bath, cd and play, feeding, put her to sleep in the car seat awake and give her the pacifier. she goes to sleep and will wake up 40 mins later crying. we go in after 5 mins to sooth her, then if she crys again we give her 6 mins    then 7 etc. it usually take us about 2 hours to get her down. ok so i was thinking that she is getting big enough to sleep in her crib since she naps in the crib. so tonight we did the routine (bed, cd and play, feeding) and i put her in the crib awake and turned on the peek a boo aquarium thing i got from target. my baby loves this thing. she watch it and drifted off to sleep with no issues. well she woke up 40 mins later (just like she does in the carseat) and so i did the same routine of waiting 5 mins, 6, 7 etc before going in to sooth her. well i got up to waiting 15 mins and the baby is crying nonstop. the only thing that sooths her is if i turn on the aquarium thing but she crys when that is done ( about 12 mins later).    needless to say i asked the hubby to get the carseat out of my car. baby is in the car seat right now sleeping like an angel.    i want to transition her now before i go back to work (on 03/16)ok so here is my questionwhat did other moms do to transition their baby from the carseat to the crib? please dont tell me to elevate the mattress unless that worked for you. my baby naps in her crib with no problem (even if its only an hour nap..she has always been a bad napper) is this just a phase my baby will grow out of and she will let me know when she is ready for her crib? is there a specific technique any of you other moms have done to get her used to her crib? someone said to buy another chaning table and put the baby in that since it kind of cradles them. please give me details too.    when did your baby get out of the carseat? how long did it take (1 week, 1 month, 1 day etc) and most importantly    what did your baby do during this transistion (cranky, cried for 15 mins, or just fine and slept better)i feel like such a crappy mom because i feel like i cant understand my baby. i feel like she hates me because she crys at everything when i try to change her routine up.(stubborn just like daddy :)sorry for the long post. i really want my baby to    sleep well. her crib looks so much more comfortable than the carseat...plus i am worried about a flat head.
899,i always have normal periods. i am so used to my birth control that i always start on or around the time of my spacer pills. this month i started my period at the time of my spacer pills on dec. 9th. it was a normal 6 day/regular flow period for me ending on the 15th. to my surprise i started again on christams eve... dec. 24th. so from the end of one period, to the beginning of another was only 9 days apart. it is currently day 10 of this second period. the first 7 days were just as a normal period... maybe a bit heavier than usual... and these past 3 days have been pure brown discharge only. no blood.what could be causing this? 2 periods in 1 month and plus the brown dishcarge following?
900,how do i know if i am pregnant if i have irregular periods. i have to children already. it has just been awhile. and i hd two miscarriages within the last two years.
901,i also have a 6 year old son jack (and a 6 mnth old lilly).    i have been very sick most of jack's life.    i have a ton of medical problems, pacemakers, ports, pic lines, home health, gastroparesis, kidney cancer, a hernia, feeding tubes.... the list goes on and on.    once i passed the hospital with my son in the car and he said look mom, you live there!    i just wanted to cry.jacks father is not involved, but not by choice.    jack's father was living with me...i got a call from my apartment complex that i had not paid my rent...come to findout he had spent all my money on crystal meth....so... i kicked him out of my house and 4 weeks later found out i was pregnant.    i had no way of contacting him and can't find him.    so i've been    a single parent all this time.    jack is at a age now, just started kindergarden, that he is noticing he doesn't have a dad.    i also just had lilly, his sister, and i think he wonders about that too.    he hasn't asked me about his father, but his teachers say different.    i had a parent teacher meeting and they said he had spoken about his dad a few times, but they know i'm a single parent.    that made me so sad.    i don't know how to talk to him about this...i just had lilly and before now i had never seen any jealousy (sp) toward her, but i think he is starting to show some.    i have to spend a lot of time with her because she is still so little and sometimes he has to wait a little while.jack doesn't listen to me...and this is another problem.    since i have so many medical problems i am disabled and i am sick a lot.    i lost my job and my house when i got sick, so we have had to live at home with my parents.    i love my parents and i am very thankful for them, don't get me wrong...but somethimes its made it harder on me.    my mother calls my son hers.    sometimes i feel like he is more like my brother then my son.    she takes control of everything.    somtimes because she has had too cause i'm so sick, but others just because.    ex.    i told jack no cookies.    10 min later he comes around the courner with cookies saying i got desert, i got desert!!! to my face.    she gave them to him.    i can walk into the room and he stares daggers at me.    i got up this morning...didn't do anything...just got up and went to get a bottle.    my mother was in the kitchen i told her the day before that jack didn't listen to me and that he was being ugly.    i can tell him to do something and i'll have to say mom!! and she tells him to do whatever i just said and he does it.    anyway i was in the kitchen and he comes in you ruined my day yesterday!!    i just looked at him and my mother was like jack, why would you say that?    and lastnight i was to be home alone with the kids and my sister was the last to leave.    when she walked out the door he looked at me with disgust and said great! now i'm stuck with you! and walked off.    she made him say sorry to me, but when i walked out of the kitchen he was in the hall glaring at me.    i lost it and started crying.    my kid hates me.    my mother is now going to put him in counciling, but for the moment we can hardly be in the same room together.    i'm the adult and i'm trying to be one, but this is very difficult.    i'm going though so much physically with my health, mentally, i'm dealing with a 6 mnth old, i'm dealing with court on lilly and her father, i found out i had cancer 4 mnths ago...so much and now this.    ladies i don't know what to do and i desperatly need some help.    he is going to do counciling and i think i need some.    i don't want this to be going on when he is 16.    i want him to be happy and healthy, i want to have a good relationship with my son, but i feel like i'm loosing him.    my mother make it worse when she constantly calls him hers and does everything before i get the chance to try... i'm just at a loss here.
902,to anyone who might have insight,i entered the military a 19, and have served six years in the air national guard, and the past two in the army national guard until present. i will be hitting my 8 years of service this december 2010. i have about accumulated about 3 years of active service for training and various active duty tours. no overseas tours, i volunteered, but never deployed to combat, though i did spent a year in kuwait as an army civilian. i am 26 now, and a e-5/sgt. in the army national guard. full-time, i am civilian service in the army community. my mos is public affairs, and i am attached to an mpad (mobile public affairs detachment) national guard unit. in one capacity or another, in uniform or out, i have served this country since 2003.i remember having pain throughout most of my adult life, and thinking it was normal. i went through bootcamp and ait with it. after the pain escalted during my time in kuwait, i began seeking professional care through my civilian healthcare, and returned to the states after my commitment at the end of the year. i went through about two years of testing and worsing symptoms to include pain and insomnia. it got so bad to the point of depression, problems with work and family, and just be able to fully function. i was finally diagnosed this past september with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. after finding a great dr. and working on a multi-facated treatment plan, i am not cured but functioning better than i have in two years.because my diagnosis is recent, my name has not come up for deployment, and i have been able to muster through drill periods for the last two years, i have not yet disclosed this information to the army national guard. i am concerned that if i do, i will be    discharged and lose my current education benefits. i am also concerned because i have served 8 years of service, and am i not finished. i have a spotless service record, and only one line-of-duty injury that i have been able to recover from for the most part. i want to deploy still, and finish serving my time. i do not know how the army or veterans affairs will treat me because of the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue and serving mostly as a national guard member or army civilian, and not on regluar active duty. at this point, i am taking regular medications and being treated for pain management weekly, still passing pt diagnostics unless i'm am in the middle of a flair-up, and continuing to perform to the best of my abilities. there is no known cause, or cure for this, and only my former lt, who is no longer a guard member, is aware of the condition. i am being treated with several medications that help with pain and insomnia, physical and massage therapy, and doing regular yoga and exercise.though i am doing well now, i do not know how my condition would react should i have to deploy or attend training courses i will coming up for, such as wlc, ect. i had also hoped to apply to a combat camera unit (airborne) with a high deployment tempo, a goal i have now put on hold until i can figure out a game plan.    though i want to deploy, i understand the risk i could put others in if i am not healthy in combat zone.i am not looking for an out from the military, nor am i looking for guidance on how to get the military to give me a disability rating. i'm looking for guidance on how i might be treated when, or if i even should, disclose this information to the military, and hoping to find anyone with experience with this, or a doctor in the military community that might now what would come next. thank you.
903,i saw this on cnn last night and was glad i could find it to post.    it's interesting and makes me really wonder what will happen come nov.    it seems that the majority of americans still hold the republicans and george bush responsible for the current economic situation.    yet at the same time the majority do not approve of the job obama is doing with it.    in my mind this makes the nov. elections interesting...it sure doesn't sound like it's cut and dry to me.    i wonder what will happen.    anyway, here is the article.....81% rate u.s. economy as 'poor' - cnn pollfaith karimi, cnn newsdesk editorseptember 5, 2010: 9:42 am etwashington (cnn) -- a new national poll released sunday indicates that eight in 10 americans say that the economy is in poor shape, and the number that say conditions are very poor is on the upswing after steady declines through the spring.and according to a cnn/opinion research corporation survey, more people blame the republicans over the democrats for the country's economic problems.* 24** 0diggsdigg* email* print* commenteighty-one percent of the public rates the county's economic conditions as poor, with 18% describing the economy as good. forty-four percent of people questioned describe economic conditions as very poor, up seven points from july.the poll indicates that roughly half the country says that conditions have not improved in the past two years. the other half says that the economy has gotten better, but many of them expect things will get worse in the near future.0:00 /37:05'uncertainty' threatens u.s. economyroughly a third of all americans say that the economy has gotten better and will continue to do so, says cnn polling director keating holland. but one in five say that things have gotten better but will take a turn for the worse in the months ahead -- essentially predicting the double-dip that many economists are worried about.so which party gets the blame for the country's current economic problems?according to the survey, more americans hold the republicans responsible than the democrats, with 44% blaming the gop and 35% picking the democrats.and when george w. bush's name is added to the mix, the number who blame the republicans rises to 53%, with just a third saying that barack obama and his party are at fault. that indicates why the democrats are likely to mention bush's name every chance they get between now and election day, holland said.happy labor day, workers!but according to numbers released friday, just four in 10 americans say they approve of the job president barack obama is doing on the economy.the 40% who give obama a thumbs up is a new low for the president on the economy in cnn polling.the cnn/opinon research corp. poll was conducted wednesday and thursday, with 1,024 adult americans questioned by telephone. the survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.-- cnn deputy political director paul steinhauser contributed to this report.    to top of page

906,http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iranian-charged-in-terror-plot/2011/10/11/giqaiayxcl_story.htmlu.s. officials on tuesday said that they had foiled an elaborate terrorist plot backed by factions of the iranian government aimed at assassinating the saudi ambassador to washington.at a news conference, attorney general eric h. holder jr. said two iranians have been charged with conspiracy to murder a foreign official and conspiracy to commit an act of international terrorism, among other charges. one of the suspects, an iranian with u.s. citizenship, was arrested in new york last month; the other, an iranian, remains at large.188commentsweigh incorrections?inshare.gallery  the justice department accused elements of the iranian government of being involved in a plot to assassinate adel a. al-jubeir, saudi arabia  s ambassador to the united states.videotwo people have been charged with conspiracy to kill the saudi ambassador to the u.s. a federal criminal complaint filed in new york says the two conspired to use a weapon of mass destruction and have ties to iran. (oct. 11)more on this storydocument: terror charges against manssor and shakuridocument: justice department press release on the alleged plotread more national security storiesmore headlines from around the worldview all items in this story.  the united states is committed to holding iran accountable for its actions   and would take   further action   against iran later tuesday, holder said.the suspects were identified as manssor arbabsiar, a 56-year-old from texas, and gholam shakuri, an iran-based member of iran  s quds force, an elite division of that country  s revolutionary guard corps responsible for foreign operations.in addition to killing the saudi ambassador, adel al-jubeir, officials said, the plot envisioned later striking other targets. the officials said that the plan to kill the ambassador was directed by tehran, and that arbabsiar has acknowledged that he was recruited and funded by men he understood to be senior officers in the quds force.shortly after the announcement, the iranian government denied the accusations, calling them a new round of   american propaganda,   according to state news agency irna.  the u.s. government and the cia have very good experience in making up film scripts,   ali akbar javanfekr, a spokesman for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad, said in tehran.   it appears that this new scenario is for diverting the u.s. public opinion from internal crises.  officials described the details of the plot as chilling, saying that the conspirators considered blowing up a restaurant frequented by the ambassador.according to a criminal complaint unsealed tuesday, arbabsiar met with a dea informant    who was posing as a representative of a mexican drug cartel    to arrange the killing. at one point, the complaint says, arbabsiar told the informant that he would need four men to carry out the ambassador  s murder and that he would pay $1.5 million for the operation.as a down payment, arbabsiar allegedly later arranged for $100,000 to be wired to an account that was secretly overseen by the fbi.  though it reads like the pages of a hollywood script, the impact would have been very real and many lives would have been lost,   said fbi director robert mueller.a spokesman for the national security council said president obama had been briefed on the case in june.the united states has listed iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. the government in tehran has long denied accusations that it backs terrorism.iran and saudi arabia are bitter political enemies in a long-running middle eastern conflict fueled largely by sectarian rivalries. saudi arabia, a monarchy with a predominantly sunni muslim population, has felt threatened by the shiite leadership of iran ever since the 1979 revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi and replaced him with a theocratic government.jubeir, 49, is one of the best-known saudi figures in the west and among the most powerful foreign policymakers outside the royal family. the son of a saudi diplomat, he speaks fluent german and virtually unaccented american english. a political science and economic graduate from the university of north texas, he also holds a master  s degree in international relations from georgetown university.he first appeared as a spokesman for the saudi government during the 1991 persian gulf war, and quickly became known as a foreign policy adviser to then-crown prince abdullah, with particular influence on policy toward the united states. when it became known that the sept. 11, 2001, al-qaeda attacks were carried out by saudi citizens, jubeir was dispatched to washington to represent the kingdom  s interests before the american public and policymakers. he became ambassador the the united states in early 2007.his extensive contacts within the administration and among lawmakers, policy experts and journalists    and his closeness to the most senior figures of the saudi government    have helped jubeir has worked to strengthen u.s.-saudi ties.

909,my boyfriend has the same issue but it grew twice the size.    he's had the lump on his inner thigh and    can't feel one of his legs/left leg.    i'm 5'9'' and have long skinny fingers and long hands, it's at least the length of my hand.    however it's gotten black and blue, then turned purple now it's black.    he's getting blue spots on other parts of his leg.    could it be a blood vessel problem and a nerve problem? could it be a circulation problem? could it be skin cancer?! he's 34 going on 35! any idea on what condition it could be?!

911,i am 21 and have really high (like 160/107 high) blood pressure.    my nurse practitioner's answer is to try going off of the birth control pill and see if it will change.    however, i went on the pill seven or so years ago because i have really intense periods (passing clots, bleeding through clothes/pads, horrible cramps throughout period).    someone in the obgyn department at the medical school associated with my undergrad eduction said that my inverted cervix probably leads to the awful periods and could lead to scarring if left untreated.    basically, i'm wondering if i should try to find a way to stay with hormone treatment, especially as my mother got high blood pressure in her 30s because of a heart rate issue?    i really want to have a family at some point...    i don't want possible scarring to interfere with that.    thanks.

920,im going crazy trying to figure this one out. the first day of my last period was on aug. 24 and lasted 3 days. me and my bf had sex on the 30th/31st of august without protection and he came in me. we got the plan b pill in the late evening of the 1st of sept. about 5 days later i had a light pink spotting that i saw just a few times that day. it was very light pink. since then i have yet to have a period. lately though ive been feeling emotional/irritable, the sides of my abdomen are hard, about a week ago i was feeling very nauseous for a few days then it subsided, ive been feeling tired a lot which is abnormal for me.eating more than i usually do (which is never very much at all), cramping in my lower abdomen that comes and goes and just overall feel like i might be pregnant. i have a child already but my pregnancy was quite rough so i knew very early on that i was pregnant. i have taken 3-4 pregnancy tests that have come out negative and a blood test yesterday that came out negative as well. is it still possible i could be??
921,hi, i was just wondering if anyone knew if breast feeding would change my bbt? my hubby gladly gets my dd for me so i dont have to get up but should i be doing my temps before i feed her or is it ok to do it after?
922,my daughter    is increasingly acting out in violent ways towards me (i am a single parent) and nothing seems to help.    i have tried every kind of time out imaginable, restraining her, and even just ignoring her.she will jump on me, grabbing my throat, scratching, kicking, hitting, slapping, and biting.    she will throw chairs, ice packs, my purse, or just about anything in reach.    she will slam doors and scream.other behavior/attitude concerns are: she doesn't want to leave the house, either for school or grocery shopping, or simply to make friends in our neighborhood - she has asked me to not pressure her that she will make friends when she is ready to.she has locked herself in her room before to avoid going to school.she can go on for _hours_ about how 'hard' her life is...listing extremely trivial things...she got tagged it at school with her friends, she stubbed her toe the other day...things like that.i have tried listening sympathetically, as well as telling her to stop the negativity and talk about something positive.she says that she is not sleeping well, that her thoughts won't stop thinking so she can fall asleep easier.she has been in therapy for years already, i called the police this morning, what could be the cause/solution to this kind of behavior?please understand, my daughter is bright, verbally precocious, and capable of holding it together at school etc.she doesn't seem able to know what makes her so angry, or able to take any responsibility for her actions.    she says that i make her throw things, hit, scream, etc. she will completely turn around when others are around, acting as if everything is fine/normal etc.    when i say no it's not, she flies off the handle again as soon as we are alone.she has seen me abused by her paternal grandmother - i left her, got my daughter in therapy, etc.    i know that some anger is normal - but this is not.there is history of mental illness in her family, father was bi-polar, his sister has sever emotional problems, their mother is extremely violent, but again, a charmer when she wants to be, possibly sociopathic?    but i know for certain that her father was schizophrenic.i don't know what to do, at this point her therapist is even out of suggestions.    i plan to take her in to the county hospital today for an evaluation - i just can't think of anything else to do.what could be causing this?
923,i'm 24 just gave birth 1 1/2 months ago. doc. said ok to go back to normal activity. had sex twice before i got my period with bleeding after. then sex and no problem. had first, period since giving birth lasted 7 days, had sex on last day. started bleeding again. now i've had no sex and been having light pinkish/brown spotting. go to doctor on monday. could i get pregnant already or is it just my body getting back to normal. i also lost over 70lbs being pregnant, but ate all the time.
924,my son who is 7 years old got    -7.00    myopia in both the eyes. i heard about an eye instrument (machine) called eyerelax, is it really good and worth buying?
925,my daughter who just turned 5 in april started kindergarten. she has never been to preschool or daycare as i am a stay at home mom. on her assessment test she scored a little low and the teacher acted like maybe i should hold her until she was 6 but then i talked to the counselor who assured me my dd would get intervention and be caught up.her teacher called me at home from her home after only the fifth full day of school and wanted to discuss some things with me. the first thing is that my daughter had her shoe off for whatever reason and took her shoe to the teacher and just held it to her b/c she needed help putting it back on but she wouldn't ask,i should add my child is very shy and reserved especially in a public setting, the teacher told me she asked my child what she needed a few times and she wouldn't answer so she took her out in the hall and sat her down and and told her if she wanted her shoe back on she would have to ask so my child screamed put my shoe on and was upset. the next thing is that she asked them all (there are 26 kids in this class) to take out the blue crayon and my daughter took out pink (she knows her colors) and refused to get blue out so the teacher took the pink crayon away from her and this upset my daughter. she also told me my child has a hard time following 3 and 4 part directions and that that concerns her. she told me it may be a good idea to talk to my child dr. about this. she made me cry because she is acting like there is something wrong with my child! i had a talk with my daughter and she has been doing better on her behavior and at listening to her teacher but the teacher says she is still not catching on like the other children and to talk to her dr. this concerns me. is there something wrong with my child? the teacher says my daughter is the only one out of 26 kids to have these issues, is that believable? this is only her second week of any kind of schooling is this teacher jumping the gun? i feel like she has already singled my child out. sorry this is so long but i am lost, this is the first child i have ever put in school. any advice will be great!thanks in advace,lauren

934,hello all,for some good days now my boobs have been sore and painful. they both feel like they are biting around the nipple and they feel painful all around the breast, starting from close to the chest to the nipple. they are not tender to the touch but when i press or squeeze them in certain places they pain and my nipples feel like the cold air is touching them when i touch them, you get me? now, the right one has this on and off bearable pain that is right under the nipple. it sometimes hurt all around the nipple, it feels a little tender when i touch it where its hurting, i look at my breast and i can she the lines from my stretch marks clearer than usual and the stretch marks under my right breast look like long pink lines. what could this be? i stopped nursing my three year old son when he was just 2 and half years old, so i stopped nursing in nov 05, just a year ago, but i still have some milk left. i am not sure if this is due to my milk drying up and infection or pregnancy because i had a period that was late and lighter than usual though it lasted its reguler 5 days, however the pain began before my last period which was dec 26th 06. i have a very messed up cycle right now but my period is not usually no more that 31 days apart. any pointers guys?? :)
935,long story made short. my wife and i found ourselves only available to attend an easter vigil mass. we have a 2.5 year old and i felt that the expectation for him to endure a 3 hour mass was to great without behavioral problems. my wife and her family believe that we should attend and when the behavioral problems arouse, correct the problem and parent. i felt that we set this child up for failure. our 2.5 year old son had been removed from mass 4 times. my question then is this; what are reasonable expectations for a child of this age group?

945,newark, new jersey (cnn) -- stopped at a red light in a crime-wracked neighborhood of newark, new jersey, a 31-year-old woman watched as her friend slumped to the floor after a bullet smashed through the back window of the 31-year-old's pontiac minivan.i looked back and there was a gunman walking up on my car, said the driver, who declined to be named out of concerns for her safety.i turned away and he fired two more.as the shots rang out, she turned the wheel and hit the gas to escape what turned out to be the second fatal shooting that day in newark, where nearly a sixth of the city's police force was laid off amid budget cuts about two years ago.and newark is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money. meanwhile, violent crime soared 18% nationwide last year, marking the country's first rise since 1993, while property crime also spiked for the first time in a decade.hurry up, i can't breathe, mouthed wounded bronique mcleod, after the gunman unloaded three rounds at the minivan where she was sitting with her friends just before midnight on october 1.the group then raced toward newark's university hospital, but the 24-year-old mother of two began to lose consciousness.one of the bullets had punctured her lung, her family said later.when they got her on the gurney she kept saying 'i'm dying, i'm dying,' the driver recalled. 'please don't let me die. i have two kids.'mcleod hung on until about 3 a.m. the next day, just hours after another victim died in a hail of gunfire in an unrelated incident about a mile away in the city's south ward.her death is one of at least 71 homicides so far this year in cash-strapped newark, where police say they have reorganized after more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in november 2010. last year the city tallied 74 murders through october, while violent crime soared despite earlier drops in the first years of mayor cory booker's administration.police expenditures in newark have since declined every year for the last three years, according to the city's business administrator, julien x. neals, leaving cops to sustain public services with decreasing resources.analysts say the trend isn't unique.most cities have cut back since 2008 and the recession, though some more than others, said gregory minchak, a spokesman for the national league of cities.municipal administrators nationwide have since struggled to fill budget gaps amid declines in state aid, a sputtering economy, high employment and slowly rising costs in things like health care and public pensions.according to the washington-based cities organization, the effects of the financial crisis are also increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012, after dropping 3.9% nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services.in short, the overall pie has gotten smaller, say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in newark in 2010.we've been in process of reducing our expenses pretty aggressively for the last three years, said neals, who touted improvements in the city's tax collection efforts to help with the revenue side of the equation.naturally there's a period where the rubber hits the road and there's not that much left to cut.but last year newark ended up with an $18 million surplus in state aid, prompting republican gov. chris christie to state that he wasn't happy with the city's 2012 requests for more assistance.i don't need new jersey's largest city in any more financial trouble than it's in already, the governor told reporters earlier this month, dispatching state officials to force budget cuts.still, in 2010, newark's mayor said police layoffs were an unfortunate situation that was entirely avoidable, and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis. booker said improvements in technologies and partnerships with federal agencies would help in the fight against crime, and pledged to sustain the number of officers patrolling the streets.but city police union vice president james stewart has argued that both patrols and detective squads have since been reduced, and that all the technology in the world won't replace the bodies you need to respond to crime and build proactive policing.meanwhile, town and city halls in places including detroit, michigan; jacksonville, florida; kansas city, missouri; and scranton, pennsylvania, have tentatively put public sector jobs on the chopping block this year to help fill budget gaps.in january, the mayor of crime-ridden camden, new jersey, nearly halved its police force while cutting close to a third of its fire department in an effort to close a $26.5 million budget deficit.and as america's fiscal health continues to assume center stage on the campaign trail, how the nation will deal with its debts in the days after november is largely expected to play out in some way on the streets of cities like newark, detroit and camden.a silver lining may be that it's finally forcing the discussion.we're now having that frank public conversation about what do we want from government and how much do we want to pay for it, said brookings institution fellow tracy gordon.law enforcement typically makes up large portions of most municipal budgets and is often considered a prime target for cutbacks.every department is facing the same kind of issues of downsizing, said newark police director samuel demaio.everybody has significantly less amount of police officers and you know there has to be a point where that comes to an end.newark residents such as latasha watson, who was a close friend of mcleod's, say they've become frustrated with the response from police, though they are equally disturbed by the so-called snitch code that keeps neighborhood witnesses quiet and away from authorities out of fear of retribution.newark is listed as one of only a handful of new jersey cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members, according to a state survey. i know (police) are overwhelmed, watson said. people are dying but we want cops on the street doing something, she added.earlier this month, police arrested a 42-year-old city resident who is suspected in mcleod's murder.source: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/28/us/new-jersey-newark-crime/index.html?hpt=us_c2
946,hello,as you all know i got a bfp last wk.and will be getting my u/s on monday also a 4th beta.dr. said my #'s sound good(1031) but i'm still worried.after my ectopic 8/25,i'm a bit parinoid.. please keep me in your thoughts & prayers.i will be updating on monday..thanks...nanis
947,what in the world should i do???my husband and i had a miscarriage over a year ago or so...and, right after i had my miscarriage was confirmed by a doctor through a blood test. when the nurse called me back to double confirm that i was indeed having a miscarriage, i asked her if i would have to go back in to get checked out, or have some follow up testing done or something....but she said i didn't have to go back ever again if i didn't want to...or something like that..you know, basically just to reassure me that i didn't need to go back because i was supposedly fine. the only thing she did tell me to do was to hold off on trying to make a baby for at least 3 to 4 months or so that my body could fully recover. the reason why i am asking if i should still have follow up testing...(even though it's almost two years since the miscarriage)...is because, my husband and i have been trying ever since father's day of 2010 to make a baby...and now it's already january 4th 2011...and we still aren't pregnant. it's just been a little discouraging. my other questions are, what are the specific, and best days to conceive each month? how can i tell if i'm ovulating (without a ovulation predictor kit)? is it possible that i am no longer able to conceive? did the nurse make a mistake by telling me not to come back for a check up or follow up? have i not fully recovered? is there something wrong with me due to the miscarriage and the effects it had on my body? is it possible to not ever conceive again after a miscarriage? i have heard so many things...i am confused. it is just concerning me that it is taking so long to get pregnant. the first time was really easy. my husband and i had tried for about 4 months...and then we got pregnant. it all went by so fast...and it seemed effortless. now it seems like such a struggle for us to conceive. what should i do?--ksh09
948,okay well, i just got off the phone with him and he was crying himself we really love each other he said he is gonna come see me and i so want to believe him but i dont know what to do i am so scared of a heart break i am not on drugs or prostituting neither i am a happy 18 year old woman and love makes u do stupid things but he is the first man i have been with and i dont understand this we have never done this before weve been together for a year and a half and have been through trials and tribulations like weve been together for 5 years. he said he is gona come see me and he apoligized for what he did i am gonna stay at my moms and try to get it together but i want him in my life i love him with all my heart and i really have no one else to turn to i think about myself all the time and sometimes that is the problem i am trying to make it i just turned 18 last month and already going through problems i really enjoy hearing you guys and it makes me feel like i have a family on here thank you and i will keep you posted on the situation
949,i am a 22 yr old female, suffering from panic attacks/ anxiety. i take 75mg of zoloft, just recently increased dosage from 50mg. i have been going threw alot more stress lately. i am in love w/ another person and still with my boyfriend of 4 yrs. we live together. this other guy i met is also very serious about me and wants to get a place w/ me. i can see myself happy w/ him and us doing well together. the problem is everytime i get ready to tell my b/f that im leaving i chicken out. i instantly start getting the wave of fear and i dont understand why. im so scared to leave and not feel comfortable in my new place. is this because i have lived here for the past 4yrs? i feel like im losing my damn mind and i dont no what to do. i cant keep living my life like this. the medication im on should be helping. i have heard about people w/ anxiety having a safe zone or spot, could this be what i feel is mine? the house im living in? please anyone out there give me some advice. is this normal to feel like this? am i out of my mind?
950,i recently went on a ski trip to park city.    i took my pills as perfectly as possible and on the day we left and on the day we left i had bad break-through bleeding on the plane (it went through my pants).    i've been on the pill for 5 years and this has never happened, not even in the first few months.    is this a pill failure or due to altitude?    should i be worried about pregnancy?    after the trip we started using condoms just in case but went unprotected during the trip.
951,hello!the expertforum doesn't work, that's why i ask here.i had a    x-raytest with barium. doctor said to wait 30 min and that then somebody did a photo of my stomach. but a nurse calles me in 20 min and did the photo. yes, i am fool, that i didn't objekt to this, but it is to late for this. so, in general, the doctor come to the conclusion on the grounds of the foto, that the bariumpassage is retarded from the stomach to the duodenum and through the duodenum. could it be a diagnosis because of untaking,that the foto was done    not in 30 min, but in 20? and could you assess    with help of this foto the bariumpassage from the stomach to and through the duodenum?thank you and sorry for my english

957,this morning i went to the bathroom and there was nothing there. after i got to work i went to the bathroom and saw like a pea sized amount of light pink something in my undies. and when i wiped there was a little smear of light pink. yesterday i woke up with really sore nipples, but not sore breasts. what is strange about is that i never have sore nipples, like ever. i also felt a strange lump i've never felt before on the right side of my right breast. i've also woken up with a strange metallic taste in my mouth a few times. my period isn't due until next week, but a little over a week ago i had what felt very similar to period cramps, just a little milder. i have also woken up feeling sick, i have even gotten sick a once or twice but blamed on light drinking the night before. sometimes when i pee i feel a light pain in the lower right side of my abdomen.i've been complaining about my different symptoms to my mom, and she's is starting to think i sound pregnant and i'm getting really worried.what i might also add is that i have been on birth control for over 3 years but earlier this month was put on antibiotics for a bacterial infection.based on what i've said does it sound like i should begin to worry? does it sound like i experienced implantation spotting?i already have a ob appointment scheduled for 2 pm tomorrow, and i'm gonna request a blood pregnancy test. i just want to get some opinions from other people who have first hand experienced this.
958,as you may know, from my other questions. i have irregular periods so its hard for me to know when to expect my next period. i am getting insurance through work on the 4th of feb, and thats when i will be going to get my periods regular and such. so anyways, usually when i get a period its really heavy with really bad cramps, you know, the whole period stuff. well i've been waiting since feb '09 for a period, which is pretty normal for me, but irregular in general.on wednesday, jan 27th, i couldn't sleep, got up to use the bathroom, and seen brown on the toilet paper, but nothing in the toilet. now this is weird 4 me b/c i usually dont have any brown until after a period. so i put a pad on, thinking i would be starting soon. well, i finally fell asleep at 6am. than when i woke up at 1-2pm, i went to the bathroom and it was a light pink when i wiped, and a little tiny blood clot in the toilet, and the pad had a little brown on it, like spotted.now its back to brown, 3 days later, still brown. well anyways, im starting to feel a little gurgling(hard 2 explain, best way 2 put it) in my lower stomach, not cramps, but weird feeling. still no period? light brown is starting to lighten up so now, its almost gone. breast have been tender and kinda sore for a couple weeks now....appetite is crazy.--if i eat, ill be hungry 2hrs later, which isnt normal 4 me.*if you have experience in this moms, or to-be moms. please share! i need all the advice/help i can get before i go to doctor on feb 4th.**btw- took 2 pregnancy tests 2 days agofirst one didn't show a faint line until 3-5mins later and it was really faint.second one never showed a faint line, it was a clear negative.****i've had a false positive before, so i'm not going to go by those 2 tests. i will wait until the 4th. but i wanna know if anyone else has experienced this when they found out if they were pregnant?*********i wanna add that i have always had pretty good complexion, even with a period. and for some weird reason my forhead has been breaking out and drying up really bad! i have 2 put lotion on it everyday. and im 21 not a teen =)
959,i had posted another question earlier that i missed my period last month and had a negative preg. test. things have changed in a few hours. now i am spotting and its brown but light and is mixed with clear discharge. i do have a cyst on my left ovary. mind that i did take the preg. test 2 days ago and i am a month late so there has been a chunk of time that has passed so if i was preg. it should have come out positive but came out negative. i am 20 years old.
960,okay, looks like more information coming to light. they apparently were well warned by the cia of the pending attack.url: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57510158/ny-times-reporter-bush-white-house-didnt-listen-to-9-11-warnings/
961,i had my day 3 retrieval on friday, 5/21 and ever since wed 5/26 have been off and on experiencing quick, sharp pains in/near one ovary or the other when i stand up quickly or cough, sneeze, or blow my nose. i know my ivf team said if i am pregnant, i might feel the same full/bloated feeling i had while on stims leading up to retrieval, but this is nothing like that. it's very quick and sharp and almost makes me cry out. anyone else experience this? is it a good/bad/neutral sign? i still have 4 days until beta.
962,i have done 2 rounds of the hcg diet using the homeopathic drops and had a total loss of 32 pounds.    i did my first round in april '11 and the second round 6 weeks later.    about 3 weeks after the second round i started to have significant hair loss.    i am still experiencing hair loss and estimate my loss to be at about 60%.    thank goodness i had lots of hair to start with!    i would recommend to anyone interested in doing this diet that you have at least 2-3 months between rounds and only do the rounds for the minimum 23 days.    dr. simeon does mention this as a possible side effect but i didn't realize he meant this much hair loss.    he contends that the hair will grow back... i hope so!    i loved the diet otherwise and didn't experience any other negative side effects.
963,i'm having a itch around my vaginal area and right at the outer of my vaginal hole there is dry skin all over. sometimes when i scratch too hard the lips around my vagina tends to hurt alot. can you please advice me on this.

965,i just noticed the top of my iris in both eyes have turned milky white in color. (i have brown eyes) it is about 1 mm in width and extends over the tpo portion of both eyes. could this be due to improperly fitted contacts? or some other eye problem?    the reason i noticed it is because i examined my eyes after my contacts ( 1 month wear) seemed to be irritating my eyes- had itchy, slightly red eyes for about 1 1/2 weeks then started wearing glasses

972,so, recently my boyfriend has made me realize what a horrible girlfriend i am and now i'm questioning the stability of our relationship. we have been pretty rocky for the past month and i think it's all my fault. we were talking about why our relationship seems like its going downhill and he goes when was the last time you initiated a makeout session? it really made me think. its true. i am rarely ever the one to initiate any intimacy. i don't know if its me being too shy or self-conscious to initiate anything or if maybe subconsciously i'm not really into him. i feel really bad about this because this is the one thing that i knew would ruin our relationship: my super-low self confidence. if i were more confident i think it would be easier for me to come on to him, but since i always feel ugly or overweight, i never seen to gain the courage to do anything. but when he comes on to me i'm really excited about that because its like oh yay, he's still into me, phew. but now i'm thinking i can't leave all the work to him. i asked him what i could do and at this point he said i'm so over sex right now because i feel like i have to do all the work and now i'm not even in the mood. so this made me feel really bad because i never thought it would get this bad. some guys like to be the one in control, but i guess he doesn't. i would like to work up the courage to be more in control too, but i don't even know where to start now. i feel really discouraged. anyone else ever had this problem? i would love any advice. thank you.
973,i was diagnosed with blepharitis following eye surgery about 6 months ago. i have brought it under control a bit but have been unable to get the stuff off my eyelids. i have also noticed a fuzzy feeling around the eye (dry eyes?). i am currently doing warm compresses twice a day, lid scrubs and use sterilid but the eyelashes are still crusted by the base (doctor noted he did not see mites). is there anything else i can be doing and can the fuzzy feeling be due to the dryness or clogged glands (i also have clogged pores in the eye)?
974,i had a two minute episode of, the only way i can describe it is horizontal zigzag in one eye only.    it was almost like a floater in the way it travelled (slowly, moving up) and was more to the outside of the left eye.    completely resolved very quickly.???????
975,hello folks,hopefully someone can kindly find an answer for me.my sister has been on 25mg minocycline for a few months in order to treat an infection. now she wants to have a child (1st). but she is deeply concerned about the possible side-effects of any residual minocycline in her body.she had consulted with several doctors and the answers varied from no need to worry, you may try to conceive immediately after you finish with this drug to wait six months.    i have searched google for medical citations and have come up with nothing in regards to any related to a waiting period.can anyone point to anything that discusses a waiting period or not?thank you so much!sdc
976,i recently had a ct scan and the iv was inserted into my hand.    the technician said that this is much more painful than an arm insertion because it expands the veins and there is less fat in the hand.    this was nerly a week ago and for two days after the test, i had very, very limited use of my whole forearm and now 6 days later continue to have protruding veins in my hand and up past my wrist as well as residual pain (especially when i let that arm fall to my side).    what causes this and is this a normal side effect?
977,thank you to everyone who gave me advice...i am getting a 2nd opinion on my tubal..hopefully it will be good news, wish me luck!!

985,well i came off birth control pills last october.    my first period was 27days later, then i had two months where it was 30days and last month 28 days. last month, i finally thought, at last my period is regulated.    i was supposed to start my period last tuesday but nothing, then today has been day 30 and even though it is still early in the day, nothing so far.    my breasts have been hurting me since last saturday.    could i just be confusing this with period symptoms.    i don't really wanna take a pregnancy test and get my hope up and then be let down for no reason.has anyone had a similar experience.    i would appreciate any input.
986,ho hum. so, i'm 11 dpo/cd28 and got a neg with a frer. i am sooo bloated today. i never get bloated before af.    i haven't had any cm most of the tww, but starting yesterday i have watery cm. i'm soooo tired! and i also have a headache, but i think these might be due to my allergies. my sinuses are sore when i press on them, so i know i'm dealing with spring allergens. i still have a low grade pukey feeling on and off. bbs are sore, but not as badly as yesterday. just want to know if this is af coming or not. i think tomorrow's test will be the tell-all. i feel like if i'm going to get an accurate test it's going to be on 12dpo and that's tomorrow. not feeling terribly hopeful at this point :0(ssbd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~sue
987,ihello, after my recent laparoscopy/hysteroscopy the doctor confirmed the fibroids, but could not confirm adenomyosis; he stated that could only be done for sure after the hysterectomy with the pathology report.        i was told that my ovary contained a variocele that might be caused by endometriosis, but he did not was to touch it during the laparoscopy because he did not want chance it. he would remove it during my hysterectomy surgeryhe appeared very concerned about one particular fibroid, and then preceded to tell me about a rare form of cancer arising from fibroids and how some doctors never see this cancer in their life time. he however, has seen it 5 times as he kept tapping the photo.    so, i asked am i number 6?    he would not answer me, either way.    my surgery is scheduled for september, i could not have it sooner, and he would have. i wanted to wait until the first of the year, he wanted it next month. we compromised.all i know is this particular fibroid, there are many others on the uterus, but this one is different, containing, strange white outgrowths out of the top of it and very visible blood vessels. cool looking color photo and my friend joked stating the fibroid had a yeast infection.    (does that give you a visual?)has anyone ever heard of anything like this?he also told me i would need a vertical abdominal cut to make sure he had the best view to get everything i feel like he might not be totally telling something.oh, before i forget, when i asked why he did not biopsy or remove it during my last surgery, he stated he did not want it to break off inside.    hum?i might be able to scan the photo and upload it.

1004,hi,i've been having issues with my hair breaking in the center of head for about 3 1/2 years. recently a small spot in the back of my head has randomly startied to break too. my hair just won't stop splitting, everytime i shampoo or comb it theres hair everywhere. i'm an african american female and my hair is thick to say the least, it's not thinning it just keeps breaking and splitting like crazy in the same spot. i don't have issues like dry scalp or dandruff, or any bumps to my knowledge. my scalp itches sometimes, but it's not an all day everyday issue for me. i wash and condition my hair at least 2 times a week and try to keep it moisturized.i recently saved up money to visit a dermatologist and was diagnosed when folliculitis, all the guy did was barely touch my scalp. he says it's bumpy, although i beg to differ, he's the professional so i took his word.    i was prescribed the doctor's own brand of hair products (shampoo containing salycylic acid and sulfur and conditioner) along with dipronex lotion (which really dries out my hair). one of the possible side effects of the dipronex is folliculitis...why would he prescribe it for me? i was wondering what's a way to deal with scalp folliculitis with otc products?i'm at my wit's end :(         ...any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! :)

1013,i do not have periods and recent hormone tests show i have low progesterone (0.5) levels. all other hormone levels are good and ovaries look good. my doctor gave me 200 mg of natural progesterone pills that my doctor compounded for me to take once a day. she said to take them for three weeks and then go off for one week and to continue this for at least 3 months. will this process cause me to ovulate since it will be regulating my progesterone? do i need to worry about pregnancy? my doctor said i definitely be using some form of birth control but everything i read says that progesterone supplements will stop ovulation. i should also add that i would like to get pregnant soon :-) thanks for any replies!
1014,i went to see a doctor after i posted my concerns (please see subject: lingering birth control side effects...or something worse?). i was diagnosed with genital warts. so i got the aldara cream and just after 2 applications 1 of the warts (i have 3) is completely gone and the other 2 are almost gone. one of the 2 that are remaining was supposedly the biggest according to the doctor and she said it would take weeks for it to go away. she said i can stop using the cream when there are no visible warts. my questions are:1) i've read/heard that aldara is very potent but does it really work this fast? it's just been 2 days (i apply it every other day-3 times a week-as prescribed).2) also i was told not to shave b/c the warts can spread but does that mean in the area where the warts are (near the vaginal opening-no hair there) or in the general vicinity (as in nowhere down there)?3) i'm supposed to get my period this week. should i use tampons or pads?4) is it okay to wear thongs?i leave for vacation tomorrow and it would be nice to not think about this (and to shave). any advice would be greatly appreciated. thank you.

1019,i had cataracts removed five years ago, now i am wondering if i have 'dry eye syndrome'? sometimes my eyes are gritty, with stringy mucus, i tend to draw my finger across the eye to get this stretchy mucus out, i know this is wrong as i introduce infection, then end up with conjunctavitis! if i am outdoors and am bending my head then tears flow down my cheeks and i    have to blow my nose.i bought some hypermelose drops which sometimes help, also i have found bathing my eyes in cooled boiled salt water, and taking a piriton tablet. so i am not sure if i am suffering dry eyes or hay fever, but this is all year round i suffer?this driving me to distraction now! i am 64 so i expect it is due to old age!!! thank you lin

1024,i had a frozen embryo transfer on 12/29/06.    my first hcg showed 140, 2 days later, it only goes up to 170.    no double.    what's that mean??? does the embryo developes or not? can anyone help?
1025,my grandma notcied last night that my right eye was bloodshot looking. well i brushed it off, but now this morning both eyes have broken blood vessels in them, and plus when you move the eye underneath they are completetly red under    too. what caused this? my eyes dont hurt, but they are really red. and what should i do??
1026,i have irregular periods, caused by pcos (usually 28-35 day cycles) about 4 days ago i noticed a tiny pink spot when i wiped. 2 days later i noticed a bit more, only this time it was more red/dark pink along with very mild cramping. i thought my period had come but that night i only had a few drops of brown blood. the mild cramping turned into slight aching in my lower stomach (often near my left ovary), and watery clear discharge. with my first pregnancy i remember having pretty bad cramps about a week before i found out, but now i have pretty much no discomfort, no breast pain, no nothing. if this was my period i'm sure it would have started full force by now.would implantation cause symptoms/spotting like this, even though i have little to no other pregnancy symptoms? when should i test?
1027,hi, i am a teacher and teach 5-6 yrs olds.    there is a child in    my year group who was ok in class last year, but this year has become an absolute nightmare. he is uncontrollable - fighting and kicking students and teachers alike, and now frequently (several times a week) has to be removed from the classroom by several teachers - for the safety of the children and class teacher.    he has a noticable large and square head and i wondered if this was the symptom of a known syndrome or such?the dramatic change in his behaviour is also very significant.    we are mainly interested in trying to diagnose a cause and so accelerate some help for this child.we have referred him to the educational psychologists but this will take months/years to happen.    we wondered if there were any tips how to manage him in the meantime
1028,i am taking anti-depresants first was citalopram that apart from a whole bunch of side affects also made me gain lots of weight i am now taking mirtazapine and worried they are going to make the weight gain worse,am desperate to lose the weight but still need to take medication for depression, how do i do both ?
1029,a few days ok i started spotting very mildly. just alittle brownish when i wiped. i went to the doc. ay 6 weeks 5 days by my last period. he said my cervix was closed and the blood was old blood but when they did an internal ultrasound they saw the baby but no heartbeat. he is following up with hcg level testing. should i be worried he said it may be alittle early for the heartbeat but im still so nervous. when should i see the heartbeat?
1030,i have been on yasmin for 18 months and in this time i seem to have developed high blood pressure, floaters in my eyes and aura (ocular migraines).    i have always had low bp before on other pills. i was put on yasmin as i was on dianette for acne and that cleared it up although i was on diamette too long so had to come off. yasmin was my new alternative.i have since been taken off yasmin due to the aura episode and been prescribed cerazette (although not taking it yet) but i am most interested to know that is there anything in yasmin bcp that could have caused my blood pressure to rise and my eye floaters to appear? can the two be related?i am a 31yr old female who has never had any health issues until now.thanksemma

1039,hey guys...so, heres the deal; i currently have a 7 month old son and stupidly had two depo shots under our gp's advice after having fallen pregnant with ds on the pill and not wanting to concieve(conceive)to quickly after having him.however, since then i have read many articles about the long term effects that depo can have on fertility. on top of this, i have pcos, hashimotos disease and also a retroverted uterus which are all known to effect fertility.so, dh and i decided that instead of having the next depo shot that we would try for another child, with the knowledge that it could take approx 12 months to conceive.i have not yet had a period since having my last shot over 4 months ago but have been having similar syptoms(symptoms)to those i had whilst pregnant with my son. i've had bloating, pains, a tight abdomen, sore breasts and headaches. no nausea yet though, thank god!!i have taken a hpt which was negative and am planning to visit our gp but until then, i was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if anyone else is able to share their experiences with depo shots and conception?thanks xx
1040,ok so basically i had the mirena insterted in september of 2011, after having months of cramping and bleeding i had it checked and sure enough it had moved. after an attempt to find it with an ultrasound i was scheduled to have it surgically removed. well, 3 days after appointment was booked i felt the strings. my doc checked and sure enough there they were and she grabbed it and removed it. this was on the 12th of december 2011. the week prior i had a pregnancy test just to make sure and it was negative. well my husband and i only get to see each other every couple of months so of course we have plenty of intercourse during our time together. from the 17th of dec 2011 to the 26th of dec 2011 we had intercourse once every day if not twice, and we werent careful. one or two of those days i noticed the tell tale sign of ovulation, you know that pinch and cramping. on the 27th of dec i woke up nauseated and lasted for a few hours. during the day i noticed i just felt off and weird...headache all day, moodyness, heart palpitations, really thick milky white discharge (more than usual) with no odor and some cramping/bloated feeling. 28th woke up again nauseated and with a headache, heart palpitations, discharge, tender nipples, dizzy/light headed feeling,a little congested. woke up 29 dec and felt normal other than of course heart palpitations, discharge and all the rest except nausea...ok so i go about my day. later on that day i get nauseated all over again. i have yet to get my period maybe its just me hoping, but im thinking its way too soon to conceive. well the morning of the 29th of dec i got an hcg qual done at the clinic i work at and it was negative. is it too soon to tell or is it even possible to conceive immediately after removal of the mirena. please help me im so confused and i have no one to talk to being that my husband is over 13 hours away from me. help!!
1041,i had a root canal on tooth #12, 3 weeks ago. i started having pain the next day and it getting worse as the days go on. i called the dentist 2 time in the first 2 week and they said it was normal. i went in for the crown start up at 2 weeks. i explained to my general dentist that i was still in pain. she set me up to see the root canal dentist the next day. he x-ray it again and said things look good. that i have 3 options1. root canal over for 835.00 insurance will not cover.2. cut the gum and go in that way    costing over $1000. that insurance may not cover.3. removing the tooth and then having to put a bridge or inplant. all costing crazy amounts that the insurance may not cover.my question is if it looks good then why am i in pain. why would the dentist not just do another root canal with out charging me since he missed something the first time.which one do i choose, i need to be out of pain since i struggle with depression. the pain is only making it worse.thank you
1042,i have been a smoker for 13 years. (horrible, i know) anyway, i finally decided to quit since i believe that is causing me even more fertility issues than i seem to already have. my question is; will it be beneficial for me that i quit smoking even if it was only 6 days prior to my iui?????    i know in the long run it'll help, but will it help me through this current cycle of treatment?

1048,i know someone that her baby is about 8wks old. i found out that she is giving her baby water like if    the baby needs it. what do you guys think? i know that babies don't need water until 6 months i think.
1049,i have been struggling off and on with my son's behavior for the last two years.    we have a secure family unit with both parents at home, and we have an older daughter, aged 8 1/2.    both have been in daycare or school most of their lives, but i spend virtually every other minute after a regular 8-5 work day with them and on the weekends.    my son is very attached to me, and does not want to be separated from me at all.    he doesn't want to go to school, even though he attends a very nice, loving preschool (and having the same teachers his sister had, i know it is not part of the problem), he only wants to stay home with me.    if he needs a glass of milk or a blanket, etc., it is always me that has to get it or perform the task.    his dad is more than willing, and his sister is good to him too, aside from the occasional sibling disagreement, but he says no, i want mommy to do it.    this, i would not be too concerned about, but some days he throws temper tantrums at school where a teacher gets kicked and today he attempted to bite the counselor who was trying to escort him to class.    he is very intelligent and in many cases i believe he does it so i have to come to school for a conference, etc.    his dad has a rather long commute, so it is me that would have to take care of these issues.    that said, i am concerned he is nearing a possible suspension (horrid thought for a 4k student!), and we have to make some changes.    i considered changing our routine to take every privilege away as a rule and make him earn those daily rather than taking away things when he is bad.    i also wonder if, because he seems to act out to get my undivided attention, it wouldn't be prudent to remove mom, and by that i mean tell him if he behaves as he should that he and i will do some special activity together just he and i for x minutes.    force him to allow his dad and sister (or teachers in the case of school) to nurture him more than i, and refuse him when he demands that i am the one to perform the task.    if i truly thought it was because he didn't have enough attention from me, i would drop everything and give him that, but i think it is more an issue of being spoiled because he is the baby, and for many years, he has been the one that life revolved around.    does anyone have suggestions for me, or comments on these two ideas?
1050,hii need ur help regarding my daughter who is 3.5 yrs old.actually last 1 year has been a transitional phase for us .so inspite of her being 3.5 yrs i could    not send her to school.v have shifted to the u.s just 15 days back .now through out the day me and my daughter r at home as my husband goes to office.now my problem is that my daughter is very very talkative.she keeps on saying some thing or the other and i think she lacks concentration a lot.1 min she wants to see barbie and then after 5 min she wants to see barney,then after another 5 min she wants to play ball like this ......she doesnt concentrate in 1 thing,even while studing the things r same.writing alphabet she will write 1 alphabet and then keep staring at the walls or start singing songs.my concern is that--1. how do i build this concentration thing in her.bcoz of christmas and all she can start goin to scool only in mid jan.2.and abt her talking much ,should i say her to keep quite for some time or should i let talking so much b as it is. and will this behavoiur will change on its own??????
1051,my husband comes to me two nights ago and tells me he got a friend request on fb from some woman from his home town. she looks much older then him in her pic he said but may be an ex from high school. i look at pic with him say i think she is about his age ( he looks younger)    said it can't be ex b/c different last name duh she is married it said her maiden name too. now, i commend him for being so honest with me. and things are going great with us. it is just that i thought things were going great before two. you see he seems to get caught up in the attention of other people. i realize it stems from insecurity from childhood being abandoned and all but he said he is no way insecure in our relationship now. the thing is it is eating at me. i guess this is the true test of his honesty. but i hate feeling this way.

1057,no rubbing of eyes all day.    i was looking at my computer screen and then glanced away. this action made me flinch as i thought something was in my eye.    having had a shard of metal there years ago i knew enough not to rub it but instead to go after a mirror.    i did so but didn't see anything there at all.    i lifted my eye lid and looked at the inner corner where the pain was.    it looked normal except there is an air gap between the lid,eye ball, and just above the muscle(?) in the corner.    looking at the other eye there is no gap and makes the bad eye seem like 1/2 the muscle has disappeared.    the pain is intermittent with no known pattern of eye movement.    this was a sudden happening with no apparent cause.i have a regular follow up appointment with my pcp in the morning (followed by the cardiologist two hours later) and will have her take a look.    she is not very good at all and i'll be dumping her soon simply because she doesn't want to know anything about two conditions i have, heart and ear problems, she want the specialist to have excusive care of these).    in the mean time, even though there's not much information available in this post, does anyone have some suggestions to what this could be?
1058,we painted a couple of rooms in the house with semi gloss in april. my mother got very ill and started sleeping outside. we talked to the paint company and they told us to use kilz and try again. we did. still no good. the company said to have professionals come and paint. we did. the paint company did give us all the money back and also paid the contractors. but here it is 6 months later and we are both still very sick.we are coughing, dizzy, extremely tired, having headaches and many more problems.we bought an odor free ozone machine and that's not helping either.any suggestions? we just want our house to be livable again and we would like to be living.
1059,imagine this. you are in a good mood today. there  s something you are really happy about and you decide to tell your friend to share the excitement. however, your friend listens mainly in nonchalance while you are gushing away. worse still, he/she starts giving his/her 2 cents about how it  s not really not that great. talk about a wet blanket! before you know it, your mood has done a 180 degree switch from happy to one of annoyance and irritation.does this sound familiar? this is a typical behavior of critical people. critical people can be real downers, just like energy vampires. no matter what you say, they always find some way to derail the mood of the conversation. you can  t ever remember when  s the last time they ever gave a compliment or encouragement. they have an uncanny ability to scrutinize and zoom into every little problem there is. following which, they fixate on these issues and offer unwanted opinions on them. if that  s not enough, they top it off with their projection of all the possible bad things that can happen.in my article on are you emotionally generous?, i shared why we should be cut out the emotional stinginess and why emotional generosity is the way to go. critical people are emotionally stingy, because they are so bent on harping on   flaws   and what  s not there. they seem to have an automatic filter which mentally blocks out whatever goodness before them. rather than give praise, they can only criticize.8 helpful ways to deal with critical peoplenaturally, critical people aren  t the first people you  d think of hanging out with. while you can try to get out of their way, you are bound to run into one or two of them in school or at work. here are my 8 handy ways to handle them:1. don  t take it personallymost of the times, their criticisms reflect more about themselves than about you. they react in this manner because of certain beliefs and frameworks they have about life. you may think the critical person is all out to get you, but it  s more likely he/she reacts in this same manner toward everyone else too.here  s one simple way to check    think about the common friends you have with the critical person. if possible, identify people of the same standing as you, so it  s comparable. after this, try to be present the next time they are with each other and observe how the critical person interacts with him/her. how does the critical person behave? does he/she give the same pattern of comments? does he/she focus on the negative things? does he/she come across as critical? chances are high that it  s going to be a yes.last time, i used to take a critical friend  s comments to heart. i  d wonder why she was always so discouraging, and would feel defensive when she voiced out with her unwelcomed criticism. however, when i observed her treatment of our common friends, i realized she did this with the others too. same comments, same criticisms, same hang-ups with them, even though i never saw anything wrong with our common friends. not only that, there was a trend in what she said and harped on. it was then i realized it wasn  t about me; it was her inner frameworks. it was a liberating realization. from there on, i no longer took anything she said personally and was able to objectify the situation.2. understand their real messagesometimes, i feel critical people are just misunderstood. they may just trying to offer an opinion but it becomes misinterpreted due to their lack of tact. at times this swirls into a big misunderstanding. they become labeled as *ssholes even though they really aren  t trying to be.unfortunately, people become hung up over   how   communication is done (the words used, the tone of communication), rather than   what   is being communicated (the message). the former ensures the message is conveyed correctly, but ultimately it is the message that matters. critical people may be curt, but we are the ones who choose to attach the negativity to their words. critical people may lack tact, but that  s because they lack awareness of how their behavior implicate others. you may be surprised, but sometimes they are really just clueless on how they are coming across until they see themselves in action. if you are taking their comments negatively when they don  t intend to be negative at all, that  s probably the worst way to expend your energy.filter through their words (more importantly, your interpretations of their words) and get down to the real message. what are they trying to communicate? why are they saying these? what are their intentions? are they really trying to be *ssholes or is it a different intention? behind their words may lie great insights. if you can get past the   how   and get down to the   what  , you gain access to valuable feedback for improvement. two power things occur here    firstly, you are a step ahead in your journey of conscious living because you are no longer behaving in a reactive manner. secondly, you are literally more knowledgeable now you know the real intent of their feedback. this can be constructively used in your journey of self-improvement. neither of these can happen if you are hung up over the criticism.the previous company i worked at is an american mnc, so the communication was often direct and to the point. there were times when people would be overly curt and blunt, especially when caught in pressing situations and tight timelines. one of the general managers was well known for his fiery temper, lashing out with verbal attacks and swearing at people when things were not going well. while some might gasp at this behavior, there is really no reason to take offense, because that  s just how he chooses to communicate. of course it  d be ideal if everyone communicates in a sociably tactful manner, but ultimately you can  t change how others act. you can however, change how you perceive something. what really matters is the message the person is trying to convey, more than what exactly is being said.needless to say, the ones who chose to take comments in negative light put themselves through unnecessary unhappiness; the ones who sieved through the words and got to the essence of the message were able to improve based on the feedback. my past experience has made me more perceptive because rather than focus on exact words being said, i listen to what the person is communicating. the ability to actively   listen   beyond words is critical for all of us in connecting and building strong relationships.for the rest:http://celestinechua.com/blog/2010/02/8-helpful-ways-to-deal-with-critical-people/

1061,im 24, single mom of two and live with my parents.my son is 4 and started school this year in pre-k. i was hoping that interacting with others would calm him down and open him up, but i was wrong.his history. he was born at 41 weeks, had no problems except for the webing under his tongue need to be cut so he could feed properly. he was colic bad up until 4 months, after that he developed cronic(chronic)constipation which went undiegnosed till age 2 where he was tested, xrayed, seen a specialist and had more things done to him a grown man would run from. he is an extreamly picky eater which makes it very hard to make him eat regular food. he is literally 28 lbs at 4 yrs old and was 20 lbs for 2 years. his sister is 5 (10 1/2 months apart) and they have the usual fights like all siblings do.okay more for mental issues: his father and me are not together due to fights. at 2 years old i remember his father screaming at him one day because he came home very stressed and i was busy with cooking so i couldnt really tend to the kids(they were fussy and crying).( wonderful military for you) soon after i left my husband because of abuse.once my kids and i moved i noticed he was having nightmares and crying in his sleep, it took awhile for him to get over those. he started to act out at 3 yrs old. screaming, crying, throwing himself on the ground, hitting his head on things, hitting himself and just being dificult.he started being agressive to his sister who is terrified of him when he gets angry. he will throw toys at her, hit, kick and even bite her. at school i get the same talk. he hits other kids and hits his teacher, screams, throws his food and will not calm down. he has these fits several times in a 5 hour period.i've tried talks with him, being calm, time out, taking away toys and it just doesnt work. he is so short tempered, anything will set him off, even positive praise when he is good. very quiet, shy, loving.i think all this might be tied to the over whelming pain he delt with due to his dad doing what he did and us fighting when he was younger, him being colic, and then the cronic(chronic)constipation( he wont go #2 for a week to 2 wks) all in a very short time period. can agression be passed down geneticly? his father is very agressive and dificult as well, ive noticed even his family has issues like that.im truely lost, ive asked the doctor about what can be done and she is clueless. ive asked the school and they are pointless and push us aside( love the public school for that).i find myself crying almost every morning because of this, im scared im gonna have the next kid who is thrown in jail for his temper, or be thrown out of school.    im sorry if this is all jumbled, im still upset over hearing his teachers tell me he was hitting others again. i know there was something else i was wanting to say but with stress im a bit forgetful right now.
1062,i am very worried, my son is 19 months old and he is not talking. at home we speak two    languague. do you think this is    the problem maybe is better speak just in one language and later at the school, he will learn english.thank you

1064,hey everyone!    i was just wondering who else is in the homestretch of their pregnancies.    i'm 37 weeks today, and the dr told me at my appt she'd induce me a week early on the 16th, since i'm already 2 centimeters and 75% effaced.    i'm so glad i don't have to worry about being overdue!    what about everyone else, it should be interesting to see who has their baby early, late, etc.
1065,if you are taking the hcg drops, and are post menstrual, are you still able to getoverstimulation of the ovaries?
1066,\a long time ago, i started getting a white, or yellowish discharge that smelled like vinegar and tasted bitter. they gave me antibiotics for bv, without even testing me. then i got a very severe urinary tract infection. i was given strong antibiotics, again. all went back to normal and all was well. then i got what they thought was a yeast infection, they tested me for stds and did a pap. everything came back normal and i didn't even have a yeast infection to begin with. i got several yeast infections (about 4 or 5) in the past 4 months. now i don't know what's going on. my vagina feels raw, doesn't itch or burn, but still i get this thick, creamy, whitish, yellow discharge, that smells like vinegar and tastes bitter. i can no longer stay wet during sex, and sometimes cant even get wet. i can no longer orgasm, it hurts to have sex. whatever this is, it is taking over my life. i'm embarrassed, and ashamed to let him even touch me. i desperately need someone to tell me what is going on with my body so that i can get my life back.i am on birth control, but i never had these symptoms before, and i never had a reaction to condoms.
1067,my son taj is 2 yrs 3 months old. was born at 31 weeks with no health problems to date.there are a few things that have recently come to my attention and i am not sure if it is normal at all.he is having a problem eating. now this is not just picky. this is he will and can go 3 days without letting anything but liquid pass his lips on a good day he may eat 4-5 strawberries and a few dry crackers.this in turn has his height on above the 75 pertentile and his weight just above the 3rd. he due to this is extremely constipated. he can take 8 hours on his back to allow a poo to pass . he will go 2 to 3 times a month and is in extreme pain when passing. i can not however get more fibre into his diet as he will not allowhe is extemely clumsy. will fall into walls, fall over his own feet 5-8 times a day without tripping on anything.he has also started to, when palying with anything, line them up. wether it be cars, shoes, magnets on the fridge this is the way he plays. if the lines are not perfect he gets extremly upset and will not leave the activity until it is to his satisfaction.he is also living on a poss 7 -9 hrs sleep a night.is this normal ? i have a 5 yr old who i never had any of these traits with.     thank you.
1068,i;m 35 and i tried ivf but the dr said i have thick uterine wall and gave me pills to take but he never told me why. every time i read up on it the women say they don't get periods every month for 2 to 3 month but why do i have thick uterine walls when i get my period every month on time? with out any problems?
1069,my son is 4 years old and recently i had him tested for adhd. the doctor said that he observed no adhd tendencies but that he is extremely intelligent for his age. he added that my son is processing at the level of a 6-8 yr old verbally and 4-6 yr old non verbally.the problem we are having is that our son has these terrible tantrums when he does not get his way. he usually hits himself in the head when he is mad and has been known to throw things. he screams when his shows are turned off or he is made to eat. (it is impossible to get him to eat)otherwise, he is a loving little boy and very sweet most of the time. he is just extremely defiant and is constantly challenging myself and my husband.any ideas?
1070,can the length of a masturbation session cause scrotal harm or sperm problems?i know it is not normal but i have formed a habit over the last 15 years. i masturbate for very long periods of time( 4 to 12 hrs at a time). no this is no joke or bragging it is a problem. what happens is i start to fantasize or look at porn and the time just melts away. plus i enjoy the climax but i receive more pleasure from holding back.my wife and i have been trying to start a family. i have had sperm analysis done many times over the past couple years . they say my count is low but my volume is very high. so when they put them in the centrafuse(sp?) to get rid of the extra fluid i am normal. the shape is normal. the biggest concern is progression. it all but one time comes back slow forward progression.can prolonged masturbation sessions cause this. i usually don't masturbate 12 days or so before each semen analysis.please help!

1075,hello,i am 29 years old, have not had children and have had on and off issues with my labia feeling as though it is on fire, the skin itself is so sensitive to touch even the softest cotton underwear against my skin seems to get inflamed even more so.    when i have gone to doctors for this they run test after test for yeast, bacteria, uti, etc., and everything always comes back 'normal'.    sometimes i've been put on an antibiotic or sometimes not.    no one has ever been able to tell me what the problem is.    i don't drink soda, i don't use any perfumed anything to wash with, i have tried not shaving or shaving, i wear cotton underwear, do not wear tight clothes, make sure to dry off entirely before dressing, wash regularly after sex or other physical activity.    i eat yogurt regularly and have also started taking probiotics (which i understand takes a while to start working).i do not have odors or discharge or itching with this - everything i have studied focuses more on other symptoms such as these.is there anyone else who has had similar symptoms?    i have been tested and all is negative.    this has flared up whether or not i'm sexually active.    help!    any insight is much appreciated!thanks!
1076,my daughter is 16 months old and problably for the last 8 months rubs herself on the floor.    she even grunts while she is doing this.    i asked the doctor and she said not to worry about it to try and distract her while she is doing it.    i have tried that and as soon as i get her up and doing something else she gets back down and starts over.    it also seems that she is doing it more. does anyone have any suggestions??    should i contact her doctor again.    please help.this discussion is related tomasterbation(masturbation).

1087,my boyfriend and i engage in unprotected sex quite frequently. when we finish, and i go to clean up i feel cut at the back of my vagina, or my perineum-area; it is also pretty apparent that i'm cut when i notice a little blood when i clean up. any idea what this could mean? it's been happening to me for a while, and it's making sex less enjoyable and more of a pain, not to mention the cut isn't very flattering. any help on this would really be appreciated!
1088,i have noticed that recently black spots have develeped on the whites of my eyes.    they seem to be at the the ends of blood vessels which appear redder than other vessels in my eyes.    also, i've noticed that there are patches on the whites of my eyes which appear dark, not yellow, not brown, they just look dirty - maybe    a light beige.i can only see this when i hold up my eye lid and look down.    the black specks have only appeared in the last few weeks, but the dark patches have been gradually getting bigger over a period of two years.    can you please advise if this is anything to be concerned about?

1090,is it possible a thyroid women become a pragnent. need a complete information its medicin everything (a to z) thanks
1091,first of all let me describe my situation b/c i know people will immediately judge me.    i just need some ideas as to what is actually going on with my body.    i am in my mid 20's and a few months ago ended a long term relationship with someone.    i    was dating a man and having intercourse with him with a condom every single time, the whole time.    the dating and talking lasted a couple of months until i got reacquainted with a guy friend of 6 years.    we hung out, and had that instant attraction and knew we wanted to be together (monogamously).    the first night we hung out and the second night we became exclusive (both non-married and single).    our relationship has been wonderful ever since.    but, im worried, more than worried now. before my current boyfriend and i got together, i    possibly (not sure about the dates and period in august) had started to, one night, have intercourse with my exboyfriend, 1 time, no condom, but he has vasectomy, never finished b/c i didn't want to proceed.    i know for sure i had intercourse 2 times with the person i was dating non-exclusively but with a condom the entire time both times 5 days before i happened to wind up being with my wonderful boyfriend i have now.    my new boyfriend and i used a condom but had a mishap that resulted in it slipping off inside of me.    12 days after the condom mishap with my boyfriend, i went to the doctor for a urine pregnancy test, and a blood test which all came back negative.    now im close to 2 wks late for my period, which is not normal for me.    my boyfriend and i have been together for 24 days now, of course monogamously, and i am worried that i might be pregnant.    since then i have taken 2 home tests as well that came back negative.    i remember i had a period the july 18th, and i can't remember when mine was in august, but when would i normally get a period in september?    i have no breast tenderness, im tired b/c of my schedule, im not nauseous, no abnormal headaches, i am bloated and gassy, but i think that's my diet.    i know most of u think badly of me by now.    . :-(    surely if i were pregnant my new boyfriend would be the father??    i just don't know how i could tell the man that i have been such great friends with for so many years and that i have fallen for all of this.    after last period it was 1 time with ex with vasectomy, 2 times complete condom usage with person i was dating, and my new boyfriend and i haven't used a condom every time (pull out and finish with condom).    1 doc urine test, 2 hpt's, and 1 blood test later, all negative.    any ideas????btw, when all this is said and done, im getting an iud.    i worry sooo much....
1092,i'm 17. i am 2 days late for my period. i had sex once but used a condom but it didn't break. my bf says it was dry too. i have cramps and all my normal signs of my period. i've lost a couple pounds in the last week. my schedule has changed a lot. and i've been really stressed. do you think i'm pregnant?

1095,my boyfriend is coming into town and we want to consimate our relationship, but that just so happens to be when i am about due for my period. with the time frame i can't get into the gyno's office to get birth control before he gets here, are there any other methods i could use to delay my period or am i going to have to postpone our first time together??
1096,i also posted this in women's health but would love as much input as possible.    thank you.i had the mirena iud inserted about 2 months post-partum.    since then i have had a couple of side effects that i think may be from the iud and wanted to know if anyone else has had any of these (or others).the biggest problem is joint pain, primarily in my legs...although my back is pretty tight, but i suspect mostly from carrying the baby.    i looked into reasons for joint pain and mirena iud came up and thinking back it started about a month or so after i had the iud put in.others, i lost most of my pregnancy weight (except about 5-10 pounds) in the first 2 months p-partum but have now gained about 12 additional pounds (back to my 9-month pregnant weight). i am extremely fatigued, more than i should be even with a new baby, and low, low, low sex drive.anyone else have these or other symptoms?    and, can anyone recommend another bc option -- i really don't want to go back on the pill and don't like condoms.    i'd love any input.thanks!
1097,i'm 23 years old.    about 5'7 and around 200lbs.    i started taking birth control pills when i was 19, same height, but 160lbs (this is my body in really good shape - i know the bmi would say differently - but that's just my body type).the first pill i went on was yazmin, and although my skin and weight did not change, nor did my libido, i was extremely emotional, i pretty well could not stop crying (i think i took this for about 6-8 months).then i believe i switched to one called micronor (i think?), and i only did that one for about a couple months because i basically wouldn't stop spotting, i gained some weight and my skin got worse.i'm now on yaz, and for the most part it hasn't been that bad.    i don't get too emotional, not more than i usually would, my skin is fine, except for a little bit of a breakout during my period, but i have gained 40 lbs since starting it (and i've had a really hard time trying to lose it - and i also have really bad cravings for food all the time), and i have almost no sex drive.i've been with my boyfriend for a while, so i wasn't sure if i was just losing my sex drive as i got older. but when i wasn't on any birth control, and with the first two kinds of birth control i used, i had a great sex drive.    i really don't have any impulse for sex at all it seems now, so i'm starting to think that my birth control might be the problem.is there a birth control pill you can suggest for me?    i don't want to have bad acne, since i had it when i was younger, and it's finally stopped.    i want to be able to get in shape (i feel like my body is giving out, and i'm only 23) and lose weight. i don't want to have any crazy mood swings, because i am already a more emotional person.    and i really want my sex drive back...too be honest i miss it because my boyfriend and i had a very healthy sex life before, now i just feel lazy.can you help?
1098,im coming up to 47 i have three children 30 25 21 my boyfriend is 35 and has no kids we have been trying for a year now with no luck can you help us?

1100,recently i had this white bump on my tongue, i do have oral hsv1, but that usually shows up as coldsores on my lips. this white bump was sore and hurt, and at first i thought it was a wart but it went away fairly quickly so i don't believe it was that. my boyfriend didn't think it was serious either so we continued kissing and he recently just got one of these bumps on his tongue. what could they be? the bump is smaller than the size of a pencil eraser.
1101,another great asparagus recipe.fresh asparagus2 tbsp. red wine vinegar1 tbsp. finely chopped shallot1/4 cup canola oil2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 tbs. chopped mixed herbs (tarragon, chervil, chives, parsley, basil, thyme)salt & ground pepperbring a large pot of water to a raging boil.    line up tips of asparagus and trimoff tough fibrous bases.    please asparagus in small batches into well salted boiling water.    cook until asparagus is bright green and still has some crunch (1 - 3 minutes).    never try to cook too many at one time as the water must come back to a boil quickly after the asparagus is added.immediately plunge into an ice bath to stop cooking (1 minute or else will become waterlogged and tasteless).    drain.combine red wine vinegar & shallots in a bowl.    whisk in oils & season with salt and pepper.    toss some vinaigrette onto the asparagus (can marinate for a while).    add herbs just before serving.note:    i keep these in the fridge and just keep munching.    addictive.    the marinade is also good on tough meats.
1102,okay, here's the deal! my period is usually anywhere from every 14-42 days and as of right now i haven't had one in 61 days! crazy.might i add that they usually last 5-7 days.last time i was intimate was early september, and since then i've had a period in october for four days then another one in november after 42 days but again only lasted four days. i haven't seen a period since and it's now mid-late january.i'm dizzy, nauseous, sore back, tender breasts, and my stomach is firmer. also this morning i woke up and saw that my tummy was beating or pulsating which was a first ever for me!! i could and be paranoid or 'broken' but i'm reaching out to see if anyone else had similar experiences at all. before i struggle to find money for a pregnancy test i'd like others opinion. i'm a student and rather broke right now, so no, i dont think i could gather 10$. let me know what you think before i ask my pals.

1105,i left my emotionally abusive, alcoholic, unemployed husband about two years ago. we are now divorced and i have primary care and control of my three wonderful boys. i've been working really hard to give them a good life and keep it all together. the boys are very active in sports and i do the majority of the running around with them. i'm employed full time with a great company and i've also recently started a part time side business to supplement my income because i don't receive consistant child support from my ex. i feel exhausted most of the time and i tend to feel overwhelmed alot. most of my friends and family tell me i'm amazing and they could never do what i do but i feel like i don't have a choice because my kids mean the world to me and i'm the sole provider.my doctor precribed my with effexor xr 75mg's to help control my bouts of depression and anxiety. since i've been on it i've gained about 20 pounds and i am now smoking full time. (i used to smoke only socially). i have contant cravings for food, cigarettes and sometimes alcohol. the other problem i'm having is that my menstrual periods have been very irregular. i'm bleeding in between cycles and having alot of cramping. i can't get in to see my doctor for a few more weeks, but i'm considering switching to wellbutrin (based on what i've read) to control the weight gain and cravings.i feel that i need to stay on medication for a while to handle my emotions, but now i'm worried about other health issues. i'm wondering if anyone else out there has experienced anything similar?
1106,hi gals,i'm trying to help myself self-diagnose whatever i have thats goin on... i'm 29 yrs old and i've been experiencing painful/tender breasts since oct '09. i've gone to the er thinking it was my heart from shortness of breath and incredible breast pain... all the tests came back normal... i've had numerous blood work done, but have continued to have breast pain/tenderness especially to the touch. i'm currently on ortho novum 1/35 and recently went to a ob/gyn to switch my birth control pill and i guess she is going to put me on loestrin fe 1.5/30. i'm hoping that this will help alleviate my symptoms... anyone experience the same sharp painful breasts? what were the doctors saying when you went in? the more tests i want done, the more the doctors keep telling me i'm fine and that i don't need to take anymore tests and that they won't help me anymore, its so frustrating...
1107,hi everyone.we just came from our first u/s for our ivf baby.    the little bean is growing just like he should be.we had two embroys transferred but we will be having a singelton.    i will get my levels this afternoon but dr said the u/s confirms everything so that is what matters now.    yipeebaby dust to everyone else .............
1108,i am having cataract surgery in my right eye which also has astigmatism of 1 diopter and pseudoexfoliation.    my doctor recommends    a toric lens implant    to correct the astigmatism.    he says the likelihood that i will not need    glasses for distance is 80-90% with atoric lens implant but only 50% with an lri.    i am concerned that future weakness of the zonules will cause a toric lens to rotate requiring more surgery.    how successful is an lri with this amount of astigmatism?    am i overly concerned about dislocation from the pseudoexfoliation?
1109,hi,my father started getting some blind spot athe center of right eye. it began to increase. we consulted an ophthalmologist. he told there is no treatment for this. my father has vision in the left eye though alittle unclear. he asked the doctor whether we can make that one eye vision strong enough so that reading and driving is possible. the doctor suggest there is no treatment for this. is this true? please suggest.
1110,they don't, of course. and, if we consume enough vitamin a, perhaps neither do we. the nih says, dietary intake studies suggest an association between diets rich in beta-carotene and vitamin a and a lower risk of many types of cancer. a higher intake of green and yellow vegetables or other food sources of beta carotene and/or vitamin a may decrease the risk of lung cancer. (9) a study of over 82,000 people showed that high intakes of vitamin a reduce the risk of stomach cancer by one-half. (10) dr. jennifer brett comments that vitamin a fights cancer by inhibiting the production of dna in cancerous cells. it slows down tumor growth in established cancers and may keep leukemia cells from dividing. (11) a derivative of the vitamin has been shown to kill cem-c7 human t lymphoblastoid leukemia cells and p1798-c7 murine t lymphoma cells. (12)vitamin a is very far from being a cancer promoter. rather, it is very near to the cancer solution.references:(1) vitamin a pushes breast cancer to form blood vessel cells. sciencedaily, july 17, 2008. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080715204719.htm(2) drug slows prostate tumor growth by keeping vitamin a active. november 6, 2007. findings from the aacr centennial conference on translational cancer medicine: from technology to treatment, singapore, november 4-8, 2007 http://www.aacr.org/home/public--media/news/news-archives-2007.aspx?d=922(3) vitamin a derivative could restore smokers' health. http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/news/ng.asp?id=26231-vitamin-a-derivative(4) http://www.lef.org/whatshot/2006_05.htm . see also: kim kn, pie je, park jh, park yh, kim hw, kim mk. retinoic acid and ascorbic acid act synergistically in inhibiting human breast cancer cell proliferation. j nutr biochem. 2006 jul;17(7):454-62. epub 2005 nov 15.(5) http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/ppi/unconventionaltherapies/vitaminaretinol.htm(6) http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitamina/(7) annual reports of the american association of poison control centers' national poisoning and exposure database (formerly known as the toxic exposure surveillance system). aapcc, 3201 new mexico avenue, ste. 330, washington, dc 20016. download any report from1983-2006 at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/npds/annualreports/tabid/125/default.aspx free of charge. the vitamin category is usually near the end of the report.(8) basu s, sengupta b, paladhi pk. single megadose vitamin a supplementation of indian mothers and morbidity in breastfed young infants. postgrad med j. 2003 jul;79(933):397-402. and: rahmathullah l, tielsch jm, thulasiraj rd et al. impact of supplementing newborn infants with vitamin a on early infant mortality: community based randomized trial in southern india. bmj. 2003 aug 2;327(7409):254.)(9) http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamina.asp(10) larsson sc, bergkvist l, n  slund i, ruteg  rd j, wolk a. vitamin a, retinol, and carotenoids and the risk of gastric cancer: a prospective cohort study. am j clin nutr. 2007 feb;85(2):497-503.(11) brett, n.d., jennifer. how vitamin a works. 20 december 2006. howstuffworks.com. http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/vitamin-a.htm .(12) chan ln, zhang s, shao j, waikel r, thompson ea, chan ts. n-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide induces apoptosis in t lymphoma and t lymphoblastoid leukemia cells. leuk lymphoma. 1997 apr;25(3-4):271-80.for further information: read full text, peer-reviewed nutritional research papers, free of charge: http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jomnutritional medicine is orthomolecular medicineorthomolecular medicine uses safe, effective nutritional therapy to fight illness. for more information: http://www.orthomolecular.orgthe peer-reviewed orthomolecular medicine news service is a non-profit and non-commercial informational resource.editorial review board:carolyn dean, m.d., n.d.damien downing, m.d.harold d. foster, ph.d.steve hickey, ph.d.abram hoffer, m.d., ph.d.james a. jackson, phdbo h. jonsson, md, ph.dthomas levy, m.d., j.d.erik paterson, m.d.gert e. shuitemaker, ph.d.andrew w. saul, ph.d., editor

1114,so my dh and i have been ttc for a few months now. we had a mc last november and really hope to be pregnant soon :) my last af was on april 26th so i am due in about a week. lately i have had symptoms of: sore breasts especially nipples (and i never get sore boobs, not even with my miss last year), been feeling a little nauseous at night and sometimes the morning, gotten dizzy a few times, tires all the time and almost can't get up in the morning!, and i've had sever acne over my back shoulders chest breasts and face and i hardly get acne. i was just diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was told that may have led to my miss last year. i recently started medication for that and also been given vitamin d and vitamin b because i am deficient in both. i can't help but get my hopes up because of my symptoms but i'm also worried that i'm just fooling myself. has anyone else experienced similar symptoms to find out they were indeed pregnant? and anyone else with hypothyroidism vitamin b and d deficiency find out you were pregnant? what were your symptoms??
1115,i have momentary loss of vision on my left eyes and consistent sharp intense pain for both eyes. when i went to c specialist, he say is due to dry eyes syndrome and the reason for the loss of vision is unknown. now my dried eyes is becoming better already, the pain of the eyes is now more severe, where it is no more intense sharp pain but long persistent pain, which up to hours. my right eye's pain occurs in the morning when i wake up but the left eye's usually occurs after the right eyes and the left eye very easy to feel tired, especially when it is about evening and night time. the left eye is watery compared to the right one and when press against it, it feel more soft compared to the right one. i feel my left eyes start to deviate from the normal condition that my eyes usually have. my left eye feels tired easily that sometimes i need to close it and use only my right eye. what happen to both my eyes?
1116,regulators are exploring whether organ transplant drugs made by roche and novartis increase the risk of an often-fatal neurological disease. the fda said it had identified 16 cases of patients developing the rare neurological ailment while taking roch's drug cellcept, which is used to avoid rejection in organ transplant patients. roche alerted regulators to the issue last november. the fda is looking into similar risks with myfortic. the article goes onto say it will take about 2 months to review the reports and approve new labeling for the medication. until then, regulators advise doctors and patients to watch for symptoms of neurological problems. the disease attacks the brain and central nervous system and is usually fatal. symptoms include vision problems, loss of coordination and memory loss. patients that survive are often permanently disabled. roche has confirmed 10 cases of the disease in cellcept patients. the drug has been used by an estimated 500,000 patients worldwide. problems have been reported in kidney, heart and lung transplant patients.
1117,a couple of weeks ago i developed this strong lightheadedness and had a really odd feeling in my body; i think it might have been anxiety.    my blood pressure also goes up during this time    (example:    145/93 - pulse:    89)    i have this off and on all day.    usually goes away at bedtime.my primary care doctor has taken blood tests and an ekg to rule out any other problems; so far the tests are normal. my doctor is not sure what the problem is.... doesn't sound like she knows how to advise me at this point.    the lightheadness is really a drain on me and makes it difficult to concentrate.i have been under stress for some time.... as i have been unemployed for well over a year.    my question is, can anxiety come on so suddenly..... i have had stressful situations before, but never experienced physical symptoms.    i am also a middle-age woman....at menopause. what can i do beside medicate myself to relief these symptoms so i can feel normal again? and if i have to take anti-anxiety meds.... what are the safest?
1118,please need some solution to this aweful taste after eating anything. stays in the upper tongue area for 15 to 30 minutes after ingesting anything. not so much with water.
1119,i have known about my impacted wisdom in my lower left side for some time now. it had not really bothered me but lately i have had horrible pain in my jaw and ear on that side. my teeth on that side of my mouth throb in general. it feels like tmj but i am not sure. i also have noticed that my spit gland located under my ear and in the area of where the jaw hinges is either swollen or has some sort of soft movable lump on it. i am getting headaches too. could all of this be caused by that impacted wisdom tooth?
1120,i went to the doctor's today and i asked the nurse what my hcg levels were.. she said they were 90 which either means i am very early or i am in the process of a miscarriage ( which i knew already).. you don't have to be a rocket scientiest to know what is going on.... i am just so mad and upset about this 2nd miscarriage.... so tommorrow i will find out if they rise or lower and if they rise it is a mircale, because this bleeding and cramps are way to out of control..... but thought i would update ya's thanks for your help guys i will let ya know about tommorrow to.... if ya's have nayhting to comment about please do so...:)
1121,i am looking for help with terminology as well as any comments about my condition.    i am a late 40's male that has always had glasses: astigmatism + myopia. three years ago i was treated for a conjuctival lymphoma with biopsy and radiation.    then, six months ago i was struck by a softball in the other eye, causing orbital fracture, among others (nose, zygo, maxillary).    traumatic mydriasis. diplopia since the accident.    disconjugate gaze. one reconstruction placed titanium plates for fractures, and titanium mesh for sinus cavity and for floor of orbit.    the inferior rectus muscle formed scar tissue (hematoma) and anchored into the mesh, and the orbital implant had slipped.    a revision surgery and forced duction test one month later restored 80% of motility by replacing the orbit floor mesh with medpor, but upgaze is affected because the muscle cannot relax enough. the orbital globe is maybe 2mm+ lower than before accident. there was not much left of the orbit floor to support the implant.now i am still seeing three doctors: cornea/disease, ped ophthalmologist and ophthalmic plastic surgeon.     recently tried    prism lenses with 14 degrees of correction (split 7 degrees up/down for each eye) and really had trouble reading with the 1.5 x bifocal.    i became nauseous from walking with them.    the damaged eye has a shadow (mydriasis +astigmatism?).    besides the general 20/40 corrected vision in the damaged eye (still taking pred forte and combigan) because of perhaps a cataract and remaining iritis,    i cannot seem to fuse the two images easily.    every time i blink things go back to double for a second or two.    when i move my head to look at something, i have to re-focus and get the images to fuse again.     things are fine if i am sitting and watching tv but i really don't do that much since my team exited the ncaa tourney.my strabismus doctor says that surgery cannot fix the problems and delay in fusing images. he said that 14 degrees correction is treatable with corrective lenses, but if it were say 3x that much he would recommend surgery.is there any experience in this area, will this problem in fusing images get better?    i cannot imagine trying to drive like that, seeing two roads for a time. not to mention photophobia from the mydriasis.     is there a term for this delay in fusing two images?is the vertigo/nausea/general problems using the prism lenses something that can be gotten used to, or perhaps there is really something wrong with the lenses -- i admit it must be hard to fill this rx with all the things going on.grasping for info, or even looking for what questions to ask my doctor at the next visits, in 2 months.should i just keep wearing the eye patch and call it -- good as it gets?    of course a doctor doesn't want to discourage a patient, and every case is different.     surely someone has had a similar injury.thanks for any help or comments.george
1122,for about 2 months now i have been experience this strange/ uncomfortable pulling sensation above my heart.    nothing seems to trigger this sensation or make it subside.    my doctor ordered a holter monitor/ which did not show any arrythmias.    the doctor therefore blew it off and does not believe that anything else could be causing this.    does anyone have any idea what this could be?this discussion is related tonon cardiac chest wall pain.

1127,hi all,little new to all this, so bear with me!i would just to like a little bit of light shed on a few things...in the past my cycle has been pretty much like clock work (29 days) but so far this month my period has not turned up (4 days late).i know a few people have mentioned that they feel like their period is coming leading up to their due date however, i have not felt the same. i have had a little discomfort but not the normal cramps (i usually take naprogesics the day before my period comes).the only other symptoms are that relate to pregnancy are needing to go to the toilet regularly (about 6 times in the last 3 hours!), nausea and swollen (not sore) breasts.around 5-7 days after the middle of my cycle i had cramps that were particularly painful (i thought at the time it was a late ovulation - not sure if this sounds like implantation cramps.my husband and i are not actively trying to conceive however, many times this month we have only used withdrawal as contraception (other times we have used condoms - i chose not to go on the pill).any thoughts and personal experiences would be appreciated :)
1128,...canadian man misses super bowl trip after 1981 pot bust denies him entry to u.s.myles wilkinson won a fantasy football contest to attend super bowl xlvii, but his dreams of going to the big game went up in smoke because of a 1981 pot bust.according to a story by the cbc, the 50-year canadian man was denied entry to the united states this week because of a conviction for possession of two grams of marijuana over 30 years ago.wilkinson, a seattle seahawks fan from vancouver island, beat out almost four million other players to win the trip to see the san francisco 49ers play the baltimore ravens. but when he got to the airport on thursday, u.s. customs agents brought up an arrest the man had when he was 19. they denied him entry to the country and ended any chance of making it down to new orleans for a memorable weekendhttp://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/canadian-man-wins-contest-attend-super-bowl-not-210921980--nfl.htmlthat just ain't right!
1129,my daughter is going to be 6 in november.    she is in her third week of kindergarten and i can see many changes in her behavior already.    i expected changes, but not this kind.    my daughter has been talking alot about butts, boobies and tookies (vagina).    she has just started to draw pictures of tinker bell with boobs.    she says that her doll has boobs so she is drawing them.    the other day my daughter was playing simon says with her dad and i heard her say simon says touch your tookie.    totally caught my husband by surprise and i tried to explain to her why that was not approriate to say, but i'm not sure she is hearing me.    she came home from school one day telling me that boys like worms, underwear and butts.    the bus driver informed me that she kissed a boy on the bus.    when i asked her about it, she told me that he kept asking her to kiss him and she kept saying no and then he said please so she kissed him on the chin.    he asked her to kiss him on the lips so when he said please again, she did.my daughter was with my inlaws today and she told them that her baby brother bite her on the tookie.    my son has never bitten, so i'm wondering if she is just a story teller.    my father in law said she was talking a    lot about butts.i need to know is this normal behavior?    i'm starting to worry that she should be seeing a professional.    should i say something to her teacher?    will they blame me for her odd behavior?    i am afraid of what could come from her mouth next.thank you in advance!

1135,i have a 7 yr old son. he is extremely bright for his age and thinks and acts more mature than what he should at 7. in the last 3 years we have been dealing with a lot of anger issues with him. it doesn't take much to set him off. he have tried every way of discipline, from spankings (not hard or anything, just a tap on the rear) to sitting him down and calmly talking with him about the way that he feels. he doesn't respond to anything. he will get so angry that it brings him to lie about everything and he will raise his fist at us and kick at us. when we ask him to tell us what he is feeling and why he is so mad, he makes things up that doesn't make sense at all. we don't know what to do anymore. we are both at wits end and neither of us know how to handle him anymore. lately, we have been discipling him by sending him to a time-out in his bed for about 20 minutes (depending on the extremity of the issue) and he will sit in his room and kick and punch the walls and scream at the top of his lungs. he isn't like this everyday but we have to fuss at him everyday for his behavior. he has punched his 2 yr old brother in the stomach before but is normally very nice to him and helps him out in any way. my son has gone back to my mother and told her horrible stories about my husband and i and i am very afraid that he will get taken away from us. what should we do and how should we handle this type of situation?

1138,http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/03/14207942-policy-differences-take-center-stage-in-first-presidential-debate?litepolicy largely trumped   zingers   in the first debate between president barack obama and republican presidential nominee mitt romney as the two sparred on issues as varied as taxes and spending, entitlements, education and more.romney sought to cast himself as a capable and affable alternative to the sitting president and looked to establish himself as presidential in a major opportunity to reach voters in a side-by-side setting at the university of denver. hitting that mark was especially important for republican presidential nominee, given the high expectations he had faced entering tonight  s forum, having trailed obama in most polls before this event.president barack obama shakes hands with republican presidential nominee mitt romney after the first presidential debate at the university of denver, wednesday, oct. 3, 2012, in denver.obama, for his part, cast his republican opponent as elusive in specifying just how he would cut taxes without adding to the national debt, or what form his own health care reforms would take.but neither candidate seemed to achieve any breakout moment, and two additional debates throughout october could prove more pivotal to the election  s outcome.taxes and spending dominated the outset of the debate, as obama and romney battled largely over the details of romney  s tax proposals, which call for an across-the-board, 20 percent reduction in each marginal tax rate. the republican argues the cost of these would be offset by reducing deductions.my number one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit, romney said.romney asserted his tax plan would spur job creation and help balance the budget, but the president insisted that these proposals simply do not add up.in the final push in the 2012 presidential election, candidates mitt romney and barack obama make their last appeals to voters.the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class, obama said. it's math. it's arithmetic.with a few exceptions, both candidates largely avoided the snappy, practiced lines that sometimes come to define debates. their discussion at many times overrode the objections of moderator jim lehrer, and some of the topics for debate had to be shortened or cut altogether to accommodate for the candidates   long-windedness.in a time-honored debate tradition, both campaigns   surrogates declared victory for their candidate of choice. but style for both obama and romney seemed as important of a factor as any specific answer.romney entered the debate needing to make up ground versus obama, and the matchup this evening offered voters their first chance to make a direct comparison between the two of them. the republican nominee also sought to soften his tone in many respects, a bow toward the net-negative personal approval rating he suffers in many polls.obama campaign manager jim messina told reporters following the debate that the president  s long-windedness was   never going to be our strong suit,   and acknowledged that romney had scored   style points.    this is a race to 270 electoral votes,   messina said.   in states like ohio and virginia and florida, romney  s positions on tax cuts and medicare are going to be real problems for him. and he doubled down on those all night.  but obama didn  t score a knockout punch against romney, declining to employ the controversial video about the   47 percent   of americans whose votes the gop nominee had essentially dismissed. obama declined to talk about romney  s record at bain capital or the personal income tax rate paid by romney    two major, effective lines of attack used by the democratic campaign over the summer.nbc's david gregory, savannah guthrie and chuck todd provide analysis immediately following the first 2012 presidential debate between gop nominee mitt romney and president barack obama.romney also parried many of the president  s attacks by largely embracing the essence of many of obama  s own policies    from health care to education and regulation    while emphasizing the areas in which the two of them differed.romney said he supports repealing the dodd-frank financial regulatory reform law, but replacing it with an alternative of his own. he has said that about immigration, and defused a briar patch involving his and obama  s similar health care plans by seizing upon process.  i like the way we did it in massachusetts. i like the fact that in my state, we had republicans and democrats come together and work together,   said romney.   what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single republican vote.  toward the end of the debate, obama struck back by questioning whether romney  s own promises were too good to be true.  at some point, i think the american people have to ask themselves, is the reason that gov. romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?   obama asked.the immediate fallout of the debate will be most quickly reflected in media cycles on thursday and into the weekend, though it might take days   worth of polling to identify whether tonight  s debate moved the needle.obama and romney will next meet oct. 16 for the second of three debates. before then, vice president joe biden and republican vice presidential nominee paul ryan will debate next thursday in kentucky.
1139,ladies, i am 3-4 dpo and have been having cramps on my right side where my ovary is and weird dull aches (tingles) across my stomach. i know your not really pregnant until implantation but could this be a good sign? please give me your opinions.
1140,my son is just about to turn seven years old and he continues to fall further and further behind growth wise. he was born six weeks premature and of course small. he is only 44 inches tall which places him in the lowest percentile on the charts, and always the smallest among classmates & teamates. his mom is only 5'-1 or so and i am about 6'1. her family tended to be small, and mine about where i am.i realize in the grand scheme of things it's not a huge issue. but of course as a dad i worry about him getting picked on, being able to compete in sports (he's a great athlete), and how society and the opposite sex sometimes view shorter men (when he grows up).is there anything that can be done to spur his growth a bit?
1141,hi. my problem is that i dont have much sensation in my vaginal area. this is because i injured the area a whiled back, recently ive been feeling more sentation than before. but its an itching sensation to the nerves and it keeps me awake. how can i get full stimulation back, how do i ease my nerves ?    please help.

1143,my situation:1. 16 years old2. had sex about 4 weeks ago (with a condom, but my boyfriend didn't really know what he was doing)3. my period is 2 days late4. i also have sour nipples (no odd color, however ) , period    cramps, and diarrhea (but the diarrhea    could be from what i've been eating    lately )5. i have virtually no discharge (it's usually bad, but for the past 2 days, my underwear has been totally clean.could i be pregnant?now before you star typing    your incredibly long lectures about the dangers and consequences of having sex at my age, i'd like to inform you that i'm already very aware. i know i shouldn't have, but my boyfriend. he has this way with words that made me disregard everything i've learned in the past. when i told him i might be pregnant he told me that that's not his problem, and so... i kicked him down my stairs (he's doing fine. in the hospital). i've read up on pregnancy when i was 13 and i know most of the facts. but this situation is a little different and i would like to know if i may be pregnant. i won't be easy letting my mother know, but it's a consequence that i have to face for my actions. please. your answers are greatly respected and appreciated.

1147,i feel like i am not ready to have this baby.    i just feel like i want her to stay in there a while longer and my doc is talking about inducing friday!    i have a three year old and i am just scared to death about what is going to happen when i bring another baby home.    this pregnancy was totally planned and i never wanted anything more than a ds and dd.    that is what i am getting, but i just feel like i am not ready.    i have worried this whole pregnancy that there is something wrong because i got a false positive on my afp test.    it all worked out fine, but still worry deep down.    i think i am anxious to meet my dd because of this deep down fear.    i feel like god already blessed me with a wonderful, smart and healthy son and i am worried that this one will not be as healthy.    is this just a normal part of having another baby?    i was so ready to have my ds and could not wait to meet him.    i feel so bad because i want to be more excited.    i know that when she comes out and i see her, i will feel differently but i just can't get myself emotionally prepared.    anyone who has felt the same please respond so i will know i am not alone.    i know she can't stay in forever!!

1155,i just recieved this in the mail, but i would like to know if it is safe and does it really work.    i also would like to know if it will make my heart go faster like some of the other diet pills do.
1156,i mixed up my birth control and needed some advise.    i was taking micronore while nursing my baby.    i continued to take it after i stopped nursing and then stopped taking it as soon as i started my period.    its five days later and i have not started my new method - the patch.    any advise what i can do if i can't use latex.
1157,my husband and i recently received his kids in october 2010 from their mother (who didn't want them anymore). since we have had them, we have noticed weird behavior from them.just the other day, i was looking in my digial camera and noticed alot of pictures of them taking pictures of each others butts, and penis. it disturbs me because i have 2 kids myself (7 yr daughter & 6 yr son). the youngest (3 yr old) tried to touch my daughter on the butt(she had pants on) while she laying down on the sofa watching a movie. all i can do is put him in timeout..we talked to them when the camera thingy was discovered.i don't know what happen while ith their mother and her boyfriend, but that's only the beginning... the small one seems to have more angry problem about something, his even played in his own fecus (2 times already), his pooped in my shower while i gave him a shower. his hit me twice, as if he was an adult, his even fights and hit his father.my point of view, i think he has saw something at his mother's house...we have ask her and she states no way, but recently i found her profile on facebook where she is posing naked pictures of herself.we do not in anyway show anything we should not in front of the kids. can anybody give us some advice? should i take him back to his doctor and have him checked for sexual abuse? is it to late to tell? i called to schedule appointment with psysc...but due to weather(snowed in) we could not go, now i'm having to reschedule. your advice would be nice of you...because i don't wont my kids to be put in this mess much. and i have told all of the kids, if someone touches you, come tell us!
1158,after 3 kids (one was 4.5 kilo) my belly is...not perfect. thus, if i lay down on the back i could easily move 40 times my body up, could go to 100 if necessary. thus, the belly is still here. does it mean i have good muscles or not? should i do other belly exercises or should i do more? i feel there is some fat to lose, but not so much and when i relax belly muscles and if underwear is low - belly goes down over it. that is not nice, i can not wear bikini.anyone knows about such things? what should i do?
1159,hi there...if you have had or know of any symptoms of a blighted ovum, please share them with me if you are able. i am 6 weeks pregnant, had some small amounts of brown spotting last week, and at the ultrasound yesterday the fetus was not seen and sacs were clear but small. any thoughts would be appreciated. not sure what to think. thanks.
1160,does anyone have a recommendation for a west houston gynecologist?    i have recently moved to the area. i was diagnosed with endometriosis    six years ago and experience many symptoms of the strange condition. i currently have a dr. that dismisses all of my reported pain and abnormal bleeding (including heavy bleeding, clots and absences of a menstrual cycle at all). can anyone recommend a doctor that practices quality patient care? or someone that has a genuine care for patients? thank you so much!
1161,for some reason the bottom of my tongue has been bothering me.    it is the little line thing that connects your tongue and your mouth. i have noticed a little redness but very little.    i don't think i bit it because it is in a hard to bite area.    it is not too serious it' just annoying. thanks:)
1162,today my stomach started hurting and mild had little brown discharge. if this is my period it is early.my cycle is normally 21 days and this would make
1163,i took an hpt on the 6 day before my missed period and it came up negative. why is this. i know my husband and i had sex on the day that my ovulation started and i was wondering..is it possible that i could be pregger? also i am having some very mild faint cramping today which is the 5th day before my missed period.
1164,can anyone help, a couple of hours after i eat a meal i get heartburn and start feeling sick, the longer i wait for something to eat the more sick i feel.    once i have eaten then i feel ok again for a couple of hours, this has been going on now for a few weeks, i dont normally suffer from heartburn.
1165,well i got my period when i was about to turn 15. i am now going to be 19 and my period is still not normal. i would skip months at a time. i have taken pregnancy tests; all negative. i have no idea what's going on with my body. should i be worried? and a couple of days ago me and my partner had really rough sex and i started bleeding after. not really alot; it just looked like i was spotting. but i have no idea what is going on. should i go see my doctor?
1166,a dear sweet girl in the pg forum (who was due the same day i was) sent me the following words after hearing about my m/c.    i think it's very special and wanted to share it with you beautiful ladies.an angel in the book of life wrote down my baby's birth. then whispered as she closed the book too beautiful for earth. (author unknown)
1167,in april during a 5 hour car trip my feet became very itchy- it itched them and they became red and swollen in areas. the whole foot was not swollen: but certain parts became itchy and red- under toes, sides of feet, a little on top- no ankle swelling or redness.    these itchy red areas become hard and painful to walk, the outbreaks last about 24-48 hours.    the first time this happened i passed it off to wearing new and cheap high heals for over 13 hours the day before (i teach).    that day i also had some trouble with a family member who was staying with me- so i felt stress may have been a contributor?however, about 3 weeks later this happened again   and i went off to the doctor  s.    the swelling doesn  t occur in the same area each   outbreak  - however the onset is always the same, itchy, red, turns hard, becomes painful.    my family doctor looked at my like i was crazy for being concerned; i am a healthy 24 year old.    however, this has happened since april 4 more times.    it has happened right (one-two days) before menstrual cycle in may, june and now july- i am not pregnant.i have seen a podiatrist- who took xrays and did blood work (i know the blood work was for lupus and arthritic counts but not sure the scope of the tests).    he concluded my foot is mis-shaped and molded orthotics for me.    however, this has happened two more times- i am trying to understand what is triggering this as nothing relieves the swelling, itchiness or pain.as i have tracked these episodes they don  t seem to happen with any certainty- meaning i have tracked my physical activity (i workout a lot), bought and wear 4x width cross trainer shoes- even to work, and the only pattern that exists with these outbreaks is many of them are occurring right before i begin my period.    could this be a part of pms? they checked my blood pressure at the doctors all times i have been there- the only other thing i can think of is a circulation problem- sometimes the pain travels up to my calves (feels very sore like the day after a hard workout).    but at this point i feel like i am guessing with no guidance?
1168,i know i posted about cramping while pregnant a little while ago but they have been hurting! almost close to the cramps i had during my mc. there is no blood but just cramps that are hellacious! is it normal? i am only like 3 weeks now maybe 4. has any one else had this?
1169,.....there was a gain of 290,000 jobs in the month, up from a revised 230,000 jobs added in march. it was the largest number of jobs added to the labor force since march 2006. addressing a sidebar/mood which states: unemployment at 9.9%...the report also includes a separate survey of households that it uses to estimate the unemployment rate, which increased to 9.9%. economists had forecast the rate would hold steady at 9.7%.the rise in the unemployment rate is actually a sign of improving perception of labor market conditions. the increase was due to an uptick in job seekers who had previously been discouraged and dropped out of the job market. there was a jump of 805,000 workers returning to the labor force in april alone.when you think about the force it takes to get 800,000 beaten-down people off the couch and back on the street looking for work, that's pretty significant, said lakshman achuthan, managing director of economic cycle research institute....broad-based gains: the job picture got a lift from the addition of 66,000 jobs by the u.s. census bureau, which is in the process of completing the once-in-a-decade headcount of the u.s. population.but the gains went far beyond that one-time census boost, as private sector employers added 231,000 jobs. and the gains were broad based, as nearly two-thirds of industries across the private sector added jobs rather than cutting staff.republican critics of the administration focused on the unemployment rate rather than gain in payrolls.positive job growth is always welcome news, but this rising and painfully high unemployment rate is a far cry from president obama's promise that the trillion-dollar 'stimulus' would keep joblessness from rising above 8%, said house minority leader john boehner in a statement.i don't think this is the high water mark, said jack kleinhenz, economics professor, case western reserve university. but even with stronger gains ahead, we have a long way to go.achuthan said the upswing in both the overall economy and the labor market is particularly important for helping withstand external shocks, such as worries about the greek government possibly defaulting on debt or large drops in the stock market, as were seen thursday.the jobs report underscores this is a resilience of the recovery, he said. when the business cycle is in an upswing, it starts to feed on itself, and the economy can withstand a pretty big shock without being tipped into a new downturn.u.s. stocks started the day higher following the pre-market jobs report, but within the first hour of trading, fell into negative territory once again.http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/07/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm?cnn=yes&hpt=t3mike
1170,hi,i recently had ivf done after a ruptured ectpic which had damaged my right tube. the md felt that it was going to be a success, given that my eggs/embryos looked good. they transferred 2 embryos, one of which had turned into a blastocyst. my hcg levels thereafter were steadily rising, except that when i went in for my 5wks6d ultrasound, the md could not find a yolk sac and my hcg numbers came back extremely low - 656 (when the prior hcg that was done 9 days before that was at 391). md is suspecting either another ectopic or miscarriage. i'm extremely worried and frustrated at the same time - dh and i have been trying to conceive for 2 years now! has anyone had any of these symptoms and go on to have a viable pregnancy?
1171,hi everyone!!after having three failed iuis, two failed ivfs, and one ivf resulting in a miscarriage i really felt i had nothing to lose in my endeavours to get pregnant and complete my family with a much wanted third child.here is a list of what i added to my ivf (icsi) cycle last september/october.    i am now going on 17 weeks pregnant, and pray eveything turns out fine finally.    i am not necessarily recommending any of these things, as it is important for every individual to research on their own and decide what they are willing to add to their cycle, but, i want to list them here so others can choose to look into them if they wish.of all the medicines, supplements and procedures i added, melatonin, myo-inositol, vitamin e,    vitamin d3, saizen, intralipid, and the hysteroscopy were the ones which were added for the first time to this last successful cycle and one of them could be the answer to my ongoing bfp!there is a lot being written up about melatonin in conjunction with vitamin e.    also a lot of research and positive findings regarding myo-inositol.    the other supplements all seem to have properties thought to improve egg/embryo quality.    dhea is quite a big one being used by many women, and some fertility clinics prescribe it to older women.    the pycnogenol and trans-resveratrol are supplements that i notice quite a few doctors actually recommend.    as with most remedies, you will find positive research and then you'll find negative research, so before you start taking any of these, please look into them yourself, as i'd hate to recommend anything you think has an adverse effect.    i also started weekly acupuncture with a fertility expert about three months prior to my cycle.    i continued it throughout the cycle and also 13 weeks into my pregnancy.the other thing i did was ask my re to perform a hysteroscopy prior to my last successful ivf cycle.    this is a quick procedure where a camera is inserted so your uterus can be seen.    i knew there was nothing wrong with my uterus, but the reason for me having it done was so that my re could scrap away a piece of the endometrium so that a scar formed.    there have been statistics showing that the procedure can increase pregnancy rates, as the scarred endometrium makes implantation more successful.it also pays to have your thyroid checked, and also have a panel of immune tests taken.i also asked my re to prescribe saizen last cycle which i started taking on the day i started stimulation drugs for ivf.    (i used the micro-dose flare protocol, with 225iu of puregon, plus 2 x daily shots of buserelin).    saizen is a human growth hormone, and is often used for older women or women with egg quality issues.    also, this last cycle, i was prescribed with prednisone.    i started on this a day after egg collection, and kept taking it up to 7 weeks gestation.all this time, i've kept off caffeine and i think it's best to keep off alcohol.    i don't drink alcohol, and think maybe it's not great for fertility, although there's nothing documented about it.    i just feel a healthy lifestyle can only be good for our fertility.the other big thing i tried this successful cycle was intralipid.     i was worried about the possibility of my having having acquired an auto-immune problem, as my ana was high when it was tested in 2008.    intralipid was given to me the day i started stimulation drugs.    it was also administered    the week i received my bfp, and then at 5 - 6 week intervals after that.    now i'm almost 17 weeks, i won't be having anymore intralipid as my re thinks the risk of a reaction may outweigh the benefits at this stage.here are the supplements i used for my last cycle:-fish oil - omega 3, with epa and dhamyo-inositol (must be myo-inositol, not just inositol)melatonin (3mg)vitamin e (600mg)vitamin d3 (1,000 iu)wheatgrass in powder formroyal jelly, liquid form best, but capsules still okbee propolisl'argininecq10 (800mg)dhea (75mg - 3 x 25mg daily)dimpycnogenoltrans-resveratrol (some re's actually recommend this in conjunction with pycnogenol)green tea (one cup per day - decaffinated)macalow dose aspirini used vitex for my third cycle from memory, but cut it out before doing my last cycle after reading some not so good reports on it.now, i'm not necessarily saying any of these things contributed to my now being pregnant, but after 2 1/2 years of heartache,    in my heart, i do feel that something did help me this time.    maybe the intralipid, maybe the hysteroscopy, or even the saizen or myo-inositol?    who knows?please don't start taking these things without looking into them yourself.    all i want to do is to list them, and let people know that after using them, i did get pregnant.the one last important thing is to have a fertility specialist who realistically believes in you.    my first re unreasonably gave up on me after my first ivf failure.    he thought i should be happy with two children, and after my miscarriage last may, went on to say the only way i'd achieve another pregnancy was if i used a young egg donor.    i wasn't willing to do this, as i had two young children and wasn't ready to give up on my own eggs.    i changed to another re at the same clinic who believed another pregnancy was indeed possible and that donated eggs should be plan 'd'.    his confidence in my ability to have another genetic child gave me extra confidence.    and this is very, very important in this game.good luck everyone!!!!    patience, perserverance and a fair amount of money (if you're like me and had to pay out of pocket) are often the key to getting pregnant with your own eggs!!!    especially once you're over 35!xox
1172,me and my girl decided to 'play' around last night, the 23rd of january. so we were kissing, then feeling and a couple hours later we were having sex, with a condom of course. well we were actually having sex for maybe 10 minutes and she says oh wait, i don't want a urinary tract infection, let me go pee and she left the room for maybe 2 minutes max. well i didn't think about it then but i know if you lose the 'boner' in a condom somehow the condom can become ineffective. i couldn't get it hard enough to stay in her because she was real tight and along with the peeing incident, my cat jumped on the bed and someone called both our phones. so we decided to just end it and i took the condom off. we made out and she gave me a ********. then i fingered her. now i'm wondering if it is realistically possible that i got enough pre-*** on my fingers while taking the condom off (i didn't ejaculate in it) to get her pregnant while fingering her? her period ended 3 or 4 days before we had sex, i know for a fact the condom didn't break, she is going to take plan b tomorrow, less than 48 hours after the incident, and again there was just pre-*** in the condom. should we be in the clear? this is gonna be a long three weeks... help!?!?!?
1173,hello!    i am new to this site but have read a lot of your posts.    i had a mc 9/28/08 (my first pregnancy) went to the dr and them told me it was a chemical pregnancy.    so, i have been waiting for my cycle to come again and its hasn't.    its been about 30 days since my mc.    so, i took a home test and it was positive and really dark, my first test wasn't even that dark.    so i called dr immediately and went in for bloodwork and sure enough my level was 654 so i am about 3 weeks pregnant, which means i got pregnant 2 weeks after my miscarriage!    i was shocked!    has this happened to anyone? if so, was your baby healthy? we are so scared.
1174,as anyone who  s ever smoked marijuana knows, getting a job, even weeks after smoking a single joint (or part of a joint), can be daunting. many, if not most employers now require drug tests. in arizona, even driving to the job interview can be risky. according to an arizona appeals court ruling, you might now be guilty of a dui even if you aren  t currently under the influence. you could be guilty of a dui if you even have residual marijuana in your system, which can remain for weeks. from stopthedrugwar.org:the ruling in arizona v. shilgevorkyan overturned a decision by a superior court judge who said that it didn  t make sense to prosecute people for driving under the influence if they  re not actually under the influence.the appeals court disagreed, citing its decisions on earlier challenges to the duid.   the legislature intended to create a   per se prohibition   and a   flat ban   on driving with any proscribed drug in one  s system,   the court noted.   we determined that the legislative ban extends to all substances, whether capable of causing impairment or not.  because the law was drafted to protect public safety, the appeals court said, it should be interpreted broadly to include inactive as well as active compounds.opponents of the ruling argue that the law unfairly punishes medical marijuana users in the state, especially if they aren  t driving under the influence. it also discourages tourists, especially from nearby states like colorado, which has legalized marijuana, and california, which also has legal medical marijuana.determining if a driver is driving while impaired from marijuana is a challenge for law enforcement. there is currently no standard to determine how much thc is too much thc, so cops basically guess. they do rely on blood tests, but even then, safe levels of thc vary from person to person. some police departments use a series of eye tests to determine if a driver is currently stoned. here  s a video:ultimately, as legal marijuana use becomes more and more prevalent, it will probably be up to the supreme court to determine what is reasonable and what is not when a driver is suspected of being high. shilgevorkyan  s attorney plans on taking his case to the arizona state supreme court.http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/02/16/arizona-court-rules-that-you-could-get-a-dui-if-you-smoked-pot-three-weeks-ago-video/
1175,i don't know how to deal with this again.    i'm 6 weeks and just got my first levels....hcg is only 25 and prog is only 7.    i know what that means.    i had a mc back in jan and it was the worst thing ever.    and now again.    my sister tells me that i shouldn't be so emotional b/c i was only 6 weeks, but she doesn't get it. i have no children and i'm over 40, so it's apparent that i'll never have a child.    how do you keep going?    i'm so sorry to all of you who have had to go thru this even more than twice.
1176,my mother and i don't know what's wrong with her. just out of no where over a week ago, she just started to get bad pain in her knees. they have gotten swollen too. it has gotten worse since then, and she can barely move. i took her to the doctors last week to get blood work done, but she won't know what's wrong until maybe tomorrow or wednesday. it could be arthritis or she just recently thought it could be gout. does anyone know what this could be?

1178,i went to sleep with soreness in my right leg around the knee area. i woke up this morning with many different raised bumps with alot of liquid in them and soreness when touched. i'm kind of freaking out. what is this?
1179,about a week or two after my 20th birthday, i was having real bad pains in my abdomin(abdomen). after a few hours of pain, i finally went to the hospital to get checked out. my left ovary was about almost the size of a golf ball. there was a cyst that had ruptured and caused about a pint of blood internal bleeding. i went to a korean hospital. (i'm in the u.s. military, stationed in korea) the doctors cut me from one side to the other above my public line, just to remove one ovary. are they supposed to cut me that long for just one ovary? also, with my ovary being removed, affect me as well as my body in the long run? i know that i am already experiencing weight gain, depression, and the majority of the symptoms that i have read of. i know that my surgery has effected some of the decisions that i have made, is that a result of the surgery also? curious and looking for answers..
1180,i finally got my son's ot eval back for sensory processing disorder and we hve an appt. wanted to do it at the local children's hospital, but they have a 5-6 month waitin list, so i found another place that insurance covers.    i am relieved.my son has been having power struggles mainly in the mornings lately getting to school and other activities, some days are better than others.    lately, i wish i knew what to do about this, but he has started to scream at times. i live in a townhome and my neighbor complained to the office.    now i feel even under more stress.    it's just hard to know what to do. i feel so battle fatigued and run over!! i explained to the office about it and said i'm sorry and also asked the nieghbor not to come to my door, she came to my door once about it and it's very uncomfortable. i don't need the extra stress of dealing with her.i hope this therapy will help!!
1181,i had my period for bout a month, then i went to the doctor n he put me on the pill,,, then i stopped bleeding! then i forgot to take a pill then they came back????? my period started like this jus after i had my baby. will this stop me from having anymore babies?
1182,about two months after i had my daughter, i started having pains under my ribs. it felt like a giant rubberband getting tighter and tighter. the last attack i had lasted a few hours and resulted in me going to the emergency room. before i had the attacks i had a more then adequate supply of breastmilk. now i barely make 2 ounces after 12 hours. why is this? i can't find any information online so i thought i'd try this. i had to start giving her formula because she only gained 4 ounces over a 2 month period. it's frustrating because there is nothing i can do that i know of. any suggestions?- first time mom
1183,at 10 a.m. on tuesday, february 9, 2010 i had an icl procedure performed in my right eye.earlier i had been debating whether or not to get rle surgery with crystalens or tetraflex and was talked out of both by my doctor.after an hour long discussion in calgary about 5 weeks ago we decided to go with an icl. it had to be custom made for my eye because apparently my anterior chambers were too small.after the iridotomy which was done at that visit i decided to only get the worst eye done ( right ) because the iridotomy was the worst pain i've ever felt but now....i wish i would have gone with both eyes.two days later i'm back home and the vision in my right eye is fantastic.the surgery took exactly 20 minutes and i do have a dvd of the whole procedure but i cannot get it to play. i've tried 3 computers and i really don't know what the problem is. the sound is there but no video. just a blank blue screen with a musical note in the middle.i didn't feel pain during the surgery but there was definitely some discomfort even though i was given double freezing etc.anyway, i got through it and immediately put on my sunglasses as i looked like an alien ( huge pupil and no colour )i was a bit worried right after surgery because i really couldn't see much with my right eye but i think that was due to the dilation. the next day i was panic stricken as it hadn't improved much 5 feet out. close up i could see perfectly but after that it was blurred and distorted.my appointment was very early in the morning and i went through a whole battery of tests again and 2 doctors told me that one day after surgery i had 20/25 vision with j1 acuity and they told me that was very good and it would improve gradually. they said there was more than the usual amount of swelling and that was causing the distortion. i remained skeptical and then i remembered that after my rk surgery everything was upside down the next day for about 6 or 7 hours.when i woke up this morning you can imagine my delight as everything was crystal clear. i really wish i had both eyes done but if it hadnturned out well....i would have wished the opposite.the gimbel eye centre gave me a card to carry around in my wallet.it says starr surgical patient information and has the measurements of my visian icl on itdiopter: +5.0optic diameter : 5.5 mmoverall diameter: 12.0 mmi am delighted with my results and i am going to have my left eye done as soon as possible    even though i need minimal correction. i want perfection.thanks for reading this and it's a good alternative to iols in my opinion.
1184,my three year old has had to pee an unusual amount of times in an eight hour period(7 times).    should i be concerned?
1185,i am going to the bariatric clinic on friday june 22nd. they told me i would be put on mild appetite suppresants called phentermine? i weigh 215 and would like to eventually be about 145 or 150. just wanted to know some succes stories or not so successful stories to know if i will be wasting my money. this clinic is very expensive...thanks to all.p.s. what is all this about hcg? is that the new thing or something? i have never heard of it before...
1186,i'm totally disgusted and horrified that bp can get away with so much, and yet still be making as much money as they do. i'm sickened with what impact this will have on the environment and now with hurricane season....
1187,hi there,i have a question about my toddler that has been having blue lips for about 6 months.    she's 19 months old now.a month ago her lips and mouth went blue, then she suddently went unconscious, non-breathing.    she's had blood work, chest x-rays, ecg's and holter heart monitor tests that all came back normal. she saw a pediatric cardiologist who said she has the slightest heart murmer, but the degree of her murmer is so minor there's no way it'd cause her to suddenly go unconscious.now something else has happend.    she was her normal self and sudenly spaced out completey.    she was staring into space, looking towards the ground with her eyes moving back and forth slightly (like reading a book).    she was not responding to any stimulation (snapping fingers in front of her nose, calling her name, lifting and dropping her arm at her side)    but she finally snapped out of it (about 20 seconds later) when her favorite toy was shaken twice.we have now visited a neurologist who did initial tests and said she's completely normal from what he sees.    we're scheduled to do an eeg in a month but he thinks he won't find anything.he thinks it's a circulatory issue because only parts of her body (lips, hands, fingers) go blue.    he said if there was a lack of oxygen that her whole body would be going blue. he told us she'll likely grow out of it and we should stop putting her throught all these tests.so my question is: if a pediatric cardiologist says her heart is practically perfect, could she still have a circulatory issue?    i mean, if her heart is pumping as it should etc, is it possible to have a circulatory issue, and why?    where do we go from here?    any insight on the entire issue would be appreciated.many thanks.kelly
1188,ok so not too long ago i got drunk and was taken advantage of and practically raped. i was also on my period at this time. and i really cant remember what happened but im pretty sure this person didnt use pertection and im really scared about being pregnant. its almost been two weeks now since it happened and ive looked up symtoms(symptoms)of early pregnancy but so far none. and it happened the night my period started but it started early that morning. and i freaked out the next day terribly and a lot of people told me that you couldnt get pregnant on your period but we all know its possible right? and for that month i had to skip my bc pills because i was too late on taking them that month but i started taking them again like two days after it happened, while i was still on my period. it made my period stop and everything. but what do you really think my chances are of being pregnant?
1189,how can i treat my partial adrenal insufficiency without taking prednisone. i'm taking 10mg and want to discontinue it do to side effects. i've been on it for years. i'm also on hypothyroid med. i know that dosage needs to be reduced slowly but withdrawals are hard to handle. can i start with ginseng, licorice root or bupleurum root?
1190,i'm 67 years old and developed little red tears (i.e. small lesions) near the tip of the penis through frequent sex with a sex toy using what i now realize was insufficient lubrication.the cure was as follows: first, zinc ointment + lubriderm applied on a daily basis;    second, use of a really good lubricant called id glide (quite inexpensive on amazon).    i did not refrain from sex, just kept using the ointment and the lubriderm until the red tears healed.i have sex with one of my sex toys at least once a day these days, and no soreness... am still using the lubriderm after each orgasm, and using sufficient lubricant to avoid serious friction.this discussion is related toadditions to my last post.
1191,i came og the pill on 1st of september i've just had one day of very light bleeding (20 october0 was this my period?
1192,my 3 year old has a seizure disorder and is on lots of medicine.    she typically has her seizures at night.    she gets her meds between 5 and 6 every evening followed by a bath around 7ish and bed by 8.    our dillemia is that we know that if she is sleep deprivated it can bring the seizures on, but she doesn't like to go to bed.    we have relaxed our routine and allow her to go to bed later (9 or later), but it is always a fight, which usually results in kicking and screaming and then falling off to sleep followed by a seizure.    in comes the guilt and dismay we feel.    what can we do?    is there some connection between her being tired, but refusing to go to sleep and her seizure disorder?
1193,hi there, i had brownish discharge (for the first time in my life) 4 days before my period (heavy) started. can i have one last period while 4 weeks pregnant. im i the only one who thinks im pregnant and on my period?    please reply and explain brownish discharge.
1194,does anyone know how long you should hold off on using the bathroom before taking an opk. i plan to take one at 4pm its 2:30 now and i already have to pee lol.    i don't want to mess up the results by waiting to go, nor do i want to not be able to go enough at 4 urghhh.
1195,i was just sent home from the hospital, i am so disappointed, my contractions are 7 minutes a part and i guess they really want them to be 5 or less apart before they keep you.    i went in because of severe back paini am 2 cm, and 39 weeks,    anyone have experience like this and how long until you actually had your baby??
1196,mirena out since feb 11. reg cycles....except it always ends up being six, seven, eight, nine days past when i expect and always neg hpt. i'm disgusted. i think that thing ruined me.
1197,i'm 20, and for the last few months i've been having this dry, almost itchy feeling in my vagina the day after i have sex with my boyfriend. lately there has been white chunks as well. its very uncomfortable, and i'm not sure how to find a doctor here in quebec, as i don't actually live here, i'm just going to school. any help would be much appreciated!!
1198,my mum was misdiagnosed for nearly 2 years, by a doctor who obviously had no clue, she found she had cancer of the bladder, uterus and part of her kidney, she underwent surgery and now has to have a perminant bag through a stoma, she was given the all clear, 5 weeks later on a further scan she was told she wasn't all clear after all, and it had actually spread to her pubic bone, she's 56 years old, and recieved a letter this morning from the insurance her and dad were trying to sort out, saying the doctor dealing with her case had said she would have no more than 2 years to live, yet the doctor did not tell her this personally, but a third party!, im devastated, and really just wondered if anybody has had similar issues either personally, family or friend?
1199,hey , i'm 14 and the other day me and my boyfriend had sex. while he was changing for the other condom.. i'm scared some could've either rubbed on to me or on the other condom.. its already been 2 days, and yesterday night i started feeling a little fuzzy in my lower stomach .. like if i was having cramps sort of . i know its to eairly to tell but ... i'm woried . i havnt been eating normaly if that helps.. and i just got done with my period like last week so it can't be that.. and i was doing some research and some people were saying it could be my cervix ?.. i don't know . i need answers . thankss !
1200,i first want to say that i have read all the posts and you are all in my prayers.    i just recently went through withdrawal from prescription pain medication.    i had no idea i was even addicted until a doctor changed my medication.    i was clueless when the withdrawal symptoms began because i was never addicted to anything before.    even when i went to the emergency room the docs had no idea what was going on even though they saw the meds i was on and what i had been taken off of.    when i finally got to see my gp he asked me if i felt like i was going through withdrawal and all i could say was i don't know, i've never been addicted to anything    it turned out that i had a hypersensitivity to the medication that caused me to become addicted    even though i was taking a small dose.    anyway, i lost my job because the withdrawal was severe enough to cause me to miss work.    my old boss said i'm on the top of the list for rehire but with the economy, as everyone is aware, business is slow.    so i'm now in the same boat as many of you are.    my husband barely makes enough money for us to pay bills and most of our food comes from a church food bank.    i have type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure and losing weight is a little difficult right now cause most of the food given us is carbohydrates, which is really not good for a diabetic, and high fat meats.    now, sorry for such    a long post, but i am not by any means looking for sympathy because there are those in worse shape than me, i just covet you prayers.    arthritis in my hips makes standing a long time difficult but i do believe that god will help me deal with it.    i believe that as we pray for each other it will take our minds off ourselves and open up the way for god to do a work.    so now in closing  i thank you father god, that in the name of jesus, you have provided all our needs according to your riches in glory by christ jesus.    i thank for healing all my sisters and brothers in spirit soul and body. thank you father, that the joy of the lord is our strength.    i declare that jobs, finances and healing are now ours in jesus name.    amen    love you all and god bless.
1201,my period is two days late. i am a virgin and the last time i gave and recieved oral sex was before my period last month. but after that period, i went to the doctor's to get rid of a vaginal odour and i was taking some antibiotics to get rid of it and they worked. i have also been under a lot of stress lately in the past day or two.could the antibiotics have interferred with my menstrual cycle or is it the stress?
1202,hi there, i'm 16 and no one can seem to figure out what's wrong with me.about 4 weeks ago, i started having really bad abdominal pain (mainly my right flank, in between my ribs and hip). i also occasionally have it on my left side as well, but not nearly as often or severe. it feels like there is a lot of pressure on my organs and it's worse when i sit down and when i stand up suddenly.i went to a general physician and my urine came back positive for wbc. i was having a major operation the next day, so we got a ct scan just in case. it came back negative for kidney stones. i went back the next week and they took blood and urine samples again. the blood test showed that i had high glucose levels (because i had eaten within the past 4 hours) yet my kidneys were leaking ketones. the doctor put me on an antibiotic and gave me a pain reliever but my symptoms persisted. then i started feeling fatigued and just overall crappy.i have been drinking a ton of water, but i have been urinating less frequently. so i went back a third time. this time, they tested for bacterial vaginosis, and it came back positive, but i'm nearly certain that this is not what's causing my pain, especially since i've probably had that infection for a while (being 16 and not sexually active, i don't normally have too many vaginal problems). i'm just in a ton of pain and want this to go away! if these antibiotics that i'm on now (round 4!) don't work within a week, i'm going to get an ultrasound from a specialist. any ideas of what this could be? thank you!
1203,my dad just had an operations done on both eyes, but he`s experiencing eye watering on both eyes and he can not see. what do think is happening with my dad?

1206,my boyfriend & i have been having sex for 4 days straight. he is quite large and we usually have very rough sex. on the first day my vagina was fine but on the second day after intercourse my vagina started hurting. when i use the bathroom (peeing) it would hurt and burn. the next day after intercourse my vagina hurted even more that i couldn't even have sex. i looked at myself and i saw a very small cut by my perineum and one at the very beginning of my vagina. when i pee it would hurt and when i wiped there would be a little blood. it also bothers me throughout the day. does this sound like a perineum cut, or can it be something else? and if it is, is there anything to help cure it?
1207,my boyfriends 3 year old sons miles (not his real name) mother is diagnosed as schitzophrenic and bipolar.    she just recently had breakdown and was hospitalized for 2 1/2 weeks.    the first time she lost it she took miles outside in 30 degree weather    (with snow on the ground) and wouldn't come in saying that he wasn't her baby.    she has lost her apt. her car and is living with her mom so she can be taken care of .    she sees miles whenever normally everyday for a couple of hours or every other day or whenever she isn't stay at her dads which is out of town.    there was an issue last week that raised some questions for my boyfriend and i, about her mental health again, so he talked to her mother, which brought up some more questions.    miles then begin to say that mommy told secrets about daddy and myself.    and that mamaw was scarry.    apartently his mother has been telling him these things.    i think that its about time something was done legally, she still has sole custody.    and she needs supervised visitation by someone other than her mother....    need some feedback .... need some one elses opinion.... need help!!! i'm new to this!!!

1220,i just had a restore lens put in my right eye.    i know i am impatient since my surgery was less that 24 hours ago.    my distance vision is starting to get better, but my close up is quite blurry.    the unusual thing is that when i look at a black line i see three lines.    one yellow, one red and one blue.    is this normal?thanks
1221,my husband and i have been trying to conceive for 6 months.    i have very regular cycles and can calculate my expected ovulation date and our most fertile days easily and accurately. nevertheless, i was using the first response opks for the first 5 months to confirm my calculations of our best days to conceive or baby dance!.    we even started baby dancing every other day as soon as day 10 of my cycle, even with negative opks, through day 21 or so.    discouraged, we started talking to others and we decided to try clear blue digital opk after hearing others were successful using that brand.    so, this month, i used both simultaneously and was surprised when the two brands did not correspond.    i got a smiley face positive test on the clear blue 3 days before the first response, corresponding with my own calculated prediction.    the first response test only turned darker/positive 3 days after the clear blue and seemed late.    i was wondering if anyone has experienced the same problem or has any advice to offer?
1222,hi, this is my first pregnancy at age 35. i had my first ultrasound 2 weeks ago, the fetus was showing at 6 weeks. my ob said she wanted me back in 2 weeks for another ultrasound. i went back yesterday, after having an ultrasound at the office, she sent me to the hospital for a 2nd ultrasound on a bigger machine that could see better she told me that the fetus was still showing at 6 weeks. she drew an hcg quant level yesterday & ordered another for 48 hours later to see if my hormone levels are rising. she said after this she would no more & we could discull the viability of the fetus. she said she saw a nice yolk sac & could see the fetal pole. i believe there were fetal heart tones detected at the hospital as well. i am pretty much assuming the worst but i was wondering if this has ever happened to anyone & turned out ok in the end. the dr didn't seem reassuring, she seemed like she was giving me bad news. i would be grateful for any info that anyone has, thanks.
1223,i am so pleased with myself, i took my 5 yr old grandson to cadbury chocolate world and even though they gave us loads of freebees, i never had even had a nibble, but oooh was'nt i tempted.as for my heart attack i am going to hospital on the 7 april to have the angiogram, but i feel ok, still terified about the needle but wont worry till a bit nearer the time,thanks everyone for the support this forum and other forums on med help have given,elaine
1224,i have had morning sickness for about a week or more starting last sunday. everyday it has been extremely bad to where i get sick 3 or 4 times a day, and have trouble keeping anything down.    however yesterday, even though i felt really sick, never got sick and was able to actually eat. this was the first time since sunday i was actually able to eat a meal. it worried me, because i was used to getting sick and feel maybe something is wrong. this morning when i woke up i got sick., this is my first experience and was just wanting some information....does everything seem normal?
1225,i started my period today it is heavy with alot of clots. i noticed that i have a milky liquid coming from my nipples what could this be?
1226,the situation in a nutshell -1) been in an intimate relationship for 2 years being fully aware that it couldn't go 'anywhere' because of our age difference (19years - me, female, being older)2) he finds out i'm chatting to someone else, his heart breaks3) he finds someone else, i say too soon - it's a rebound4) 3 months later she falls pregnant, now she's a knocked-up rebound - he will take full responsibility as a dad5) he portrays to be the committed partner to her however he still wants to be intimate with me6) they don't have a healthy 'relationship' (sexual or emotional)7) he's a substance abuser and probably suffers from an ocd8) she comes from a broken home, no real family support - her mom is not active in her life, only her gran9) his mum is fully involved with his life and will be stricter when baby comes - totally anti alcohol10)i am so disappointed in him now, he can't follow his dreams as much as he'd like to.    do i just 'cut' myself off from the situation and walk away ... it's almost like i cannot see him 'waste' his life and in the same breath, it's not like i see myself with him for the rest of my life.is this just pity that i feel??

1230,i am concerned about my 3 year old daughter's behavior.    i am afraid she may have sensory issues or some type of autism and would like some input from others who may have more knowledge.    the things she does that concern me the most are the following:- frequent, uncontrollable tantrums- constantly walks on tip toes- grunts/screams if something bothers her- positions things in rows- insists on background noise.    i.e. loud music- can't seem to dress herself- will not toilet traindo i need to be concerned, or are these typical preschool behaviors?    any advice would be greatly appreciated.    thanks.
1231,i've been with my partner for over 4years.    we live together and have been very happy.    i always felt that there was something missing sexually, and have put it down to the fact that i don't like the way he kisses me.    sounds pathetic i know, but i really don't and i have never quite known how to tell him, so i don't.    therefore, we don't do much kissing, which tends to make sex fairly clinical.    everything else has been great, i thought i was happy.however, i've started to have an affair.    it's very sexual and has now been going on for months.    i have tried to end it, but i have become addicted to the desire and passion which has been missing from my relationship.    i know it is a short term high, and the love i share with my partner is long term, but i can't help thinking without the desire, are'nt you just friends?following an argument last night, i ask my partner to move out.    he is now out looking for flats and i'm scared i've made a bad call.    more importantly, i think the fact that he has accepted my request without a fight indicates he probably doesnt love me as much as i thought.    serves me right....
1232,just lately i have had white smelly sticky substance coming from my vagia. im too embarresed to talk to anyone about it and i need advice on what to do

1236,half of all sunscreens, (those using vit a, retinol) have been found to accelerate cancer in mice. the fda has known this for more than a decade.i use them sometimes but do not nor have ever trusted them. i guess because they can enter the body thru the skin. tho i do believe too much sunshine like anything, can be harmful i am much more comfortable with gods creation rather than mans. maybe im just old fashioned.what say you?do you use them.    will these products come back to bite us or do you feel like they are safe?
1237,spotting since last month    blood came 3 days before period was to start. this month bleeding came 5 days before period is to come. took about    5 pregnancy test in the past three months all negative. i am very upset . anyone going through the same or experience the same thing?
1238,i have had recent bleeding between periods - and had an ultrasound last week which showed up a white area (small mass) in my uterus on the screen.    it was suggested then to do a vaginal ultrasound - this showed a clear picture of this white area.    it is only small 1 x 1cm - my doctor cant get me into a gynaecologist for 2 1/2 weeks.    i am fairly concerned about this and wonder whether i should be having further tests prior to the gynae visit ?    also the ultrasound reporter suggested a further vaginal ultrasound but my gp said not to do this and wait for my specialist appointment. curious as to whether other people have had similar lesions appear on ultrasound and their outcome.
1239,i need to know if anyone has had a successful pregnancy using a progesterone supplement after a pregnancy has already occured.    i have read that it should be started after ovulation for it to be effective.    i was seeing an arnp who specializes in fertility, then got pregnant and had a m/c and was seen by a doctor.    i called her nurse today hoping to get a progesterone level drawn based on my + lh surge and she told me the doctor does not check progesterone until after i am sure i am pregnant.    i am wondering if i should go back to the arnp, but would like to know if prog. supplemention after a pregnancy has started is effective.thanks, this is a really great site and i will appreciate any insite i can get.    i just don't want to miss any chance of a healthy pregnancy.    another m/c would be devastating for me!
1240,my husband and i have tried to get pregnant for a year.    i have pcos.    i've been on metformin for 6 years and have a normal menstrual cycle so i assumed i was ovulating.    however in the last year i had never once gotten a smiley face when using a ovulation stick.    also my bbt never really changed.    so my doctor prescribed 50 mg clomid which i started last month on day 3 (my cycle started december 1st.    i ended up seeing a change in my bbt around the 19th and on the 20th i finally got a smiley face.    however, here i am at month two and my second dose of clomid.    i realize it's only my second dose but after trying for a year my heart is just breaking.    we want a baby so badly.    my doctor says most likely i was the problem as i wasnt' ovulating however when do i have my spouse go in and get checked?    i guess i'm more so looking for someone in the same boat as me.

1248,my 15yr old daughter has been losing her sight.    sept 11/07 was here 1st issue.    her vision was gone for 20 minutes, both eyes, totally black.    she has since had numerous testing done.    mri, eeg, ekg, carotid ultrasound, echo cardiogram, wore heart monitor for 2 wks, various blood tests.    after her mri, the pedriatric neurologist in nov 2007 said her test was fine & it was all stress related.    she had various periods of vision loss, 1 minute in duration, thru 2008.    march 10/09, she lost her vision for 15 minutes.     took her to our family doctor for more testing.    the heart specialist suggested seeing a neuro ophthamologist, he feels the problem is from the back of the brain toward the eyes, circulation is somehow being blocked.     he explained for both eyes to lose vision at the same time, 2 blood clots would need to travel at the same time to both areas of the brain.    highly unlikely in his opinion.    her eyes have been tested 3x & are fine.    the question is, what type of doctor should she see.    is the neuro ophthamologist the correct doctor or is there another specialist that could be suggested?

1260,whenever i get an erection, my penis is very stiff and erect, i.e. it basically sticks up almost vertically to my body,. it actually hurts to have it in a horizontal position such as when my girlfriend wants to be on top, and any lower than that is unimaginable. i've been too embarrased to ask a docter or anyone else if this is normal but from what i've seen in adult videos (which i acknowledge are not that credible) it does not seem too be, so should i see a doctor for this or is it normal?

1279,hey. i just joined tonight. my son, joshua aiden day, of 8 months passed away the 2nd of march from sids. i don't really talk about it to anyone. i don't cry about it, i just stay angry all the time. i feel like it's my fault. even though everyone in my family or that knows me tells me it's not my fault, i feel like they are just saying that to make me feel better. i miss him so much. my little monkey was the best little boy ever. he hardly ever cried and he was always smiling and laughing. aiden changed my life and got taken away from me. now i feel like i have nothing to live for anymore. i feel like i was a bad mom... i don't know what to do anymore. is anyone else going through this.

1281,doctor,i've suffered with depression and anxiety for years.    although, just recently, i've started prozac (still too early to tell of my progress).    however, the past year, i've also picked up another wonder mental disorder - hypochondria (makes sense, doesn't it?).    it started with a bad bruise and migraines combined with depersonalization.    eventually, the migraines stopped and thankfully, the depersonalization went away after a few weeks.    i mistakenly googled illness that matched my symptoms and came across hiv.    talk about the worst 6+ months of my life!    i knew i had it.    but 2 tests later (one at 4 months and one at 6 months), i was proved wrong.    although, i still have those days where i just know i have it.    since then, i've had various episodes of a sore throat.    it started with tonsillitis (something i've never had before).    i have large tonsils to begin with.    but since i've gotten tonsillitis, i've had a sore throat on and off.    it's usually like once a month.    i've always had unusual bowel movements (i hardly ever go).    but recently, it's been kind of crazy.    i've also dealt with a lot of nausea and loss of appetite.    i haven't lost any weight, though i've admittedly gained a few pounds.    some days are better though.    i had a very bad yeast infection from the antibiotics and i went through a month phase of thinking i had herpes.    negative blood test and negative culture tests.    i've been tested for all stds and it is all negative (multiple times).    i've had two cbcs done and all normal.    my pap smears are also normal.    i have had ultrasounds done and a sonohystogram done.    all normal.    i'm recently thought my broken tooth was the cause of it all.    i thought i had an infected tooth and it was causing me problems.    i'm getting surgery on monday to remove the tooth, as well as my wisdom teeth.    but, the doctor said i didn't have a tooth abscess.i'm so confused.    what is with the recurring sore throat?    what's with my crazy stomach and bowel issues?    any more tests you'd recommend?    i'm ready to leave this part of my life.    i've been playing the guessing came for a year now and no doctor is that helpful.
1282,i am 15 years old and have had my period since i was 10. never in those 5 years have i missed or had a late period /or any other weird thing with my period. i am not a virgin and within the last month have had my period 3 times. each of them were light spottings lasting about 5 days. inbetween each period i have had exactly 6 days off. i'm am struggling to figure out whats going on with my body? could i possibly be pregnant?

1288,this was in our paper. i thought it was interesting enough to pass on. i totally agree with this writer. what do you all think?the naked truth about intrusive airport scannersby steve chapmanto judge from the news accounts, umar abdulmutallab did everything to get himself caught except wear an osama bin laden t-shirt onto that northwest airlines flight christmas day. yet the danger didn  t dawn on anyone until he allegedly set himself on fire while trying to detonate the explosives hidden in his underwear.so the solution being proposed is the one we hear whenever the government fails: give it greater power.this is a common liberal impulse. the public schools aren  t educating students adequately? they need more money. the stimulus didn  t rev up job creation? pass another one.but when it comes to national security and law enforcement, the same tendency afflicts many conservatives. they generally think the federal government could screw up a three-car funeral, but they expect it to perform with flawless efficiency in finding murderous fanatics. and if it fails, they look to expand its authority to do the job it botched.this is not true of everyone on the right. one of the ideas already in the works is screening all passengers with full-body scanners that let transportation security administration agents see through clothing. michael chertoff, who was secretary of homeland security under president george w. bush, has urged their expanded use, while ridiculing   privacy ideologues, for whom every security measure is unacceptable.  but last year, a bill sponsored by rep. jason chaffetz, r-utah, banning the routine use of these machines easily passed the house, with the support of two out of every three gop members. at the time, he warned,   the images offer a disturbingly accurate view of a person  s body underneath clothing, even allowing transportation security administration officials to distinguish gender or see the sweat on a person  s back.  that vote might come out a little differently today, but chaffetz is not backing down.   i think that  s the challenge for our society, and there is no simple, easy answer: how do you find that right balance between protecting your personal privacy and yet the need to secure, say, an airplane,   he told public radio station kcpw in salt lake city. yes, there are republicans who think there are limits to how much privacy we should relinquish in pursuit of security.very few of us would be willing to get naked in front of a uniformed agent for the privilege of getting on a plane. but the scanners would have the same effect. how graphic are their images? british authorities barred the use of scanners for travelers under 18 for fear of violating child pornography laws.chertoff takes comfort that the officers inspecting the images would not know whose unclothed form they  re viewing and that the faces would be blurred. he seems to assume we can always trust every one of those government employees. (if i were an attractive woman, i  d have particularly strong doubts.)it  s not reassuring that, as chertoff notes, travelers could opt to get pat-downs instead. any pat-down aimed at making sure you aren  t carrying explosive powders in your crotch is going to stir unpleasant memories of your last physical.as it happens, the sacrifice involved in mass use of the full-body scanners, which tsa is already planning, would probably be futile. a conservative member of the british parliament who previously worked for a company making scanners said that   in all the testing that we undertook, it was unlikely that it would have picked up the current explosive devices being used by al-qaida   -- including those used in the christmas plot.the more intractable problem is that terrorists are fiendishly capable of adaptation. if the scanners can find plastic explosives hidden in underwear -- which is not guaranteed -- the evildoers have another option that would foil these gadgets: hiding the bomb in a body cavity.that  s exactly how one suicide bomber tried to assassinate the prince in charge of counterterrorism for saudi arabia. the charge went off, and the prince was lucky to survive. today, full-body scanners. tomorrow, cavity searches?preventing an airbus from being blown up, of course, doesn  t mean preventing a terrorist from killing large numbers of people. if we secure commercial planes, jihadists can set off their bombs in sports venues, subway cars, shopping malls or other crowded places.so here  s the sad reality: if we insist on preserving what little remains of our privacy, we will remain at risk of a terrorist attack. and if we give it up? ditto.steve chapman blogs daily at newsblogs-chicagotribune.com/steve_chapman

1301,i got the nuva ring from my doctor and was told to wait until the sunday after my next period to put it in. i had just gotten off my period when she gave it to me so i decided to wait until my next one. i started my last period on april 13...its now may 17 almost the 18th and still no period. the day i got the nuvaring i was curious to see if i could feel it during sex. i put it in to try it out but took it out right after since i wasnt supposed to use it yet. i took a test on the 11th and it was negative. i was wondering if that short time i had it in if it would effect my period.

1310,hi everyone.    i had an ultrasound last week at about 19.5 weeks and decided not to find out gender of the baby.    now my curiosity has gotten the best of me and i find myself scrutinizing some of the pics from the dvd we brought home.    what do you all think?    the black and white ones are where the baby has it's knees pulled up.    the other split screen is a 3d from the backside and what i believe is the same pic just an inside view. (this was the picture that captured my interest as i thought something looked fairly obvious!)    opinions? boy or girl?thanks!
1311,my 43 year old sister has been having great difficulty breathing when she tries to walk or walk up stairs.    she can hardly breathher heart races, she sweets and goes dizzy.    she has had tests done at the hospital but now her doctor tells her that they cant find anything wrong with her.    it seems very obvious to me that there is something wrong with her.    the doctor just sent her away so what does she do now.    she has been like this for around 3 to 4 weeks and it is not getting any better.    she is also feeling very unwell now.
1312,i didn't have a cycle in february and i had two in march, but i didn't have one in april. it's the beginning of may and i still haven't had a cycle yet. i keep loosing and gaining weight. i'm always hot and have to sit in the front of the fan, sometimes i feel like i want to vomit or throw up. i can only lay a certain way in the bed to get comfortable and i'm having mood swings. this isn't like my body. i currently have a mirena implanted in me. so does this really mean that i am pregnant. i am really confused.
1313,hi,i have two lines under each eyes so i've started using an eye cream. i'm just wondering, will this eventually repair itself since i'm only 16? i see people or are 30 and have no lines under their eyes.secondly, i'm only 5'3 and grown around 4 inches since starting puberty. i haven't been in puberty for even a year yet, but seem to have progressed everywhere else. voice broke, can ejaculate, penis has grown, pubic hair, and a few underarm hairs, but can't be seen unless you look close. my parents are both small, mum is around 5'1 and dad around 5'5 5'6. i'm just wondering, is there any possibility i will grow a few more inches?
1314,so i have posted something already concering i might be pregnant. i took a plan b two days after i had unprotected sex and he came in me. i got my period although it was diffenet and then continued to have spotting the next two-three days after my period, its been 3 1/2weeks since, i have horrible gas and bloating, peeing more often, slightly tender breasts and now i am feeling weird stomach feelings, hard to explaine, and then as a girl im sure most of you might know this feeling, its almost like you are going to get your period. i get a feeling similar to that but if i were to get my peirod its not due for another week and a half. is this signs of pregnacy?
1315,tonight i had sex with my girlfriend. we had protectected sex. after we were done i pulled out and the condom came off inside her. i think a small amount of sperm got in right on the inside. does it have to go all the way back or can she get pregnant if it was only a half an inch in?
1316,i haven't had a period in 13 years because i was on depo-provera. because of some concerns with the length of use with the depo, i got an iud in june '06. i was period-free until christmas. now i am wearing a tampon and a pad because of the flow. it is a bright red color. could this be from stopping the depo in jan. '06 and my body returning to normal? or, should i be concerned about the iud causing damage?
1317,i was seperated at the time from my legal husband due to emtional abuse,when i met bio dad i had not had children in 22 years and was told that i couldn'tguess what i did.it did not work out in the 6 months we were together the last month of our realationship i found that i waspregant,i went home        were my husband and i had currently resided                            to carry my son until he was born then give him up for adoption            because i did not want him to havethe life i did comeing from a divorced family .his bio father tried to get soul custody and was denied ,his bio father also refused to give up rights so that the adoptive parents ( doctor and nurse ) could have him the day he was born it took nine days for him to concent at that point there was no way i could give him up.since the last 10 years his bio father has not called or anythingi took him to met his bio grand mother at the age of 6 ,my husband was furious i did not go again.at this point i have now been married to my husband for 29 years he has always been there for my sonrecently i have become unemployed ( now 1 year ) in that year my husband has changed drasticley( he has a history of emotional abuse with me years long ) he has also threaten to leave this nov. when our 5 year bankrupt is over ,at this point i have 2 sons the other is 8 and we were blessed to have him a year and half after my 10 year oldso i guess my question really is , should i tell my 10 year old after i would get a divorce or now ,and is it wrong for me to persue bio for finacial support .     thanks hope you can understand it all.
1318,how do i stop my child from talking in class and/or using inappropriate (non-respectful) tones in her voice?this discussion is related tomy child won't stop talking.
1319,i just had my third miscarrage(miscarriage)2 weeks ago--and this is by far the hardest-- we went to a fertility center and used an egg donor.    the egg donor was pre 30's,and i still miscarried @ 6 weeks.    the fertility center we used has won many awards.    i had a d+c last week and we sent the baby to a genetic lab to determine what went wrong.    i know the only way we'll have a family is to keep trying, but what if i am defective?    there is    a saying- the third time is the charm-- in my case the third time we used a nationaly renowed fertility center- inserted    2 egg donar eggs less than 30 yrs old- only 1 attached, and then died at 6 weeks!!!!we are waiting for results of the genetic testing, but i can't help feeling this is my fault.    the only way for me to get pregnant is to keep going up this crazy expensive heart-renching hill.
1320,hello. i did a hanging job on my penis last night with 2.2 lbs for 40 minutes with 2 breaks. during the last minutes i noticed a sharp pain on the hanging area. after ending the session i couldn't even touch my penis due to pain. in the morning after waking up i noticed the left area on the shaft under the head several small dark veins have appeared which i never saw before & it is still causing a lot of pain when touched. i can have erections normally, but the pain is uncomfortable. what can i do in this case?

1323,there are so many questions i have but the main one is, why is it that i haven't been referred for a liver transplant?    is it again an insurance issue?because of the research i have done, i know that some people get really really sick before their liver fails, while others have no symptoms whatsoever, they just die one day.since having to leave my state job due to illness (hep c) and going on disability medical i have had the worse care ever.    i continually get referred to a nurse instead of a doctor when going to a clinic; gastroenterology, liver, etc.    doctors get paid so little when you are on disability, they don't even want to see you.    this is so unfair, i worked all my life to end up like this??please help answer my questions if you can.    i live in seattle, washington.
1324,i am six weeks pregnant and at four weeks my hcg level was 2230 and at 5 weeks (5 days later) it as 12224. i also am already popping out although this may be because i have already had 3 children. i am freaking out thinking i might have twins, just feel like maybe i am. does anyone know if these levels indicate twins? i know they are a kind of high.
1325,i had two miscarriages before the birth of my daughter in november . after some complications with the birth of my daughter, i was pregnant 6 weeks later! i went to 6 weeks and 1 day, and i miscarried, i did not have a d&c, but i never got a period, come to find out, i was pregnant again, and then i miscarried again at exactly 6 weeks, 1 day, i did this over and over 6 times and miscarried exactly at 6 weeks, and 1 day, until finally in march, i became pregnant with twins, i got past the 6 weeks and 1 day, so i thought everything was fine, but at 12 weeks, i miscarried, my doctor did a d&c finally, and told us to wait 2 weeks, and start trying again, but he said to be careful, because i was having so many miscarriages. we waited, i started taking prenatal vitamins, iron supplements (because i am anemic) and doing everything my doctor says to do, and here we are a year later, still trying, and ever since my d&c i have not been able to get pregnant at all. i have even tracked my ovulation. could the miscarriages of caused me to become infertile? if yes, what can i do about it? i got to the ob/gyn tomorrow, and i need some answers! can someone please suggest something?

1330,hello all,my son was delivered six months back with birth asphyxia - 2nd stage. he was in ventilation for 2 days, as he could not able to breathe by his own. later he was in nicu for 14 days and then he got discharged.he is now 6 months with good weight gain and height. he can also follow objects. in last check up, doctor said that his skull gap is closed and barely having a bit gap. he is also delaying social smiles.i have been advised to take my son for some simulation program where they will train us some exercises for baby which may help my baby's development.i am totally depressed. i don't know what to do. is there any therapy for developing brain cells or for brain improvement.please suggest.
1331,so heres some historybritton slept like an angel the first couple weeks home from the hospital. (mostly in her cuddle-u pillow like a boppy)then my mil came to visit and she was held a lot. sometimes to sleep. so for a few weeks i just held her til she was dozing off then put her in her bed. she would always sleep about 1.5-2 hrs. be up for an hour, then back down for a nap. then 2 weeks ago my sister in law came to visit and britton would get very overtired and wouldnt go to sleep so my sil would rock her to sleep. and she doesnt like sleeping in her pillow, or to be swaddled most of the time. so for 2 weeks ive been dealing with an overtired baby. she constantly wanted to nurse to sleep too so i had to break that habit because she would wake up after 30min. i gave her pacifiers for about a week but now she wont sleep without one and wakes up after 30min too because she cant find it. so i took it away 3 days ago and everything went downhill from there. the only time she sleeps for 2-3 hours is when its at night. daddy gives her baths at night and then she eats and goes to sleep. i always make sure shes awake when i put her down for bed time. she wakes 2 times at night to eat. usually 3-4 hours apart. (sleeps from 10-12 hours a night) so for naps she wakes up after 30min and i go in there and shes still exhausted so i try to get her to go back to sleep. but basically the wole cycle starts over again and she goes for my breast or looks for a paci. ive tried letting her cry but she will go for 15min. i try to calm her while shes in the crib. doesnt work so i rock her and she may or may not calm down.    wait until shes dozing off and stop rocking her. if she stays calm i try to lay her down. she screams bloody murder. i dont know what else to do. ive tried so hard to get her to stay asleep but im not going to give her a paci again because then i'll need to go in there every 30min. she will only fall asleep when shes exhausted any advice? im losing my mind and sick of hearing a crying baby. should i just give her the paci back since she wakes up after 30mn anyways?
1332,ok i've been on my period for a month already and i dont know why i did use any kind of birth control?
1333,my husband and i have been married for three and half years.    we became best friends prior to getting married and our marriage was very good since we shared such a good relationship.    a few months ago my brother in law moved in with his wife.    they have a very bad relationship and were always fighting and even beating each other.    it ruined the peace in my house and my husband and i would spend more time fixing their fights or arguing over their problems, then taking care of ourselves.    after that, my mother in law came.    she was fine with me the previous two times she visited and stayed with us (always stayed like 3 months at a time), but this time, she totally changed on me.    she manipulated my husband into believing that i was disheartening her and that i was not giving her respect.    my husband was never home, so it was my word against hers.    she would go through our stuff in our room when we both were at work and she would stand outside my bedroom and listen to our conversations.    i caught her many times, but ignored.    finally, one day i told my husband and started fighting with me over it.    then, when he asked her, she denied it.     after my mother in law left, she kept calling my husband when i wasn't around and feeding him negativity about me.    she kept crying and doing drama that i hurt her feelings and that is why she left.    i didn't understand what was going on because she never did that to me before.    if you met her, you would think she's the nicest mil in the world.during all this my brother in law started putting negative thoughts in my husbands head, too.    my sister in law told me one day that my mother in law and brother in law are trying to control my husband because he worships the ground i walk on and they don't like it.     she also told me that her husband (my brother in law) has been trying to turn her against me so that we won't get a long.     i didn't know how to react, so i just took it as information and ignored it.    i figured if i don't get involved, then nothing will happen.all this kept adding up and one day my husband and i got into a huge fight.    his brother and mother had made up lies and totally provoked him against me.    i told him it wasn't true and he didn't listen, so i walked out of the house.a day later, we made up and he promised that he would take care of the issues his brother was causing.    however, that lasted about a minute, because the second i entered the house again, his brother caused more problems.    this time, the sister in law back-stabbed me too and lied that i said things which i didn't.     my husband stood there against me with all of them and at that time i mentally broke down and decided that i needed to be separated.    there were too many misunderstandings and my husband was not ready to listen.    on top of that, his family was just lying left and right to make sure all their bull s*** gets covered up.a lot of things went down...it was a nasty fight between both families.    i also reacted out of anger and so did they. however, despite what he did and his family did, i still want to be with him.        it's been three months that we have been separated and the other day he sent me a legal notice indicating there will be no reconciliation.    he wants divorce.    in the past three months, i have cried, i have begged, i even went to see him (we are long distance right now), i emailed him, i tried to have his friends and family talk to him - i mean..everything has been done from my side to reconcile even though i am not the root cause of this problem.    his own family and friends told me that he is being an idiot and is wrong, but because he is so close to his family and blindly trusts them, he doesn't have the guts to stand up for what's right for him.i am very heartbroken and hurt.    i love him a lot and i know deep down he loves me too.    but he doesn't have the courage to stand up for me against his family.    his problem is not me at this point, his problem is that his family has a problem with me.    i don't know what to do...i initially walked out to save myself mental torture (my sister in law is a mental depression patient and takes pills because of how my mother in law ruined her relationship with her husband), but this is not any better.     i want my husband back, but he fails to see the truth.    he fails to realize that we both were perfect before his family came.    he is the kind of guy who couldn't even spend one hour without talking to me and now its been three months and he has had no heart to come and even give us a chance.    he didn't even tell me he wanted divorce.    he emailed it to me!the worst is that he is doing all this because his family is forcing him to.    so he's making himself believe all these lies about me and he wrote me nasty emails pointing fingers at my character and all these fabricated stories from what his mother and brother have told him.    he has created this negative false image of me so that he could get through this.    i don't know what to do.    in our country mother in laws are a huge problem and they are known to brainwash their sons because of jealousy, ego, and wanting control.    i would have never thought she was like that, but boy was a i wrong!i don't know how to get through this.    my husband refuses to talk to me, his family has forced him to cut off all contact with his friends and relatives, and his family also hasn't tried to resolve this.
1334,all i have to do is turn my head to the right and there will be a silver flash in my right eye without blinking. could there be a nerve involved because i was injured from a fall from a horse years ago?
1335,i have an odd experience to share and i am not sure what it is and i am not able to get into my doctor's office until next wed.    ok here it is...    in sept i took a pregnanct test and it came back a weak positive, so i retook one 24 hours later and it was negative.    ok no big deal b/c i got a period etc that month and one again last month although it was very short.    yesterday i noticed movement that felt like fetal movement (i have 2 children and felt them move very early on so i know what it feels like)    and no it's not gas.    very odd and wondered if anyone else had anything like this happen and they turned out to be pregnant????
1336,i went to the doctor when i was 8 days late and took a blood test and it was negative,    he said it was a hick-up in my overies and now i am at 29 days late no spotting no period and i've taken 8 pregnancy tests and all negative. ive never been pregnant and never missed a period.    i am so lost and dont know what to do?????????????????????? my period is every 27 days so that means that i am late again...what am i supposed to do just wait??i have no symtoms(symptoms)other than a little gassy and a little gas reflex and my boobs have grown just a little but not to much.
1337,i can completely relate to the question previously asked. i have a 10 year old step son who is cute, charming, hilarious, but does not give a hoot about school. he lives with me and his father full time and sees his mother (when she is not working) every other weekend. i know he craves attention from her (something she does not quite understand after telling her continually) and i try to be the best supliment that i can, by helping him check over homework, doing projects with him, having dinner with just the 2 of us sometimes, etc,,,i have been in his life for over 3 years now (since 2nd grade) and when he started 3rd grade it all began - lying about homework, lying to get out of trouble, hiding important information from us... we take everything away and he does chores for weeks at a time while only being allowed to read for fun and as soon as the punishment is over, he continues to be dishonest (he is now in the 5th grade) and the cycle repeats itself. he truly doesn't find school to be a necessity - i'm pretty sure he looks at it as a way to pass time.the advice that the doctor gave to the previous question was to seek counseling as parents (for the father and mother), but what do you do when the mother is dishonest? she repeatedly tells stories (big planned out ones sometimes) and she is very vendictive - not out for the child's well being. if his father suggested counseling, she would probably turn it around to make him look like an unfit parent - which i can reassure you he is not. his father goes to the school regularly to talk to the teachers about his grades and behavior - they know him as the primarty parent, and he plays catch with him every chance he gets which is about 3-4 days a week.is there anything we (me and his father) can do since we are with him most of the time? are there any tricks that we haven't thought of?this discussion is related toapathetic child.
1338,i am very scared of doctors, hospitals, tests, needles, medicine. the only medicine i use is my inhaler for asthma if i really need it. i have allergies/chronic sinus problems, and i can't even take pills for that. i have had a digestive disorder, undiagnosed, for the past 2 years and it controls my life, all i can mostly eat is white bread, noodles, rice, some veggies, lean meat and water. my immune system has never been good and i get stressed and sick very easily. i also have some anxiety issues. last month by chance i actually went to the er for kidney pain, because of kidney stones, but i couldn't even take any pain meds for it and that pain was really bad. but then went away a while later. i think i've been getting kidney stones sometimes this year. i let them do a cat scan and ultra sound and that's all. they said they couldn't find anything wrong with my kidneys (and i believe they are wrong) but they said they found a cyst, and called it an ovarian cyst...even though it's not even attatched to any ovary. it's behind my bladder and 12 cm big. i went to a gynecologist, i didn't let her do anything...just talked and left. she wasn't even that helpful. then, my mom made me go to another gynecologist, who's also a surgeon. and he said this thing, although they don't think it's cancerous from what it looks like, is big and has to be removed or    it could rupture or seed out into other areas of my body, which would mean i'd be needing surgeries all of my life for tumors. they wanted blood work and for me to have an exam, but no way i am ever having an exam, and i am still trying to get myself to get a blood test. it's so hard for me, all of this.anyways....i am so very terrified of surgery...and everything. i can't handle this. i don't know what i'm going to do. i don't think i'd make it. with how my health is, i don't know if i will really recover good enough and what if i get a serious reaction to the anesthesia. what if something goes wrong? and what if i get a serious side effect or blood clots or just anything? and i can't handle blood tests, what if i can't breathe well enough because of my asthma?i'm mostly worried about after surgery. during it, you don't feel or remember anything right? but what if you wake up during it? and i heard you get a breathing tube and catheter. ugh. i don't want some catheter. it's disgusting, uncomfortable and embarrassing....well, everything is embarrassing about surgery too. but i hate all of this. and there's risk for infection. and i hate ivs. everything about all this, im so phobic about. this is why i never really go to doctors, and i don't take medicines. *sigh* there's more to it. it's so much to try to explain. i'm just looking for advice or something.
1339,my 4 yr old nephew told his nana that when him and my daughter were watchin a tv show together that my 7 yr old daughter pulled up her shirt and told my nephew to kiss her boobs, her belly and then her butt. when i asked her about this she said it didn't happen. i asked if either of them had touched each other's private parts or if any kissing had happened. she told me no she didn't do it and that she didn't want to ever talk about it. i am concerned with this as i feel she is not telling me what happened. i assured her she nor my nephew would get in trouble over it and she again said she did not want to talk about it. i don't want to be pressing so i stopped, but where should i go now with it? should i take her to a professional? or just check out some local books and videos from the library and make sure she is well educated in this department of inappropriate touching and kissing?
1340,i have had yest infections for the past few years and tried probiotics, diflucan (fluconazole) every week, even got a medication for a bacterial infection (metrodinazole) but symptoms kept on coming back, i had to pair the treatments with monistat and looks like it works less and less. went to see my dr to pass pap tests, std tests and all where negative besides the yeast infection that keeps coming back! could this be hormone related if in my family genetics everyone has had thyroid problems and i still havent tested to see if i have any so if i do my hormones arent balanced? i have tried almost everything for the past 4 years so if anyone has any advice please let me know!
1341,i was about 2week late for my period i took a test just incase yeh it came bak negative and now im on my period but could there be a chance i could be pregnant while on period??

1343,my sister has a bump on her vigina(vagina)and she said it's really painfull what could it be? i told her to go to the doctor and there's no way she'll go. she's only 16 years old and is still a virgin. please help. thank you for your time.
1344,when i was shaving last night, i noticed a lump on one side of my vagina, close to the lip. it's a little smaller than a pea and it's kinda hard, but not very (i mean, it doesn't feel like a rock, but it isn't squishy either. it's right in between the two.), and it only hurts just enough for me to notice when pressure is applied. i'm not sexually active and am still a virgin, so i seriously doubt it's an std. has anyone ever had something like this? any ideas on what it could be and if i can treat it without a doctor visit, at least for a while?

1354,hi everyone. i'm really hoping you can give me some advice here and share your personal experiences. i'm 29 years old. i've been off oral contraceptives for two years.the last year i've been experiencing brown spotting before my period for about a week although last month it was two days before my period. it's not a lot but enough to wear a pantyliner as it does stain my panties and it's thick not watery (sorry tmi!). it does come along with some very mild cramping and bloating. i also seem to have more gas too (sorry again tmi!).i am so worried that something is wrong with me and am scared to go to the doctor. i'm frightened that i have a polyp or fibroid or something. i'm also scared i could have problems getting pregnant or staying pregnant. i have myself all worked up over this.i have normal periods other than the spotting. when i do have my period, i don't have an abnormal amount of bleeding and my cramps aren't totally painful. i bleed for the usual five days. never had an abnormal pap. oh, and the last two months my boobs have been sore pretty much all month long. they get extremely painful around ovulation time though. the sore boobs all month long is kind of a new symptom. last month, i thought i was pregnant because of the sore boobs but i wasn't. has anyone else experienced these symptoms and gotten a diagnosis?

1356,good morning or evening or day or night or afternoon ladies and gentlemen and hello. i have been training with a personal trainer named bradley for approximately three weeks now because i wanted to lose weight and gain muscle in the arms and shoulders.i am sixteen. i am beginning to see the signs which say that it might be working. i am getting hungry rather easy and quickly after a meal which apparently means i am burning fat reserves, i am gaining fluidity and i am able to get to the higher weights on nearly all the machines.btu there is one thing i am a little bit concerned about. i am sleeping less and less. after 3 minutes of sleep at 10:49pm, i wake up, decide to check my mh and listen to my favorite song a couple more times. it is now 10:57pm. people sleep at ridiculous times and i might be becoming one of them. i wake naturally before 10am too. all the time!is it just another sign i am losing weight or something else?try answer with the information you have been given, but if you need more, just ask. thank you...
1357,i'm a woman in my 50's, not overweight but definitely out of shape.    i'd like to use weights to tone my triceps and maybe build stength.    what kind of weights should be used?
1358,i am two weeks postop with a crystalens hd in my left eye.    my distance vision is great, but i am not yet accommodating to intermediate and near.    i am not worried about this yet.    what is going on that has me puzzled is that every time i change what i am looking at i get a quick 'wiggle' which i can see in my left eye.    by this i mean i can actually see the iris move in the mirror, looks like a quick shake of a jelly.    sadly i am seeing the regular optha and not the surgeon for my postop appointments, and it was clear this doc had never seen such a thing.    also sadly this doc didn't bother to talk to the surgeon to see what may have gone on during the operation, even forgot which lens i had.i am guessing the new lens is _trying_ to accommodate, but some viscous stuff was put in the front part which won't go thru the iris opening easily and thus the wiggle, as the eye tries and gives up on the lens movement since it meets resistance.    has anyone seen this wiggle?
1359,well i think i am just a mess...    :) about 3 years ago a grapefruit sized cyst and they removed an ovary.    i have been trying to conceive on and off (2004 the obgyn put me on clomed but did not explain anything to me about how to use it so there were 3 months that went down the drain) then in 2005 when we started to try again, my husband quit his job and couldn't find another for around 5 months, then hated the job he got for an addit 4 months.    we wrote those unsuccessful months off to stress and lack of knowledge about ov tests.    at the end of 2005 i was put on clomed again for 2 months and this time was explained when to have bd and when to use the ov tests.    but this was the first time i had used the tests and i don't think i did them right (i think the clomed caused false results and i stopped testing before ov).    i have had phys tests done, i am ovulating, the sperm count is fine, my tube is open, the only thing that is problematic is my menstrual cycle.    it is about every 20-23 days and lasts either 4 days (i think that is from the removed ovary side) or it is a normal week long.    but now everything is great at home, we moved, husband loves his job and i am a stay at home wife and are starting anew.    but my question is: should we try for a few months again before going to a specialist(which didn't work the past two times as both seemed ignorant to infertility -the second wrote me off and told me to try ivf)or do you think the chances are slim of getting pregnant naturally, since my cycle is so short and i am missing an ovary,and that i should seek pro help?
1360,i have had cramp like pain for the last few days but my period is not due for 9-10 days.    my husband and i have been ttc but i had an early miscarriage on 1/9/2010 ( we were only about 5 weeks along)    my body was acting strange about a week after that so i took a pregancy test just to make sure and it was negative.    now, this weekend i started having heavy cramp like pain.    it comes and it goes.    it is more painful when i am walking or using the toilet.    it is not a bladder infection because it doesn't hurt to urinate.    has anyone had anything like this?
1361,help please, i have a five year old little girl who is very mature for her age and seems to understand most things. however, ever since i can recall she has always been very challenging and things do not seem to be getting better. lately she will not listen to anything i or anyone tells her, and she is extremely rude to family members and friends, and when told off or punished she throws tantrums. her father and i have tried everything from postive reinforcement to punishment, but to no avail. we her absolutely at our wits end, as no consequences seem to matter to her and her behaviour is causing a major strain on the whole family.i have recently given birth, and i find that it is very difficult to tend to the baby as most of the time is sent desplining her. we are loving parents who always consider her needs, we have tried talking to her and listening to what she has to say about her behaviour, but nothing is work. now she is due to start school and we are concerned that she might face severe difficults with other children and teachers if this continiues. please help understand we are missing or where we are going wrong.
1362,my 3 1/2 year old son wasa llate talker and is still receiving speech services.    he is doing well talking but now i am concerned with him mastering some basic skills.    i work with him and he still doesn't know his colors or shapes.    he knows the names but gets them all mixed up.    same issue with letters.    should i be worried (because i am)?    there doesn't seem to be anything i can do to see if there is a learning issue at this age.    any advice?
1363,my son was a wonderful baby, but things have been out of control lately, he has never developed the speech he should have by now, he is violent with everyone and often throws tantrums even before he tries to get something, and is denied. he hits his 6 year old sister, my mother, myself and the cat for no apparent reason. my husband moved out of our family home 6 months ago, i blame that, yet i know that the speech was never developed. the behavior problems have increased since this change. he screams randomly for no reason, he is getting an evaluation from pre-k in a few weeks and i'm afraid he may be autistic, would it easier for me to find out that it's just a severe behavioral problem?this discussion is related tothree year old behavioral problems    does he need therapy?.
1364,for the last 4 months about once every two days i get extremely itchy (extremely) red swollen hands and feet. only on the palm and fingers, bottom of feet and toes. the only time it feels ok is when im holding something really cold. it feels like constant stinging or pins and needles and is almost unbearable to the point where tears come to my eyes. the little fat underneath the bottom of my fingers gets so large that i cant even make a fist anymore. i have no known allergies but this is starting to scare me. i go to the doctors tomnorrow but im scared nobody will be able to diagnose this until they actually see it happen. anyone ever hear of this ?

[...]tracy said he believes the deaths at sandy hook may have resulted from a training exercise. was this to a certain degree constructed? he said. was this a drill?these are obviously good, solid, in-no-way-absurd questions that must be addressed. right after we address whether the moon is maybe made of cheese, where elvis has been hiding himself all these years, and how the foreign country of kenyan hawaii snuck native son barack obama into the white house in order to take over america with socialist muslimism.okay, yes. at first glance, these might seem like ridiculous questions, which is why the university has boldly distanced itself from the professor by insisting that he does not speak for the university and his website is not affiliated with fau in any way.but lest you think that this lunatic is, you know, a lunatic, he addresses that:i describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual, he said, interested in going more deeply into controversial public events. although some may see [my theories] as beyond the pale, i am doing what we should be doing as academics.see? he's not a crackpot. just a good scholar and intellectual doing his job.http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/08/1177320/-obama-staged-newtown-shooting-with-crisis-actors-says-professor-who-is-totally-not-a-crackpot#

1369,what are the drug interactions between:nuvigilambianflexireloxycotonepenicillinoleptropotassium iodidexanaxhydrocodine 10and viagraand what are the side effects? and are they safe to take together?
1370,i am male, 23 yrs old, 5'11 and 252 lbs.i consume between 600 and 800 calories a day, take multivitamins and supplements including chromium and b-complex. a typical day for me involves two slim-fast meals and one turkey wrap with an apple for lunch.cardiovascular exercise is painful for me--i usually go into a coughing fit that can last for hours after stopping, even from only a few minutes of stressing myself. nevertheless, i try to run up and down stairs for at least 5 minutes before breakfast every day, and spend between 10-15 minutes a day doing sit-ups, divided between morning and evening.i have a 9-5 job that is mostly sedentary, though often involves me being on my feet. weekends i try to spend my extra time doing something active, but it's getting harder to afford it, so i'm looking at getting a weekend job.i have stuck with this plan for a month. a month ago, i weighed 250 lbs -- 2 lbs less than i do now.i have been trying to lose weight for years, and have tried all of the usual approaches, except for low-carb, because i can't afford the things i need to meet those dietary requirements. even resorting to starving myself has only served to slow my weight-gain. the most i have ever lost was 3 lbs, by not eating at all for 3 days, which i quickly gained back as soon as i started eating again.at this point it is becoming a serious health hazard for me, since i can't afford to provide my own medical insurance, and my physique is starting to depress me. i need new ideas for ways to lose weight--at least 70 lbs--and keep it off.
1371,my grandson is in need of a doctor and we dont know what kind exactly. he has been to every kind you can mention and yet no one can diagnose him.    he was sexutally abused by the parent and it was not able to be proven. my daughter has done everything in her power to help her boy. she has lost jobs because she is the one running him to the doctors offices, therapist office and general doctors appointments. she is the one up at night during feedings, nightmares, bed wetting and puking. the family of this man could afford a great attorney who got him every other weekend with the two boys. the younger boy he basically ignors but favors the son that we know he molested. my grandson came out and said it to a social worker in explicit detail and they took the father out of the picture until their lawyer came into it. we have gone through thousands of dollars for our grandboys trying to get my daughter to move back to our state of michigan. we have been in and out of court and found the judge gave the father more time with the boys. we also found out the judge went to school with the father. plus the gaurdian ad lidem , who is our grandsons lawyer in    a court of law new the grandparents on the fathers side too and recommended that they get the children more. we have been living a nightmare for several years now. now my grandson is going to kindergarten at the school the judge told my daughter to bring him to and he is causing some trouble. not some , alot. he is in detention every day and not allowed out in the playground. he is disruptive in class and hurts children. he is crying out so much and yet no one is helping him other than my daughter.they have already meet with the whole group of school and parents to try and work this out. the school says its a long process and not sure if they are labeling him as special ed or not. meanwhile my grandson sits alone every day at lunch time and if he has hurt someone at school has to come home and be punished at home for hurting a young friend during shcool . he does not seem to be to bothered by it though. that scares me a lot. someone in above forum mentioned charles manson and that is what i was thinking. where do we go? no one is doing anything for her. he has been with the same therapist for a year and is being tested to adhd but this is not the answer. is there any doctor anywhere in this country who could check him over and help. perhaps it is the fact that he has been abused. then why isnt anyone doing anything about it?    help us please come to some answer. i am willing to fly my grandson anywhere    we can if someone can help him.
1372,so, here's the case, very graphical so that both reader and the neurotic writer can haver the details clear:last week i did twice a blowjob to my boyfriend. he never eyaculated, but preseminal liquid did come out and i touched it. i also touched his penis with my hands. he briefly touched it too. we waited for like five minutes more or less, stroking our hair and chests and kissing each other. he also stroked my pants. then we both washed our hands with soap and water and we dried them off with a towel. then he did an oral to me, and to do so, he took off my pants and underwear with his hands. he also opened my vulva with his fingers and passed them through it over and over. he may have touched the vagina, i can't remember how deep if he did so. them he did the oral to me, but i said i felt like something tickled and i passed my finger over one of the outer labia sides. i was on my seventh day of my period, the prevous day i had even bled a little due to menstruation leftovers. my question is: can i be pregnant this way? if the preseminal liquid had contact with soap and water, can it cause pregnancy? for how long does sperms on the preseminal liquid last on the hands?. i have heard that the hand's acidity kills them, but i still have the doubt. i don't know if i have to believe that the preseminal liquid was washed away, could there be a risk i am pregnant even with the water and soap?. please answer soon, i really scared and freaked to death.
1373,i am 31 yrs old. i was on birth control for 6 yrs then got off. i had no period for 6 months ( i was not pregnant) then my doctor put me on provera to start my period. he also took blood and did a female exam all of which came back normal. the provera did jump start my period. it was not much lasting 3 days. now for the past 4 months i have been spotting everyday. he put me on provera again and took more blood. my hormone levels are all mormal. i am still spotting. what is going on? i spot every day during the day and then in the evening it stops. sometimes it's red sometimes it's brown. help anyone...please.
1374,i am 26 and going through one of the hardest times in my life right now. its a long story but please be patient and read it all. i desperately need your help.last summer i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i was put on an anti depressant and an anti anxiety med as needed. shortly after i met the man of my dreams. he's military and is the most amazing man. he has been through depression himself and understood what i was going through. understood the dark place i had been when i had tried to commit suicide. he was encouraging and supportive.the past 8 months he has been my best friend and my boyfriend. he has been there through thick and thin, he has helped me put the pieces of my life back together and find a purpose again. he made me feel complete. like i could finally be myself and be loved. like i could finally be completely honest with someone and not be judged or rejected. he said all the i love yous. he said that he was in love with me. he's favorite quip was its ok, we'll get through this, im keeping you, remember?about two months ago i felt so good i thought i could get off the anti depressants. he wasn't keen on the idea, but said well get through it, and if it doesn't work, we'll just get you back on them ok. im here - im not going anywhere!. about a month after getting off the anti depressant he got orders to be deployed. i feel apart. i went completely needy and paranoid that no matter how much he said he loved me, he really didnt and that he was sure to find someone else over seas. etc. i didnt really reazlie until the past couple of days that being off the medication is probably what made me act that way. usually i would be strong for him and support himtwo days before he was to fly out, he got word that he wasn't going. the deployment had been canceled. i thought he would want to crawl into his little man cave and sulk and be mad at the world for a few days. but he didn't he just wanted to be with me. it was totally unexpected. some how my irritability and snappiness got worse over the past month. i was just mean and hateful and up one min then down. i snapped back at him more than i ever have and i didnt see it until he pointed out two weeks ago and i feel like the scum of the earth.when he pointed it out, he also said that he needed time and space to think. i was a wreck. i went into full what did i do wrong? mode. i couldn't not give him time or space like he asked for, which is wrong of me i know. i had to ask why, what happened, what was going on, what did i do, yadda yadda yadda. the more questions i asked, the worse his answers got. they went from i just need time to see if this is the direction i want to keep going in to you're smothering me and i feel married, when im not! to there is no me anymore, theres just us and i have no freedoms!.monday of this week he decided that our relationship was over. that he loved me, but wasnt in love with me anymore. now i know he's been working 17 hour shifts at work, i know he's had to deal with a failed pt and numerous other stupid stunts his troops have done as well as a plane crash on base. i know my added neediness and pestering didn't help. i know that coming off my drugs was the main cause of my reactions, because normally i would never be that type of girl. i know that part is all my fault.im currently getting back on my medications because i now understand that sometimes a chemical imbalance like i have is not curable, its an ongoing battle. the past few daus he's flip between  i hate this, i dont know how to do this break up, i care about you so much to  it makes no difference any more if i see you again, there's nothing left to rekindle..you have to understand. this is a very very good man. he has is weaknesses sure, he has his moments of course. but he does not make empty promises, he does not mess with a person's heart or emotions unless he knows what he is doing. he teaches his troop members that a girls heart is special, you treat her with respect and honor, and you dont play with her heart, unless you love her and you mean it. for the past year he has said that he has intentions with me, intentions to keep me, he's told his friends this, his family this, he's done everything humaly possible outside of proposing to let me know im safe in his harms and in his heart.so what happened? i know i played my part in breaking him down. and i am mortified at my actions. i know work played a part. i dont know what to do. his best friend tells me to hold on, to not give up, to just let him get have his space and work things out. that he doesn't realize what coming off the medication did to me.on my side - im back on my medication, it'll take a while to build up - sure, but im a mess. im a wreck. i knew the second week of meeting this man that this was the man i had prayed for. im not eating, the medication makes me want to sleep all the time. i feel so depressed and rejected by the love of my life that i've waited 26 years for. im having severe anxiety attacks.    i pray for understanding, for calm, for strength. i pray for help and guidance and for courage for him as he goes through whatever it is he's going through.he says it's over, but i know in the core of my being that this is the man i've waited my whole life for and i can't give up. i dont know how to let go of it. i dont know how to give it to god. but i know i have to if there is to be any resolve. any relief for me and for him. i want to help him so so badly, but i'm not sure what to do. i keep praying the same things over and over and over and i know thats wrong too - i should have faith in my first prayer. but im not strong in my faith.please help me. please someone shed some light on what i should i do. what i should do for him, what i should do for me. i take full blame for my actions, but he's never given up on me and this is tearing me apart.

1377,hottest seller at martha  s vineyard this year: bush   miss me yet?   t-shirtsposted at 3:03 pm on august 19, 2010 by allahpunditvia jwf, a video gloss on the amazing fact that dubya is now polling six points better than obama in frontline (i.e. vulnerable) house districts. that  s not according to rasmussen either; it  s from the democrats   own surveys. no wonder the white house is looking around for a new villain: if even the bushitler seems preferable to swing voters, who  s left to demonize?an earnest question for lefties: given the state of the democrats   polling, can we finally dispense with the insane yet oft-repeated argument during the obamacare debate that passing the bill was the surest way to mitigate losses in the midterms? there were two political reasons to pass o-care, as you  ll recall: (1) long-term, passage will set the country irreversibly on the path to socialized medicine, which in turn will create a culture of dependency guaranteeing big democratic victories far into the future; (2) short-term, passage will cheer liberals and inspire them to turn out in november whereas letting the bill drop will break liberal hearts all over again a la 1993 and will ensure a republican rout in the midterms. can we now agree, with the gop reaching historic leads on the generic ballot, that the second reason has turned out to be a little, well, insane? or is the new argument that letting the bill drop last year to focus on the economy somehow would have produced an even more gigantic republican generic ballot lead? no bill = bushitler outpolling obama by 10 points instead of six in frontline districts, in other words? seriously? click the image to watch.http://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/19/hottest-seller-at-marthas-vineyard-this-year-bush-miss-me-yet-t-shirts/
1378,three weeks ago i had laser surgery for a torn retina. at my first follow up visit the surgeon    said everything looked perfect. i still have lots of floaters and light flashes in the eye. the surgeon said that the floaters and flashes will take time to settle down. can you please give me your opinion on how long these floaters and flashes usually last after laser surgery. thank you cactus jack.
1379,i developed adrenal fatigue as a result of using the inhaled steroid, advair. i quit the steroid exactly one year ago and began treatment. what helped the most was high dosages of vitamin b5 and, more recently, ashwagandha put the icing on the cake. i say i am cured because all my tests are normal, and i have regained my energy, but i am still using the supplements and will not give them up until i am really sure the nightmare is over.
1380,i am stuck in a very complicated situation. i just went to the doctor last thursday. i found out through an ultrasound that i am atleast seventeen or eighteen weeks along where my last appointment they estimated about thirteen weeks along right now. my current boyfriend and i got together fifteen weeks ago and started having sex thirteen to fourteen weeks ago. before that i was seeing a coworker, who i would love to be the father of my baby. the coworker came in me and wanted to get me pregnant, where my boyfriend always pulled out. my boyfriend has no idea he may not be the father, but has become super annoying. i don't know how to break it off with him. i would love to eventually get back with my coworker and raise a family with him, just don't know how to even pursue that. any suggestions? who do you think the dad is? i got with my current boyfriend may 24th and began sleeping with the the first part of june. i'm thinking with how much the baby has developed by the ultrasound that it is my coworkers baby.help!! :)

1413,hello,my mother had a breast recution a couple weeks ago.    she had implants removed and went from a dd to a c.    i am not sure how much tissue was removed.    about a week after her surgery, her right nipple turned black and she had an apple size necrotic mass removed.    the biopsy came back that she had a bacterial infection, so the surgeon left the wound open to heal by secondary intent.    we have been taking good care of the dressings and everything seemed to be healing ok, but then her right breast started to get hard.    the surgeon believes the necrosis is spreading and he will have to open the right brest to remove the tissue.my mom has been using heat (one of those microwavable hot/cold packs), and has been using a hand massager to attemt to break up the hard tissue.at this point we are unsure what to do.    what causes necrosis?    is this common?she is also complaining about being really tired...could that be related?should my mother get another opinion?i am open to any thoughts, suggestions, shared experiences...anythiung...thank you,

1417,my 18 month old toddler grand son has started blinking frequently, . it is the month of june. he is a very smart, otherwise healthy child, my daughter noted this to occur when he is watching tv for the past 4 days. yesterday it was it occured shortly after he woke from a nap. she asked him if his eyes hurt, he said no. when se called the pediatricians office, the office nurse asked my daughter if she thought he might be having a seizure, and now my daughter is extremely concerned. she is taking him the the pediatrician this morning. i am an rn, but i specialize in adult cardiac. i've recommended an eye exam at an eye specialist. any other advice would be greatly welcomed.this discussion is related tofrequent blinking in toddler.
1418,my 4 yr old had a ct scan of her eye done and it shows a small mass less than the size of a dime on the bone just above her eye. there have been no side effects of any kind. we thought it may be as a result of an accidental pencil stab in the same area which healed fine but the dr didn't think so.    the dr didn't schedule removal of the mass for another 2 weeks. we r obviously concerned about the likelihood of cancer. any professional opinion would be appreciated.
1419,my symptoms are:itching and swellingodor that smells fishyand sometimes a reddish brown dischargeall of these start exactly in between periods and end about a week before my period starts.i'm 20yrs old and i use the iud called paragaurd. i've been using paragaurd since june of 2009 which was a few weeks after i broke up with my boyfriend. we were sexually active for the year and a half that we were dating and i know that we were both virgins. but when i look up the problems im having, lots of people keep saying that its stds or something. i've been tested since we broke up so i know that its not stds.i also get cramps in between periods along with migrains.these cramps can be so bad that sometimes i cant even walk for a few minuets. and it really ***** when they come during my college classes.i'm going to see my gyn in june and get the iud out hopefully that will help a little.what is going on and how do i stop all of these things?

1423,hi,i live in london, as you know this is a very cold place. my son is 7 years old. for the last one he has been suffering with dryness on the above upper lip. it becomes very red, then skin patches out. some times some liquid comes out from that part. we have been to gp several times but they are not referring to dermatologist. they have been trying all types of creams and lotions but nothing working. is there anything i can do with this? i can not see him as he suffering a lot. please help me? i have a photo but i do not know how to upload here.
1424,hello,my son just turned 29 months. while updating his growth chart, i noticed and wonder why his head circumference for the past 10 consecutive months are all the same (19). is this normal?also, i think he's behind on speech. he can read and spell thirteen letters & three numbers and right now he can talk all 4 word combination.i'm a little bit worried.
1425,just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with their son, nephew etc.my boy just turned 7 and has had a closer to unique life than most others that come from a split family.he was 8 months when his mother moved away.    for the next 1 1/2 years i raised him and his sister, who had jsut turned 5 at the time, by myself.    since that time i have been the primary caregiver    and they spend the summers with their mom.    needless to say, he has had trust issues with women.    even with my current wife the first couple of years after we were together.another issue he's had to contend with is the fact that from the time he was born until my recent retirement from the military, i was gone almost 2 years total of his first 6 years.    that caused behavior issues at school and at home the last two years.the current situation, is beginning to get out of hand again.    he started off the school year great.    but after the first month of school, he's begun to sink back into that cycle of getting to the brink of serious trouble at school (the point where they call the parent), lying about his behavior and anything else he doesn't want to do, and crying at the drop of a hat for tiny reasons that he had been able to handle since i returned from my last trip.his current behavior began about the same time i told him i had to take another short 10 trip.i know what the probable trigger is for his behavior.    my question is has anyone else gone through something similar and how did you handle it?    i've tried talking and spending extra time but that makes small differences at home but doesn't seem to change his behavior at school.
1426,hi. so i was with my boyfriend yesterday and we started fooling around. after a while, he accidently ejaculated on my panties, and i didn't realize until much later. he says it was precum, but is there a possibility i can get pregnant?
1427,hello. i've been having problems with my period, in the past 3 weeks. i've been bleeding constantly for more than 20 days now. i've been to see a doctor and she said that it's a hormonal problem and she prescribed me utovlan 5mg, to take them 3 times a day for 10 days. i've been taking them for 3 days now but the bleeding didn't stop. does anyone knows why is that happening or how many days does it need for the bleeding to stop? i'm concerned since the doctor told me that the bleeding should stop after a day. thanks for your answers in advance.
1428,i have a 15 yr. old step daughter who is lying to her dad about boys.    she is extremely different when she is with us than and mom.    what can we do?    we have tried to communicate with her mom but she does not respond.    she has boyfriends that we had no idea about.    her mom blames us because she is afraid.    we will accept lying.?    hat can we do?    she is avoiding us right now.    -mary
1429,i do not wear eyeliner nor do i wear contact lens but my eyes are watery and constantly run.    i do wear glasses and i am on the computer daily for most of the day for my job.     according to an eye doctor i saw in december i was told that i have dry eyes and to use an eye drop twice a day.    this would reduce the watery eyes and the constantly eye running.    i have been using the drops faithfully and my eyes don't run as much but i notice when i miss using the drops for a few days they will begin to run.    a few weeks ago i noticed something in my eye that appeared to look like a circle.    a few days ago i noticed the circle had turned into a bubble.    i am not certain what this means but it appears to be some type of infection that needs to be looked at by an eye doctor.    what are your suggestions?     i am most concern about my health.    i would greatly appreciate a response to my question as soon as possible.

1433,ok i had a tooth on my bottom left next to my k9 tooth that was broken and had a cavity in it and was causing me pain for about two days and then my lip and gums went numb. i went to the hospital and they gave me an antibiotic and a shot of novicaine. that i believe was a friday and then that monday i went to get the tooth pulled. it has now been well over a week and the numbness in that same spot is still there and feels like i have cotton or something in my gum. i have finished my antibiotic so i don't understand what is going on. will the feeling ever come back, i have been told numerous times that it could be from nerve damage? what does this mean?

1436,i'm on my 6th day of hcg injections and the vlcd....i started getting a cold 2 days ago, and i haven't been sick in nearly 5 years..just wondering if anyone else has ever had lessened immunity on the shots???    i've been resting and trying to follow the diet, but i have been constantly hungry today!!!    i'm very disappointed...i've been waiting a month to start this protocol in the hopes of it curbing my appetite...i want my energy back too..maybe i just need some support
1437,every couple of days or weeks, and if i'm lucky months, i will get a burning sensation on my right side and feels like it's under my ribs. it's very painful, to the point i can't get comfortable, i can't sleep, and it has reduced me to immobility and tears. last night it woke me up and lasted for about 5 hours and it extended to my back side of the ribs for the first time. on a scale of 1-10 my pain was 20. i tried cold packs, hot packs, ice water, going to the bathroom, and nothing worked. pain medicine makes it flare up even worse, especially ibuprofen. what does this mean? or is it something that can't be fixed?
1438,my husband and i are both wanting to start a family. the problem is that when i was in high school i had really heavy and irregular periods up until college when i had a period that lasted over 3 months. i went to the doctor, and he put me on birth control pills. i was on the pill for several years and this january we decided to finally go off and hope to start a family. we both know that it can take several months for my system to work itself out before i might be able to get pregnant. at first my periods were really light and and some months almost nonexsistent. now, however, it seems like my body is going back to they way it was in college. my periods have gotten heavier, and now it seems like it wont stop. how am i suppose to get pregnant when i won't stop bleeding? also, it seems like every time things settle down enough where we think, 'maybe this is the month' i start bleeding/having my period shortly after sex. has anyone ever gone through anything like this or know someone who did? what worked for you/them?
1439,doctor hi...!id like to ask u about something s really worries me..during the sleep sometimes i feel this terrible burning feeling at my nipple...is that indicates something serious?am i ok?thanks..

1441,hi. i'm not sure if its reason for concern. i have recently been tested and nothing came up. but i have a large amount of discharge normally, this is regular for me. but with it i sometimes get raw skin on my outer labia. it looks like its just been rubbed raw. there is a small amount of itching, but it's appears to be the same thing that happens when i have waayyy too much sex, and it rubs raw. so i do believe it is not an sti, as i again have been tested. but i am curious if it could be caused do to too much vaginal discharge. or if its just from thee labia rubbing together... i also think it could be caused by my underwear? sometimes i do wear tight panties that rub a little. im just curious of what can cause it, and how i can go about preventing it. could baby powder help? thank you!!

1443,i had successful surgery for a meningioma on the optic nerve. dr. said in 6 months i would have been blind in both eyes, had he not operated. the vision in left eye was left damaged and i am now having almost constant pain in the left eye. could this be from nerve damage or inflamation(inflammation), or what?
1444,my mouth is dry, so much so that it feels like my tounge sticks to the top of my mouth. it's not so unbareable but it's annoying. i have to drink constantly in order not to feel this sensation, going through 3 litres of water a day at least/ my room is surrounded with bottles and i don't think it's normal for someone to feel that they need to drink so much.
1445,my child is a 5 year old boy who started kindergarten this year.    so far he has gotten naked, touched another kid inappropriately, gets up out of his seat in class, stacks markers, chews with his mouth open, does not put away a crayon before getting another crayon out, etc.    everyday it seems like it is something different.    i have caught the teacher in a lie once about my child and now i am wondering if she is lieing about the other stuff also or just blowing things out of proportion.    is this just typical 5 year old behavior.    i have had him tested for all sorts of disorders and no one seems to want to say anything is wrong with him but his teacher insist that there is.    what should i do?
1446,i've had this recurring problem for over 20 years, when i got a glass chip in my eye.    chip was flushed out but never found.    since, i have occasionally woken in the middle of the night searing pain in my eye and tears streaming.    this only happened occasionally, but now happens every night if i don't put ointment in my eye.triggers seemed to be smoky atmospheres, dehydration (flared up in high altitude).    i've been treated on occasion for infections due to my eye being open, but after several doctors, the conclusion is that i have scarring on my cornea and should get my eye treated by using an older procedure to reshape the surface.could the chip still be lodged in the eyelid?    if i scarred last time my cornea was disturbed, don't i really run a risk this time?thanks!
1447,my husband is addicted to porn, we hardly have sex anymore.    we are swingers but on the condition our sex life doesn't change at home. he has given up having sex with me so i stopped our play time with others. i confronted him about the hours of masterbation(masturbation)and porn, minimal 3 hrs in bed every morning in front of me asked to join or help but told no. throughout the day looking at porn. its been weeks since we had sex and when we did he couldn't get hard. asked him what's wrong he said he thinks my body is disgusting.    i weight 130 lb work out three days a week. i don't know what to do. told him we shouldn't be together anymore, he said he loves me and doesn't want to get divorced. now i don't want to have sex with him because of how he feels about my body. any advice?

1451,hi my mum suffers from amd. since 2006 she has been troubled with seeing two large black 'circles' when she opens her eyes upon waking in a morning. these are not ordinary 'floaters', she says they are the size of a 2 pence piece. she only experiences these whilst laying down, and now says that she gets them after having been in bed only a short while (ie, before she has actually fallen asleep and woken up). if she opens her eyes they are sometimes grey and far away, sometimes they become 'closer' and darker. once she has opened her eyes and is aware of them, and then shuts her eyes the circles appear white.sometimes she says she experiences a kind of 'shutter ' sensation like a camera. i know my description may not be perfect but can anyone help diagnose what is wrong with my mum? she has been to the optician, who says it isnt an opthalmic problem because if she shuts one eye she can still see the circles. she has been to see a specialist at her gp's referral who also does not know what is wrong with her. please help?
1452,hi!i am new here, but have a question. i have been trying to conceive for the past 4 months, unsuccessfully! this month, i did the home ovulation tests. i was ovulating on the 12th or 13th. so of course, we tried our hardest! then, on the 20th i started having a pinkish/browinsh discharge. that lasted two days. i am not due to start my period until the 28th. i took a pregnancy test on sunday, the 22nd, but it was negative. could i still be pregnant? or is it probably just related to my upcoming period? thanks!

1459,my son (7 years) has been not quite himself for the past year. he has been doing spaz out behavior more often, bugging his sisters non stop and recently has confided in me that he has these bad thoughts in his head and can't control them. i.e- to say a bad word, to tell someone they are stupid and or swear. it seems to really bother him- as you could imagine. he seems to forget/not have them if he's having a lot of fun, exercising, etc. i told him to tell me everytime he does it, it seems to make him feel better. i think i need to get him to a therapist next week. what kind of specializations should i look for and should i ask him if he wants to see a male or female therapist. i have anxiety issues, have had panic attacks and am on zoloft for a few years now- so i know where he is getting it :( what can i say to him to help more? his teacher also had said he had trouble listening/follwing directions in school and she even wondered if he had a hearing problem- he had a hearing test at school & it was fine? any advice would be nice.

1465,good evening to all, i am having some vision problems issues and cannot get the proper correction from my glasses. my right eye is around 20/40 corrected with some distortion from a detached retina in 4/10; cataract removed and replaced with a toric lens and a macular membrane peel in 12/10.        my left eye is about 20/25 corrected with three retinal tears fixed with the laser and a small cataract. each eye tested independently is really not that bad, but getting both eyes to work together seems to be the big problem. i am experiencing a lot of cloudiness and blurred vision particularly during the day and at distances. my reading vision is not as bad. i am being followed by an outstanding retinal surgeon and was told at my last visit two weeks everything looked fine with my retinas. i have had three different eyeglass prescriptions since june of this year. is there anything else that might be tried to improve my overall vision? i was considering a neuro- ophthalmologist. thank you for all of your help.
1466,exclusive: another taliban leader captured in pakistannewsweekby sami yousafzai and mark hosenballanother leader of the afghan taliban has been captured by authorities in pakistan working in partnership with u.s. intelligence officials. taliban sources in the region and a counterterrorism officials in washington have identified the detained insurgent leader as mullah abdul salam, described as the taliban movement's shadow governor of afghanistan's kunduz province.taliban sources told newsweek's sami yousafzai that salam was grabbed by pakistani security forces in the city of faisalabad about a week ago  close to the same time that pakistani forces, again with american support, captured the afghan taliban's no. 2 leader, mullah abdul ghani baradar, in karachi. the taliban sources said that mullah salam was arrested with three other militants.advertisementaccording to the taliban sources, at the time of his capture mullah salam was preparing to travel to meet mullah baradar. some sources suggested that the arrests of the two insurgent leaders might be linked, though this could not be confirmed in washington.mullah salam was one of the taliban's most effective commanders in northern afghanistan and therefore one of the men most wanted by u.s. and nato forces fighting there. salam's soldiers are reputed to have been particularly deadly in their attacks on german troops fighting in northern afghanistan.a u.s. counterterrorism official confirmed to newsweek that mullah salam had been captured. thanks to solid intelligence work and some courageous partners in pakistan, this hasn't been a good time for the leadership of the afghan taliban, said the official, who, like others cited in this story, asked for anonymity when discussing sensitive information. while these kinds of operations aren't the whole answer, you can't succeed against an enemy like this until you prove he can't win on the battlefield. taking out [the] top guys is part of that.both the afghan and pakistani branches of the taliban appear to have suffered significant leadership losses recently. mullah baradar's capture last week is regarded as a major breakthrough, although there are still questions about how much access u.s. officials will have to mullah baradar, who is being held by pakistan. a source close to pakistan's leadership indicated that mullah baradar is under the control of pakistan's interior ministry, and noted that pakistani authorities may not treat him gently.
1467,i am a twenty one year old girl and i am very worried about my bowels and pooing. sorry if this is a bit gross, im just hoping someone can give me some advice that doesnt involve a doctor (obvs if its needed then i will), if i can avoid it then it would be great. over the past 3 months i have been in a lot of pain during pooing. it feels like there is a heavy brick constantly pressing in my bum. i have ibs (which ive had for years), and in the past ive bleed hilst pooing, due to the vast amount i go during the day. but this feels different to what i am used to experiencing. i get awful stomach cramps before i need to go, that often make me feel as if i am going to pass out, and then i get a heavy aching pain in my backside during and after. i feel constantly tired and run down, it literally exhausts me as i have to spend so much time on the toilet. it takes me so long to go, as it feels horrendous trying to actually go, and i am sometimes stuck on the toilet for anything up to an hour. if i get up and just give up, i instantly feel like i need to go again and reside myself to the pain of pooing rather than giving up and experiencing the cramps. i have been anally examined before, and it is mortifying, if theres anything anyone can sugesst i would reallyapprieciate it, and i wont take offence if someone's advice is going to the doctors.thank youvery worried girl

1472,hey all, i am due to your sunny shores on aug 16th. i am really scared of bears. doesn't that make you laugh! i live in the country known for the world's deadliest reptiles, insects etc! when i was there last year, i slept through a bear raiding a dumpster in the campground i was in. lovely hero of my ex-b/f pretty much pooohed his pants all night. he was more afraid to tell me and of my reaction than the bear eating us both!anyway i was looking on the net just now to see how to defend myself in case one should happen to encounter me, and what to do to advise i am not on the menu, when i stumbled across this.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjave57yh-oit is really funny as well as educational.are you scared of bears? have you had any encounters with bears? i'd love to know! (facing my fears, will make me stronger...she says as a mantra to herself!)

1475,as long as i can remember sometimes when i bend forward ie in bath to turn taps-put on socks my bottom ribs on the left cross over-this hurts and i have to sit up slowly until they go back.    that area feels sore for a few days after.have mentioned it to a dr once but the only response i got was a laugh.went to chiropractor a few weeks ago as was getting sciatic pain in left leg she said i had a displaced pelvis -it is down a forward to right and up and back to left.could this be why ribs get crossed ? sciatic pain was cured in one visit.
1476,i recently noticed small bumps on my labia minora.    they're very tiny, and there's a larger area of them on the right side than the left.    the bumps look almost like swollen tastebuds that i've had on my tongue in the past and are the same color as the rest of my labia minora.    they're slightly itchy, and i'm stupid and decided to pop one of them - there was no pus, only blood.    does anyone have a clue as to what this is?    any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated...thanks.
1477,my 5 year old nephew has always had meltdowns but they are becoming daily. he is on the verge of being kicked out of school due to his behavior.    he kicks and hits the teachers and principal almost daily. these fits are brought on by nothing more than another child turning out the light at the end of the day, when he wanted to. all the other triggers are just as minimal. he also refuses at times to use the bathroom when it is obvious he has to go, and sometimes soils his pants. loud noises seem to bother him, he will cover his ears with his hands. he is very smart and his parents are loving and supportive, but at their wits end. they want to have him evaluated to see if he has a disorder or if he is just a brat they need to be tough with. most doctors just want to medicate him......what do you think?
1478,i'm a 16 year old female with diarrhea lasting over a week long now. is this something i should go to a doctor about? what are some possible diagnoses? any questions feel free to ask. thanks(:

1481,i was in a bicycle accident four weeks ago, i hit my lower jaw (large lac on the lh side of the front of my lower jaw) and broke three upper teeth (lh incisors and bicuspid),nasty lac on my upper lip. i had a plastics guy do a great job on my lip and chin lacs, saw an oral surgeon the next day. he did a full pano xray on me, which i saw. no fractures of the jaw, though he did see a tiny crack in the front of my jaw. my teeth aligned properly with my mouth closed. large bruise in the bottom of my mouth, which eventually drained into my neck and upper chest, and is mostly gone. had three root canals the next day, crown lengthening scheduled for 3/30, will get crowns eventually. no sensitivity of my lower teeth to cold or heat. i have an invisalign tray over my uppers with 3 fake teeth while i wait.issue: it feels like there's cord pulling on my lower jaw on the left side when i chew - not really pain, just tightness. it seems to be getting better, but i don't understand what i'm feeling. no tmj pain or lower tooth pain, uppers all feel fine. what is going on? did we miss a jaw fracture?

1485,my 4 year old son was recently diagnosed with odd back in august. they prescribed him with a low dose of rilalin. i only give it to him once a day. he is in preschool and for a while he was doing good i thought the medication was working, now    i don' t think it is working to well. do you think that he should have his dosage increased or the frequency the medicine is being administered. i have also worried that the medication might be making his behaivor worse. you want the best for your kids and i feel so bad for him, his behaivor only seems to be uncontrollable at school settings at home he is tameable. he has been wetting the bed more at night and at school during naptime, the teacher says he wakes up embarrased that he wet his self and refuses to let anyone change him. i don't know what to do for him, if i could have one wish it would    be for my son to have a good behaivor. please advisethis discussion is related to4 year old out of control???.
1486,is it possible for a clitoris to become swollen and almost black/dark purple and painful after having sex? he slipped and jammed his penis into my clitoris, which felt like my clitoris was being shoved up inside me. he also performed oral sex after that. i woke this am and the hood of my clitoris and my clitoris is swollen and almost black looking. my left inner labia also has a hard area, i think it's the gland women have there but it is hard and painful and pink.
1487,basically, it's like i'm in an arousal state, but i am not aroused. my clitoral glad is exposed and sore to the touch from clothing, and my labia are also swollen.    my vaginal opening is more red than pink.    i am not in any pain, but it's really uncomfortable.    any suggestions

1489,http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/11/16471991-russians-take-fresh-samples-from-antarcticas-hidden-lake-vostok?lite&ocid=msnhp&pos=4by alan boylerussian researchers say they have brought up fresh samples of clear ice from antarctica's lake vostok, a huge reservoir of freshwater more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) beneath the surface.    lake vostok could contain water and perhaps living organisms that have been sitting undisturbed in the deep dark for up to 20 million years. the drilling operation also could set a precedent for far more ambitious efforts to find life beneath the ice of the jovian moon europa or the saturnian moon enceladus.because of the potential for contamination, scientists have been taking extreme care at lake vostok, which is situated 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of the south pole. a year ago, the russian drilling team reached the lake and brought up water samples. some of the water was even served to vladimir putin, who was then russia's prime minister and is now the country's president. but it wasn't clear whether those samples were actually from the lake or from the glacier above the lake, the russian news service ria novosti reported.this year's drilling operation is aimed at bringing up samples that can be linked more definitively to the lake itself.the first core of transparent lake ice, 2 meters long, was obtained on jan. 10 at a depth of 3,406 meters, russia's arctic and antarctic research institute said in a statement. inside it was a vertical channel filled with white bubble-rich ice.    the institute said that drilling operations would be extended another 24 meters with the existing cables, and that new cables were being delivered to the vostok research station. the core samples were to be subjected to chemical and biological analysis.lake vostok is about 160 miles (250 kilometers) long and 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide, making it the largest of antarctica's nearly 400 subglacial lakes. last year's drilling operation drew up samples from a depth of 12,366 feet (2.34 miles, or 3,769 meters). in october, russian team members reported finding no native life within those samples. they said the only microbes they detected were traced to contaminants from the drilling oil.the lake could serve as a laboratory for studying what antarctica's climate and ecosystem was like millions of years ago. it may contain creatures unlike any that exist today. and as ambitious as all that sounds, the vostok operation is seen as a mere warmup for future sampling missions to europa, enceladus and perhaps other icy moons in the solar system.planetary scientists see ample evidence that liquid water exists on those worlds, miles beneath the icy surface, and astrobiologists have theorized that internal heat may provide enough energy for organisms living within those hidden oceans.
1490,my eight year old daughter has been waking up terrified for the past month.    it has always been out of a deep sleep about an hour after i put her down.    when she wakes, she runs around the house asking for 'help'.    when i ask her to describe what is happening, she says there are bright lines flashing around in her head.    her heart beats fast and it takes me at least a half an hour to calm her down, usually by flipping the tv on.    sometimes it happens more than once a night.    there is no concrete dream she can remember causing this, and often when she snaps out of things, she can't remember what happened or how she got into my bed.

1501,there can be other reasons -- and not the dirty one that you and me (we old people) think .... as bad    or abnormal ----- if you child touches you in a different way that you feel - there is something wrong with your upbringing.he, may have memories of the past .... i am not talking about re-incarnation ------that memory might be a reason why he wants to touch his mom --- let him --- in fact hug him give him all your love ...to take care of a child, sacrifice, etc. etc. is one thing - but to understand the child is completely something else!! what is wrong with you american parents??????this discussion is related to4 year old boy..can't stop touching mother.

1509,i've been experiencing some really irritating short-term memory loss problems (for myself as well as other people).    i am 35, female and trying to figure out why and how i can improve this.    ther are a few things i have considered...i was in an auto accident last year.    i was t-boned and the driver side airbag went off and pretty much saved my life.    i had whiplash and have experienced a little neck pain ever since, but the emergency responders said i was okay at the scene of the accident, had me turn my head a bunch of different ways, checked my response etc.    could this mess up my memory?    the reason i wonder if it is something else is because i have always been a little scatter-brained, but it has gotten noticably worse.    could this be hormonal?    i also have depression and take 50 mg of zoloft.    it makes me a little drowsy, but when i'm off it, i find it even harder to concentrate.    i've started taking brain and memory enhancement supplements.    these helped a little, but not a lot.    i checked out the brain games, crossword puzzles etc.    i feel a little more confident about stuff, but people will ask me to do somethinga nd a minute later i will already have forgotten to do it.    i do in fact feel very multi-tasked.    if there is a way to describe it, i am overly-multi-tasked on the job and my home life is also quite busy.    should i get tested for add?    am i starting the downward spiral into dementia and alzheimers? i'd like to sharpen my thought processes enough to wear its something more excusable.    like i said it is pretty annoying.    i forget and mix up dates, priorities, names, things i need to remember to do and buy.    i walk down the stairs to get something and have to walk back up them and backtrack just to remember what it was i went downstairs to get.    help!
1510,i had a little swelling in my right eyelid about a week ago, it also itched a little and was more dry than usual. i have never had that happen before, but it went away quickly. i am concerned because it seemed to have caused a large wrinkle on my eyelid that is now very noticable when my eyes are open and it doesn't match my left eyelid now. i'm only 24, so i really want to know if i can expect it to go away or is there anything i can do to help it go away? please help! thanks!
1511,well for those who dont know my story, in short i had a faint pos in march followed by bleeding drs telling me im not preg, say gyny said all is fine but didnt have full notes and no scan pics but made app for 6months or i could go bk if i felt i need to.do basically my periods have been late each month i think max was about 3 4 days, but always neg tests (think eyes were playing tricks thinking it could be pos). so this time i was due sept 26th making me 9 days late, and no signs of turning up. i done a test yesterday and it kinda looked v faint pos, so i thought here we go again, and waited til today. this one seems darker but still faint. i had a bleed on 14th thru til about 17th none 16th. i have had bleeding when i was preg before but that was when i knew i was, but what im a little confused on is, could the 14th of been a weird period and i got preg after that and thats why its faint (test says reads 25 mui 10 days after concep) or was that just an inbetween bleed and maybe this isnt a good pregnancy or something. i thought i was getting energy again, but now i get tired all of a sudden and need to sleep whereas before was just constant low energy. i know i should go gp but i went so much before i want to be sure this time i guess. can a digi test that says preg/not detect at 25 mui? the only reason why im thinking it could be pos this time is cos still no af.what should i do? any opinions or this happened to them? thanks again u guys :-)

1513,i had a perm crown put on six days ago and while i have no constant pain or shooting pains i am experiencing pain when i bite down on food. it's a dull pain and goes away immediatly when i stop chewing. i've been back to the dentist twice already to have the crown worked on to adjust the bite and i'm still having the exact same pain. my dentist seems a little confused when i tell her about the pain and gets a litte frustrated when i can't pinpoint the exact location of the pain under the tooth. she prodded with a metal instrument which didnt hurt or cause discomfort. she also told me to keep taking ibprofren in case it's a fluid build up.is this normal? is it a situation where the tooth needs to rest and adjust to my mouth? i've had a crown before but dont remember any pain afterwards.

1523,after i was injected triamcinolone acetonide in one chalazion in my upper eyelid a year and a half ago, infection spread to my lower eyelid and conjunctiva. since then i have been using several antibiotics with little help: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, monofloxacin, fusicid acid, chlortetracycline... also anti-inflamatory drugs like tobradex and fml which help reduce inflamation(inflammation)but not treat the cause.what worries me now is that inflamation(inflammation)has reached near the cornea, as an incomplete bluish ring. may this threaten the cornea? my vision is not normal and i have had watery eye for about half a year now.what treatment do you think will be best for this condition? ciclosporine after a steroid, another antibiotic?thankshttp://www.medhelp.org/user_photos/show/198934?personal_page_id=993857
1524,http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/21/7879772-satellites-doom-set-for-friday#c58247359no more plus or minus: nasa says its derelict upper atmosphere research satellite is definitely making its final fiery plunge to earth on friday.for two weeks, experts on orbital debris has been telling people that the 20-year-old, bus-sized spacecraft would soon fall through the atmosphere and drop about two dozen pieces of debris on earth    but until this morning, there was too much uncertainty to say exactly which day that would happen. in today's update, nasa says it will be sept. 23, u.s. time.the time reference does not mean that the satellite is expected to re-enter over the united states, the update said. it is simply a time reference. although it is still too early to predict the time and location of re-entry, predictions of the time period are becoming more refined.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------the six-ton satellite's orbit is limited to between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south, spanning the width of the world between northern canada and the tip of south america. in the past, nicholas johnson, the head of nasa's orbital debris program office, has estimated that the chances that any of the uars debris would hit anybody were 1 in 3,200    which translates into a 1-in-20 trillion risk for any particular person (you, for example, unless you're living in, say, finland ... in that case there's zero risk).now that the time frame for the fall has been refined, you could theoretically tweak those odds, as well as the likely fall zone, to match the satellite's orbital track for friday. but nasa's johnson won't take on that exercise.at that point, we don't compute odds, he told me today. the satellite will simply fall where it falls.from here on in, nasa and its partners at the u.s. strategic command will be issuing updates on the timing at 24 hours before the expected fall, t-minus-12 hours, t-minus-6 hours and t-minus-2 hours    and we'll be passing those predictions along. but even two hours before re-entry, experts won't be able to project exactly where the debris will end up.when uars' predicament first came to light a couple of weeks ago, johnson said the margin of error for the 500-mile (800-kilometer) fall zone would be somewhere around 6,000 miles, or a quarter of the way around the planet. the uncertainty arises because of a couple of factors: solar outbursts, like the ones we've been getting over the past few weeks, lead to a faster decay of orbits for low-flying spacecraft. also, the satellite is tumbling, which leads to unpredictable atmospheric-drag effects. because there's no fuel left for orbital maneuvering, no one has any control over uars' orbital course.most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere, but nasa estimates that about a half-ton's worth of fragments will survive re-entry and fall to earth. the computer models suggest that the biggest chunk would weigh about 300 pounds (150 kilograms), or as much as a refrigerator. anyone who happened to be in the vicinity of the debris fall would see bright streaks in the sky, much like the fireworks seen when pieces of russia's mir space station fell to earth in 2001.the most likely outcome is that the remnants of the uars satellite would fall into a desolate patch of ocean or an uninhabited stretch of land, far away from any witnesses or potential victims. throughout the entire 54 years of the space age, there has been no confirmed report of anybody in the world being injured or severely impacted by any re-entering debris, johnson noted two weeks ago.
1525,has anyone else had this problem?    for the past month, about two or three times, i've woken up in the middle of the night with the worst cramps of my life.    like i feel like i have to go to the emergency room.    then it happened this morning.    it feels like it's right around where my ovaries are, mostly on the left.    and i'm not due for my period for two more weeks.    i've been on the same birth control, seasonale, for a year, i'm not having any gi complaints, and i am fairly positive i'm not pregnant.    what the heck is going on?    if this happens again, i am calling my obgyn, but i thought i would just poke around here first.    thanks for any help.    i really appreciate it!

1527,http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/fl-gay-adoption-20100921,0,2842261.storytallahassee   if an appeals court reverses a south florida judge and rules that florida's ban on adoptions by gay couples is valid, the state's child welfare agency won't remove the two children at the center of the challenge, the head of the agency said monday.department of children & families secretary george sheldon said that even if the 3rd district court of appeal    or eventually the supreme court    rules that the adoption of two boys by martin gill, a gay man, should not have been allowed, the state won't move to remove the children from his home.those children appear to be safe, well-adjusted, sheldon said of removing the children. we're not in the business of doing that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------stay on top of the news: get breaking new alerts sent directly to your phone--------------------------------------------------------------------------------gill was allowed to adopt the children by miami-dade circuit court judge cindy lederman, who in allowing the adoption found the state's ban on gay people adopting children unconstitutional. that ruling came in late 2008 and the state appealed the ruling to the district appeals court, where a decision is yet to come down.sheldon made his remarks at a question-and-answer period with reporters after a luncheon address during a seminar on legal reporting at the state supreme court.sheldon also said that the appeals court has had the case for an awfully long time    and wondered what was taking so long. it's time for that case to be decided, he said.sheldon's remarks followed comments last week by gov. charlie crist about the state's appeal of lederman's ruling. crist, who has said he supports the right of gay people to adopt children, said he was reviewing whether the appeal should continue.but sheldon said the agency wants the case to go through the appeals process in an effort to get a final decision that would make it clear that judges statewide would be able to allow gay adoptions if the couple is qualified, leaving it up to judges on a case-by-case basis.sheldon said both sides in the case want finality. we need an appellate decision to say, 'this is the constitutional status of this,' he said.sheldon said the governor, despite comments that he was reviewing the case, intends to let it proceed. we need to allow this appeal to move forward and [crist] understands this, sheldon said.sheldon has noted in the past that he voted against the ban when he was in the legislature, and he said monday that adopting couples' sexuality should not come into the decision on whether they can adopt.gill is being represented by the american civil liberties union of florida. its executive director, howard simon, said last week that gill doesn't want the case dropped by the state because he also wants a ruling on the constitutionality of the law that is binding statewide.enter to win tickets to see the eagles live in concertcopyright   2010, south florida sun-sentinelrelated storiesfrom other south florida sourcesflorida child welfare agency won  t take gay man  s kids if court reverses...|miamiherald.typepad.comflorida child welfare agency won  t take gay man  s kids|miamiherald.comdcf chief advises crist not to drop gay adoption lawsuit|postonpolitics.come-mail    print    digg    twitter    facebook    stumbleupon     sharecomments (25)add / view comments | discussion faqlenylap at 4:54 pm september 21, 2010um1999 you can have kids if you want , nobody said you can't , but sorry with two men not gonna work to bake babiesum1999 at 4:27 pm september 21, 2010i think the comments on this site are almost as entertaining as some of things this paper calls journalism.    maybe we wouldnt have these issues if the heterosexual couples out there stopped having gay children in the first place.    instead of worrying about kids who need homes maybe we should be worrying about all the unfit people out there having kids to begin with.    lets just make sure we dont go half-a** on the gay adoption ban.    as long as i cant have children as a gay couple in florida maybe i should get an exemption on school taxes...makes perfect sense to me.    why should my hard earned money go to support schools in a state that says i cant have kids.lenylap at 4:21 pm september 21, 2010most kids want to have father and mother . if people chose to be gay or lesbians    it's there business but leave kids alone .

1530,i just recently had a natural miscarrage(miscarriage), about 4 days ago. i have been bleeding since then with alot of clots too. is this normal? i was just using a tampon, but it only lasted for about 30 minutes. i now am having to use a tampon and a pad at the same time to keep my clothes dry, and to keep it from running down my legs. i know to much info, but i am worried that something maybe wrong, don't know what to do about this. i am a broke college student that has no insurance so going to the doctor is out of the question, i can't pay for it and they wont take me. can anyone let me know if this is normal or if i just need to go to the er?
1531,aout six months ago i fell and knocked the side of my head hard on a rock.    for about 1 week after that i had a real tight sort of feeling like a lacky band was around my head, (just above my ear on the left side of my head) this pressure still comes and goes, and stays there for days., and i am wondering if there could be a problem, should i seek medical advice?
1532,about 2 minths ago i noticed what looked like a small red patch with a little outline of white around it. ringworm looking, at the tip of my tongue. it is still there. it moves around a little, but is always at the tip. sometimes it is a little more prominent than others, and i have obsessed myself with discovering what it could be. i have found the term geographic tongue and it seems to describe this. could this be what it is? it is mildly sore...like i burnt the end of my tongue with hot coffee. i even have a few small lines that have appeared on my tongue. like little slits. i am just curious if this meets the sescription of geographic tongue. i never noticed it there in my life til about 2-3 months ago. i have tried different types of gargle, and eating less spicy foods. i guess it helps to some degree, but is still there nonetheless. does this ever go away? is there any treatment or remedy? and does it sound like geographic tongue?this discussion is related todoes this sound like geographic tongue?.

1534,here's something fun to do. i did this once in a bible class. we figured out what our personality types were. it can help to show us our strengths and also our weaknesses so we can be more aware of them. it can also help us to understand others better once we figure out what their personality trait it.there are different personality tests out there that you can take. this is the one i did. it's 4 personality types;the four temperament typeseach of the four types of humours corresponded to a different personality type. some people are a combination of more than one. for example: mel-chlor, chlor-san, etc. with one personality trait tending to be more the dominant one.    see which one you are and post it here!sanguinethe sanguine temperament personality is fairly extroverted. people of a sanguine temperament tend to enjoy social gatherings and making new friends. they tend to be creative and often day dream. however, some alone time is crucial for those of this temperament. sanguine can also mean very sensitive, compassionate and thoughtful. sanguine personalities generally struggle with following tasks all the way through, are chronically late, and tend to be forgetful and sometimes a little sarcastic. often, when pursuing a new hobby, interest is lost quickly--when it ceases to be engaging or fun.cholerica person who is choleric is a doer. they have a lot of ambition, energy, and passion, and try to instill it in others. they can dominate people of other temperaments, especially phlegmatic types. many great charismatic military and political figures were cholerics.melancholica person who is a thoughtful ponderer has a melancholic disposition. often very kind and considerate, melancholics can be highly creative    as in poetry and art - and can become occupied with the tragedy and cruelty in the world. a melancholic is also often a perfectionist. they are often self-reliant and independent.phlegmaticphlegmatics tend to be self-content and kind. they can be very accepting and affectionate. they may be very receptive and shy and often prefer stability to uncertainty and change. they are very consistent, relaxed, rational, curious, and observant, making them good administrators and diplomats. unlike the sanguine personality, they may be more dependable.
1535,my ex and i initially separated when our daughter was 19 months old.    at that point in time, she acted out, throwing tantrums, etc.    it was very evident that her little world as she knew it was interrupted.    we were separated for 2 months.    she was ecstatic to having us live back together.    we lived together for another 10 months and have again separated as of last month.    she will be 3 in january and i am curious if it is possible that she could be depressed???she is acting withdrawn at daycare and really doesn't want to go to school.    yesterday her school called to find out if she had any medicine before school because she was very sleepy and not social in general.    her dad picked her up and brought her to his mom and she slept all day long.    this morning on the way to school and often a lot of other mornings, as we near the school, she says she doesn't want to go.    today when i called to check on her, they said she is going in and out.    sometimes she participates, laughs and smiles and sometimes she fades out and becomes droopy again.do children this age go into depression due to separation?    or is it a normal cycle of behavior?thanks,jennifer

1542,i don't really know what topic to post this under but...a while ago i was having sex and i think i might have torn my frenulum a bit? but i don't know ... either way is is healed i think now (this was about 2 months ago) but since then i have had strange feelings in my penis and just recently around it. sometimes i get these stinging pains in the end of my penis and recently it has looked as though the veins re swelling (not sure if this is me looking too much into it but it looks that way to me) , when i am erect it looks more swollen that what it used to and the head goes quite red and almost looks as though it's being stretched. jsut recently i have been getting a pulling kind of feeling in my lower stomach area? just above where my penis is ... and sometimes pain on the left and right side ... (though this could be something else?) i mean that last stuff could be pulled muscles or something? since i hadn't gone anywhere for a few days then went out and did a fair bit of walking? but either way it's still worrying me ... since i hurt my penis and it was bleeding 2 months ago (though it wasn't bleeding much) i have been wiping it with a tissue every time i urinate through fear of it infecting or something ... should i stop doing this? and can you help me understand what's wrong with me?i went to a doctor about 1 and a half months ago because i was getting red spots on the head of my penis everytime i ejaculated, he said that they were nothing and it would go away ... but i don't know if they have as i haven't had sex or masturbated since ... this is making my life very difficult as i'm always worrying about this ... just want to understand a bit more. i will be seeing a doctor on monday but i would really like some help?
1543,i woke up 3 weeks ago with a small ulceration on my right nipple. it had grown from 1 mm in diameter to 3 mm in diameter in a couple of days and appeared infected and a second ulceration appeared beside it, so i went to the doctor. the wound did weep yellow fluid after it would get wet. there was no discharge or itching, but my nipple was extremely sensitive. i had assumed it was because of the open wound. i took a weeks worth of keflex and she cultured the ulceration and ordered an ultrasound. everything came out normal. it has healed, but there was no conclusion for what had happened. my right nipple is enlarged and deformed. the areola skin is now dry and i feel a pain that comes and goes in my right breast.my doctor keeps telling me to watch it for a month to see if anything changes before she will refer me to a specialist. i am terrified this may be a sign of paget's disease of the nipple or dcis. would paget's have responded to antibiotics? what could be any possible reasons for this?i am not pregnant and do not have children. i am 23 years old and my last mens was 01/19/10.any answers or insight will give me some slight piece of mind. thank you in advance for your immediate reponse!
1544,i have a 5 year old son who is a wonderful, respectful and caring boy, 80% of the time. during the remaining 20% of the time, he is disrespectful, angry, moody, and yelling at my 13 year daughter and myself as much as possible. he turns red in the face. he punches. he puts his face right in mine and tries to bully me around. i remain as calm as possible. his behaviour starts whenever he doesn't get his way. my daughter never behaved this way, so it's very difficult for me to understand how to handle him, or how to react to his behaviour. i have no experience. every day we run into problems. i would appreciate help and advice because this situation has drained me emotionally and made me quite sad.
1545,i am thinking about getting labiaplasty. please give me some input on what you women think about it in general. it would really boost my confidence when i try to tell me doctor this when i go. it so embarassing...
1546,hi, i do not know if i am posting in the correct place, and if i am not, for that i am sorry. my wife has been experiancing a few different symptoms and they are only getting worse. i am in the army and she has been to doctors, but they never can seem to find out why. they only give her pills to cover all the symptoms. she cannot hold food down. on the occasion that she does, she ends up with the runs. she has been getting really bad headaches and they have been more and more frequent and painful. when she eats, regardless if she holds it down or not, she becomes really bloated. we thought for a while that the bloating might be from salt for some reason, because she went to the beach and became extremely bloated, but we are not sure why. she has complained of tightness of the chest, pain in her arm, and at random times either her arms, hands, feet, and legs would fall asleep. the other night she woke up with a lot of pain in her chest and said it was difficult to breathe. it only lasted for about 10 minutes. she has spoken to internal medicine, has had blood work, x-rays, ekg, and an mri. they do not yet know what is going on and i was hopeing that i might find someone who has come across these symptoms before and might have an idea of what it could be.if anyone knows, please help. i am very worried about my wife and i am deployed so i cannot even be there with her as she is going through all this.thank you for your time.

1551,okay, so i'm 15 and a virgin. a day or two before the incident(which i will include later), my boyfriend of 6 months fingered me. after he fingered me, i noticed some light bleeding usually with my discharge. we thought the bleeding could be from my cherry popping. before we started dating, me and my boyfriend agreed that we would not have sex at all. a couple days after he fingered me, i was still bleeding, and it was the day before my period. that same day me and my boyfriend were making out, and we got caught up in the mood. long story short, his penis ended up touching my vagina. it did not go in at all, we both decided it was a bad idea, we just made contact. my boyfriend had not cummed yet, and he said he wiped his penis in case of precum. the next day, i believe i started my period because the bleeding was heavy (which is usual for my period) and my period has been normal and has been occurring since wednesday and i'm writing this on saturday. i do take birth control to help regulate my period. can i be pregnant? is the blood from popping your cherry fertile? please help as soon as you read this (if you really know what you're talking about). i'm young and scared. i need    help.

1556,as u.s. postal service faces default, critics see manufactured crisis to speed up privatizationfor months, americans have heard dire warnings about the impending collapse of the united states postal service due to fiscal insolvency. as republicans push to privatize the post office, the agency is now bracing for its first-ever default today. unlike every other governmental agency, the postal service is required to fund 75 years of retiree health benefits over just a 10-year span. we discuss the fight over the postal service with democratic rep. dennis kucinich of ohio and chuck zlatkin of the new york metro area postal union. the american people have to wake up here about what  s happening with the postal service, kucinich says. the whole concept of the postal service, embedded in that is the idea of universal service, that if you  re poor, you live in a rural area, you  re going to get served just like someone who lives in a city and who may be wealthy.( video and transcript)http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/1/as_us_postal_service_faces_default

1564,my son turned 4 in july and is now attending pre-school.    he is very bright, is starting to read, knows colors, shapes, etc and has for some time.    he is an only child and has been with a sitter and one other child until now.    other than playing on a t-ball team he has never been with several children at once in a structured environment.    he started pre-school last year, but refused to use the rest room in the classroom and was not allowed to use the one across the hall that he would use. during this time another child that was older than he was repeatedly poked him until he finally got into a fight. he won this fight and from that time on he started choosing to shove, hit and yell at others when he was frustrated.    before this time he never displayed these behaviors.    we pulled him out of pre-school when his behavior at school and at home continued to get worse.    we felt he just was not ready to go to school since he was so young.    this year he is at another pre-school, but on the first day started pushing, shoving and yelling at both adults and children when he was stressed by a new social situation.    the school feels he needs to be tested for delayed language skills. they feel he may not have the ability to properly express his emotions by talking and is having the other behaviors instead. they also feel he may be adhd.    i have no problem having him tested if i can find the appropriate place to give him a proper evaluation, but i feel that his lack of interaction with other children of his age is the main problem. he has not learned how to deal with the unique social situations that a classroom of 15 children being told to sit, stand in line, share, etc. presents to him.    last night we practiced appropriate behaviors by role playing several situations that would usually cause him to become upset.    he did improve a great deal, but i don  t know if he can transfer this to the children.    i want him to stay in school and have offered to hire an aid to help with him for as long as it takes to see improvement.    what do you think?    what can we do for him?

1575,if you have never been in a state mental institution let me tell what to expect from my nightmares.what brought you here asked one attendant?tell them anything cause they will ask you over and over and over.7 times i told my story about being slipped a mickey.can i leave? ................wait..............wait............wait.............here take this (pill)now here is where you have reached a cross road if you take it you are compliant and will suffer from its effects if you do not and say no that is an act of defiance and you will be considered a threat or hostile. so you are faced with comitment or a week of observation renewable by a judge. if you were not diagnosed with a serious mental illness before you are now and the nurses and bouncers (security) will be in to administer your medicine.hours may go by before you notice the affects of the drug if you never had it before. soon your tongue will start to swell in your throat your neck will twist as you choke into unconciousness a seizure will start usually a gran mall seizure.when the nurse gets off their *** they will shoot you with cogentin a anti-parkinsonian drug to stop the side effect.you are now ready to be treated. this horrified young    person i was at that time met shortly with the doctor and was asked some tripped up questions.i have replayed it in my sleep over and over for 35 years now.this reaction caused the chemical imbalance you now have...............it is irreversible......................................and you may be informed you will be on medicines the rest of your life.with all that in mind you are faced with a violation of human rights known only to the psychiatric wards all over the world.if you have not already been it is usually first all your belongings are taken away the longer your stay the less likely you will ever see that stuff again they are vaued and you are given some papers to explain you (lack of) rights.you may or not be told what you are being treated for either major depression, skitzophrenia, or manic depression for a long time but which style of drugs may ellude to that via your new menu of treatment options.the rest of the treatment consists of neglect and imature groups that just talk or make noise, art therapy is your treat and your appearancewill change from weight gain or involutary muscle movements.(twitching)every mannerism you ever had is evaulated and diagnosedyou are being broken downif depression did not start yet you will be evaluated for it.your life is now under the desisions of doctors and judges social workers and advocates.they come and go like water over a dam, often escorted by a herd of patients wanting their attention.if you can focus on what to say during your weekly five minute doctor visit he will increase or decrease your medicines and offer you other ones.now with this awful fear of dying it seems like the best option sometime and i envy those who had the guts to    take their own life. selfish or not permanant or not their is no recourse there is no justice you are disabled a now in poverty on federal welfare known as social security or suppliment isurance and the hospital may be the best place you will be in.money is your only advocate and on drugs you cant make any.welcome to my nightmarefred

1578,my mother in law (75) has coughing fits several times a day.    she's been checked by a dr. and it is nothing to do with her health.    several dentists have said that because she does not take her dentures out at night and does not rinse them throughout the day it is causing the coughing.    we are looking for someone to confirm this and if there is any information on line about this.    she has some short term memory issues so if i can get it in writing for her maybe she will believe us when we tell her to rinse her mouth out and that her dentures need to come out at night!
1579,i know we all known someone or people who have been in an abusive relationship? therefore, i know someone can give me answers to my dilemma of my life. my husband and i have been married an year and four months now. the marriage has not been the greatest--actually the worse (with a few moments of happiness). i know marriage is hard work and no its not a walk in the park. but, when you are trying and the other person is not? yes, it makes it very hard!well, he is very emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive. i asked for counseling many times, sat down to talk to him about his behavior--he blows up of course. with hold sex--flat says no or says he is not in the mood--way before my hysterectomy nov. 16,2011. cussing, throws things, breaks my things, nit picks with me, tries to make me upset--especially when i keep the peace. then when i do defend myself in an argument or one of his backlashes? he says: don't raise your voice or get loud? but, i'm getting talked to like a dog...smh! he has never hit me. but, what he is doing enough to feel like he has. now, he has a good side: nice, helpful, great provider, cooks, cleans, and works hard. but, its like little petty things can easily set him off!for examples: people on his job, anyone in the household, or he is just having a flat out bad day? he keeps apologizing over and over and over again! i've been tired a long time ago--tired of handing him out chance after chance. he becomes nice for a few days to a week or week and a half. then bam! it happens again! i'm just tired of the same ole' lines: i'm sorry line. i'm going to change line. i'm going to do better line. i'm going to treat you better line and nothing has taken place! i try to stay hopeful and prayerful for a change. i really wanna a divorce. but, on the other hand i always try to see things to the end. but, my heart and head hurts.i'm a woman who does not nag--seriously i don't, i don't get an attitude--unless needed and sticking up for my self. i try to encourage, love, and motivative him. and this is what i get from him? ugh! i'm so stressed and confused! is it really love on his end? like he tells me or what? we just had an very nasty blow out a few days ago--mind you i'm still having health issues and this stress was/is not helping. he apologized as usual and he agreed to counseling--we'll see about that. i'm glad he agreed at least? someone help me understand and give me some sound advice! thanks in advice!

1581,eight days ago i started having white flashes and floaters appear in my right eye which my dr. said are from a (painless) migraine of the eye.    my vision is blurry like i'm looking through murky water and the floaters are long squiggly lines.    i understand that floaters take a long time to settle down.    i don't mind the floaters as much as the blurred vision.    has anyone had this type of migraine and do you know what triggered it?    my dr. said i probably won't have this problem in my left eye but how does he know that?    i would be legally blind if it happens to my other eye.
1582,my last period was 12th april with pregnancy test being neg (even the test dr did was neg) but since june i have had now 6 bleed after peeing one of them being a cloti seem to notice that anytime i have had this bleed it has been when i ate something like fried egg or mayo or foods like that is just a coincidence? or is this food the reason why i have been having bleeds?i am not on any new medicine or bctoday i bleed wheni was out shopping and guess what i ate chicken mayo started to think there is a pattern here could there be?
1583,i've been with my boyfriend for a year now. for the first seven months he was on probation (for hard drugs, which he no longer uses) when we met so he was forced to be sober.now that he's no longer on probation he has started smoking pot multiple times every day. he can't simply enjoy any activity without being high. that being said, i have absolutely no issue with the occasional recreational use of marijuana. i've smoked with him and would not care if he was only getting high every few days. i do have an issue when someone i care about considers pot to be their main priority in life.i care about him a lot and i hate knowing what our relationship was like before he began relying on pot to get him through the day. it seems like that person i got into a relationship with has changed.he's reluctant to go to couples counseling to help us come to some kind of an agreement (and other more normal communications issues which i think could be very easily remedied) he's gone to counseling before (by himself) and hated itso, honestly: do you think someone with an addictive background can ever just slow down on something? if i continue to allow him to smoke is he always going to struggle with overuse of the drug?i think the hardest part is knowing that he gave up hard drugs. i know he's able to quit certain things. he just doesn't view smoking non stop as destructive. he is willing to go to the library with me to get books about communication etc and try to work on things ourselves, but i don't know if that is any kind of a substitute for an unbiased therapist giving us advice on our specific problems.
1584,whenever i get fillings the fillings never feel completely smooth on my tooth. almost like there's a little ridge between the filling and my tooth. food gets caught there and now i have 3 definite cavities next to fillings. two i can put off until i get to marine bootcamp in three months where dental care will be free(woohoo!) but the one feels tender when i clean it out and i'm sure will be deep enough to require a root canal by that time if it doesn't already. based on the horror stories of root canals at bootcamp i really don't want to have to do it there. so is my dentist wrong in not making sure the filling is completely smooth on my tooth? he has been seeing me for a few years now and knows what weak enamel i have.also could veneers help someone like me who has really weak enamel?
1585,republicans thwart watered down democrat plans to tackle offshore oil risks and boost green jobsbusinessgreen.com staff, businessgreen, 04 aug 2010senate majority leader harry reid was yesterday forced to admit defeat in his attempt to pass any form of us energy bill ahead of congress' summer recess, despite repeated moves to win over republican opponents by watering down the controversial legislation.speaking at a press conference yesterday, reid said that a vote on the proposed bill scheduled for this week would be delayed until september after the democrats failed to secure the 60 votes necessary to pass the legislation.reid laid the blame for the decision firmly at the feet of republican senators who refused to support the bill, despite the democrat's controversial decision to drop those parts of the bill that would have imposed caps on carbon emissions and set targets for renewable energy generation.the final version of the bill instead focused on tackling risks associated with offshore oil drilling in the wake of the bp pill in the gulf of mexico. it would have strengthened safety rules and removed the $75m cap on damages currently enjoyed by offshore oil companies in the event of a spill.the bill also retained some elements from the original climate bill, including measures designed to improve domestic energy efficiency, accelerate the rollout of cleaner natural gas powered trucks, and boost green job creation programmes.however, republican senators maintained their opposition to the bill, while at least two democrat senators from the oil-rich states of louisiana and alaska also signalled that they would vote against the watered down bill.we tried ju-jitsu, we tried yoga. we tried everything we can with republicans to get them to come along with us and be reasonable, reid said.  it's a sad day when you can't find a handful of republicans to support a bill that would create up to 700,000 clean energy jobs, hold bp accountable, and look at a future as it relates to what bp did.republican senators maintained that removing the cap on spill liabilities would stop oil firms from investing in the gulf of mexico, effectively making the us more dependent on imported oil.however, democrat senator john kerry, who led the development of the draft bill, slammed republican leaders for refusing to support a bill that already contained numerous concessions.ask anyone outside of washington, and they  ll tell you that this isn  t a democrat or a republican issue, it's an american issue, he said. it's american troops whose lives are endangered because we're dependent on oil companies in countries that hate us. it's american consumers who are tired not just of prices at the pump that soar each summer, but sick and tired of our oil dependency that makes iran $100m richer every day that washington fails to respond.the move is the third major defeat for the democrat's climate change agenda within the last two weeks, after reid was forced to abandon both the plan for an emissions trading scheme and more modest proposals for a renewable energy standard that would have required energy firms to generate a proportion of their energy from renewable sources.the climbdown has represented a major blow to the authority of president obama and has significantly weakened the us position at international climate change talks taking place in bonn, germany this week.however, reid insisted that he was confident the an energy bill could still pass in september ahead of the mid-term elections in november.several key republicans have said they need more time to consider a bill and its merits, reid said. i accept that in good faith. we're giving them that chance, hope it will lead to a reasonable discussion and their support.the house of representatives last week passed a similar bill that would have restricted the leasing of offshore oil drilling rights to companies with a good safety record.us officials have also said that the administration will honour its international commitment to cut carbon emissions 17 per cent against 2005 levels by 2020, despite its failure to codify the target in law.http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2267599/senate-blocks-energy-bill-yet

1588,hi, for about a week now ive been suffering from lower back ache...its a dull ache across my lower back and comes and goes. i also have been getting more infrequent stomach cramps, im wondering if there might be a link? my doctor did a test of my urine and there is no sort of urinary infection..but i really cant tell if the two symptoms are linked or serperate? i am due to start my period in about a week so i was wondering if perhaps that had something to do with it...other than that i cant think of any explanation for the stomach cramp other than that i was quite constipated about a week ago..which caused stomach pain...but i took something which you disolve in water to relieve constipation and it seems to be ok now. in terms of the back pain, i do exercise frequently but havnt really been doing anything different..and i do stand up alot at work and wear quite flat shoes...so perhaps this could be causing my back pain? as you can see im quite confused..and my symptoms are quite vague so my doctor suspected it was some kind of muscle strain after checking all my movement, which was fine and just told me to take pain killers..but im wondering if you could be able to see something else? thanks i would really appreciate a second opinion..and sorry for the long comment!

1590,my 7 year old daughter is either good as gold or her evil twin.    she can be the sweetest thing on earth.    helping everyone.    concerned and very caring.    the next minute i swear she turns into the evil child. during these moments she is belligerent and extremely rude to me,    her mom. she will scream at the top of her lungs when she does not get her own way.    she will say some very hurtful things at me during these times,.    ex: you don't love me and you love alex (her brother ) way more. sometimes i just want to die.    i'll kill myself, i want to kill myself. this whole family hates me.    no body listens to me.    you all want me gone and then on and on about wanting to be dead and wanting to just die.at first i didn't worry to much and thought it would pass but it is not going away. (1 year later). i feel she truly believes that i love her brother more and is she thinks she wants to die at that very moment.    now i do not love her brother more and am very careful to share equal emotion and time with both. her brother is 2 years older than her.    my question to you is how to deal with the situation when it arises.    she is very out of control at these times and hard to get close to.     i don't know what to do anymore.     is there someway for me to try and help her out. or should i get her in to see a counselor.please can you give me any suggestions.     her family is in tack and there is no major marital discord in our family.    just your normal middle class family i guess.regards, lb

1597,i think this is interesting. misleading and false statements made by various guests on various television news programs over the weekend. various subjects. factcheck.org reveals the truth and points out the lies.sunday replayjuly 5, 2010bookmark and sharepoliticians didn  t take a holiday from false and misleading statements on july 4. we found misstatements on the sunday talk shows that touched on afghanistan, michael steele and immigration.a firm date for    what exactly?on abc  s this week, republican sen. john mccain of arizona made it sound as though president obama would pull all troops out of afghanistan in july 2011, regardless of what happens in the country. but the president never promised that all troops, or even a certain number, would be withdrawn. instead, in announcing his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to afghanistan, obama said he would begin the transfer in july 2011, taking into account conditions on the ground.mccain: but what i worry about more than anything else is the    the july of 2011 firm date, which the president has not    certainly has not been positive as far as our commitment is concerned. in other words, we need a conditions-based situation, not a date for withdrawal.   but the fact is that, if you say that you are setting a date certain for leaving as his key advisers have, including, i think, one on your show that said that we were    that it is a, quote, firm date, his spokesperson said it  s, quote, etched in stone and he has the chisel, and other statements by his civilian advisers have undermined the belief that we will have a conditions-based withdrawal.mccain does accurately describe the words of white house press secretary robert gibbs, who told cbs news chief white house correspondent chip reid in december 2009 that the july 2011 date was, in reid  s words, etched in stone and that troops would start coming home then.here  s what obama said in december 2009:obama, december 2009: but taken together, these additional american and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of afghanistan in july of 2011. just as we have done in iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. we  ll continue to advise and assist afghanistan  s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. but it will be clear to the afghan government    and, more importantly, to the afghan people    that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.more recently, on june 24, obama reiterated that: we did not say that starting july 2011, suddenly there would be no troops from the united states or allied countries in afghanistan. we didn  t say we  d be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us. what we said is we  d begin a transition phase in which the afghan government is taking on more and more responsibility.more dubious deadline claimson cbs     face the nation,   republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina repeated a false statement he made last week on fox news sunday. graham claimed that white house chief of staff rahm emanuel had said july 2011 was a firm date of withdrawal from afghanistan. emanuel wasn  t that definitive.graham: the problem is, you  ve had rahm emanuel, you  ve had david axelrod, and other people saying that july 2011 is a firm date of withdrawal.emanuel actually said on abc  s this week on june 20 that the firm date is one that deals with the troops that are part of the surge, the additional 30,000. what will be determined at that date or going into that date will be the scale and scope of that reduction. emanuel didn  t say that all troops, or even a significant number, would be withdrawn on that date. he said the number coming home would be based on the conditions on the ground.  as for white house senior advisor david axelrod, he said on meet the press on june 13 that the white house   is committed to begin that process of withdrawal in july of next year, and that continues to be the plan, and we  re going to pursue that on that schedule.  steele  s retraction?both sens. joseph lieberman and lindsey graham said that republican national committee chairman michael steele had retracted his controversial comments about the war in afghanistan, which steele called a war of obama  s choosing. steele did clarify his remarks, but he didn  t apologize. we  ll leave it to readers to decide whether his response could be called a retraction.graham said on   face the nation   that he is   glad to see that michael steele is retracting his statement because it  s not the republican party  s position, my republican party position.   meanwhile, lieberman, an independent from connecticut, said on fox news sunday   that steele had retracted his comments.here  s what steele originally said at a july 1 fundraiser in connecticut:steele july 1: keep in mind, again, our federal candidates, this was a war of obama  s choosing. this is not, this is not something the united states had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in.   [i]f he  s such a student of history, has he not understood that, you know, that  s the one thing you don  t do is engage in a land war in afghanistan? all right? because everyone who has tried over a thousand years of history has failed.    there are other ways that we can engage in afghanistan without committing more troops.   steele then encouraged candidates running for office to make use of a whole text of resources available through the rnc and republican congressional committees that help frame those arguments.republicans were quick to condemn steele  s remarks, and the following day steele released an official statement clarifying his stance on the war. he emphasized the necessity of winning in afghanistan as well as his support for the troops and general petraeus   confirmation. but he didn  t disavow his original remarks.steele, july 2: during the 2008 presidential campaign, barack obama made clear his belief that we should not fight in iraq, but instead concentrate on afghanistan. now, as president, he has indeed shifted his focus to this region. that means this is his strategy. and, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.as we have learned throughout history, winning a war in afghanistan is a difficult task. we must also remember that after the tragedy of september 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one. that is why i supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire united states senate, i support general petraeus   confirmation. the stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in afghanistan.
1598,i had sex last month and he ejaculated in me but the next day i had period so i thought no big deal. well i was supposed to have my period on december 19th and didnt so i took a pregnancy test 3 days later and came out negative well now its january 2nd and i havent gotten my period... is there a posibility that im pregnant..?
1599,i had surgery on my breast twice for the removal of breast cysts.    the second surgery was the most painful.    i still have the incesion and someitmes it will reoccur but there is always a small opening and last night something burst and my nightgown had blood on it.    i guess it was another cyst but i did not hurt this time.    what can be causing them to come back
1600,i hope someone can help.....for the past 3 or 4 days i have had heavy discharge that began with me bleeding for about a day then turned orange and has stayed that way and had a fowl odor to it. does anyone know what this could be and what i should do???
1601,i stopped smoking hemp 2 years ago and i cant still fight my inner yellow tooth,i need it to white and i have tried even herbs.some one should pls advice me on that....
1602,i was advised by my dentist to do a briadge according to missing tooth. two teeths arround missing one didnt bother me but had fillings . after procedure was performed my teeth become cold sensative and    it was hard to drink something even a little bit colder then the mouth temperature or even brush my teeth with a tooth paste.after i visited my doctor and explained him a problem he    reffered me to a gum grafting specialist, but another doctor refused to performe any gum procedure and sent me back to my dentist with advice eighter to replace    the briadge or try    to put the filling alonge the gum area( which wasnt covered deep enough by crown as he explained). my dentist didnt replace but tried to cover the aria by gum,but it wasnt helpfull    enough. ..after going back and force to his office with the same problem for another three months    he finally agreed on making a new briadge,but after numbing the area with more then 10 injections he drilled sooooo much the hard tissue of already decreased in size( with previouse drilling)    tooth so it caused the nerve of the tooth to become damaged to the point that it needed root canel treatment.second crown preparation procedure was simply the last straw to the life of my tooth..i was so depressed, because my tooth never gave me any problem before i start all the procedures for briadge..the worsest is now ,when he make me pay the root canel $$$$ after i have already paid him 35 grands for the briadge and another tooth under the new briadge he made become also cold sensitive and painfull so i would probably need another tooth treatment for root canel to be done also..can u please advice me what the legal step i can make and do i even have a rights to disscuss with him the money issue after all the phisical and emotional demage he did to me. he is very mean and rude the way he talks to people and has very low tolarance to people pain and problems.

1604,during orgasm, i seem to ejaculate very little. my sperm seems to be quite thick and tends to come out slowly. i regularly drink fluids so i assumed that dehydration was not an issue. i have also lost no weight or muscle over the past 12 months. however i do suffer from anxiety and panic attacks quite often, what could be the cause of my problem with ejaculation?i am 16 years of age, 119 pounds.
1605,i was diagnosed with high risk hpv 10 years ago and at the time i was pregnant. i think it must be the real bad strand because i am having problems with it again. i am concerned that i may have passed it to my daughter durring the birthing process. what if anything can i do? is there a test i can have done for her?
1606,today i had sex with my fiance,, and during it was wonderful and all but afterwords i got horrible pain in my vaginal area not like you just lost it pain but like i was getting punched in the stomach numerous times.it hurt to walk it was like atrocious cramps..
1607,i'm 35.    a year ago i had a blood test for thyroid.    my thyroid was fine, so my doctor suggested i go to an ob/gyn and ask about pcos, as my glucose was slightly elevated (102) & i am obese.    also, my periods were slightly irregular, but only by a few days.    they may start a little early or late, but i have never missed a period.the nurse practitioner didn't think i had pcos, as i had no missed periods, hair loss/increase, acne, etc.    however, she did say i might be eligible for a hysterectomy because of severe pms symptoms & heavy flow, since i'm not trying to get pregnant.my periods are extremely heavy - i use about 1 tampon/hour for the first 2 days & i get very fatigued.    the np thinks i may be anemic during my period, & i have a standing order for a blood test when i get my cycle.also, pms for me is 2+ weeks of severe cramping, anxiety/depression, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, & i often catch some cold or flu as though my immune system has conked out.however, i just don't want to have a hysterectomy.    i would, however, like some relief from the pms and other monthly problems i have.    they've gotten worse as i've gotten older - i only have maybe one week a month where i feel normal.what other options do i have?    i can't take birth control pills (it raises my blood pressure) and the np didn't mention other treatments.    she's supposed to call me in a day or two.    what can i ask her, and what treatments can i mention to her when she calls?
1608,ok i suppose to gotten my period in the beginning of the month but i haven't seen it yet but yesturday feb 23 i get a lil pink an brown spotting an it continue today aint much but its just as small as a sunflower seed that shows up in my pad so i asking whats really going on?
1609,before my question i need to clarify something. i have been with my wife for 20 years. my question is very personal. she will not let me complete, or even start to have regular intercourse before she starts performing oral sex on me. if i attempt to stop her she basically insists on continuing until i climax. then she's satisfied. i'm not. i've talked to her about it to no avail. i've even begged her for just intercourse. before i get a short way into intercourse she says she wants to just kiss it. then she is disappointed if i don't climax while she does this. that's all she wants. i want more than that.question: is she as abnormal as i'm thinking she may be?
1610,i am currently 15 weeks pregnant. and from the start of my pregnancy i have been having these fluttering/palpatations and racing heart. its usually only when i am doing something with exercise.. etc cleaning,showering. it just freaks me out thinking there could be something wrong with me. it doesnt last long and it feels almost like when i take a breath just randomly i get a flutter and then my heart races because it makes me more nervous and worried. if anyone is having the same symptoms or knows if this is normal during pregnancy i would love to hear from you.
1611,remember alaska's bridge to nowhere, a $400 million span that was supposed to connect ketchikan to its airport on sparsely inhabited gravina island? the project gained infamy in 2005 as a waste of taxpayer dollars and the funds earmarked for it were withheld. the 8,000 residents of ketchikan continue to be connected to their airport by ferry.fast forward six years and another remote alaskan airport project is raising questions about how the government spends money.the price this time is $77 million and the place is akutan, a remote island village in the aleutian chain, according to a report from the alaska dispatch.by next winter akutan is scheduled to have a 4,500-foot-long runway, built at a cost of $64 million ($59 million in federal and $5 million state funds), the dispatch reports. the problem is, the runway is on akun island, 6 miles from the village across the treacherous waters of the bering sea. plying those waters can be tricky with seas over 6 feet and winds above 30 mph.original plans called for using a hovercraft - at a cost of $11 million - to ferry passengers from akutan to akun. but, the dispatch points out, the same model hovercraft planned for the route has proven unreliable under similar conditions elsewhere in alaska. and when it did run, operating losses were in the millions.now, transportation officials are considering using a helicopter to ferry passengers from akutan, according to the dispatch report. cost of that is still being determined.should officials get it all figured out and funded, who'll benefit? akutan has a year-round population of 100, but that spikes to about 1,000 in the summer when trident seafoods processing plant, the largest seafood processing plant in north america, is in operation, the dispatch reports. trident is contributing $1 million to the project, the dispatch says.and why is this necessary? air service to akutan is now provided by world war ii-era amphibious aircraft operated by peninsula airways. those are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain, peninsula vice president brian carricaburu told the dispatch.carricaburu also says the runway could cut the government's costs in one way. peninsula airways routes to akutan are now subsidized by about $700,000 annually under the federal essential air service program. using bigger, more efficient aircraft could bring that cost down, he told the dispatch.but to reach that point, it looks like a lot of figurative bridges have to be crossed.source:http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/28/a-64-million-runway-for-no-one-in-alaska/
1612,i have had a cold or something for about a week.    yesterday i began having pain in my left upper teeth, and had i bit of a fever, sore throat, and some congestion.    now the pain seems to have moved to my lower jaw / bottom back molar.    i have heard that a sinus infection can cause pain in the upper teeth.    can it also cause pain in the lowe jaw/ teeth?
1613,i've been having very aggravating vulvar problems. my vulva is dry, red, swollen, itchy and painful. i have no idea what could be wrong... i've been sick lately and am on amoxicillin. this is the only change in diet, lifestyle, anything. my girlfriend gets tested regularly and does not have an std. i've only had sex with one other girl and that was about 5 months ago. i don't have the time to go to an obgyn or a doctor with recruitment. can anyone help?! i can't sit, stand or lay down without irritation. please help!!!!!
1614,i have a question about drusen, i am 24 years old and my eye doctor found a bleeding blood vessel in my eye when i was 9 and it was fixed with lazer surgery, leaving a blind spot in my left eye.    i have drusen in my eyes.    i was wondering how much of a greater risk this put me for macular degeneration and if there is anything i can do it help stop its progression.    and i guess i would really like to know where it came from and just some general information about drusen in young people, all the information i can find is related to older people.
1615,i've been spotting (brown or pink ) on and off for over one month.    i had pelvic ultrasound, blood test and physical exam done and they came back normal.    i am 33 years old and not under any bc pills.    it's not heavy (did not even wear a pantyliner) but i always feel like blood would be coming out when i stand up or walk for awhile.    that feeling makes me very uncomfortable and scared.    i wonder if i have cysts or polyps that cause this kinda spotting.    i wonder if this had happened to anyone?
1616,hi i had a cbc with the following results:rbc 5.4 hct 49 hgb 17.7 mcv 90.9wbc 12.5 granulocytes 8.6 lymphocytes 3.1 mid 0.8plt 397 and esr 3i am concerned about the plt which is near high and the wbc which is slightly above normal range..also ldh normalno doctor ordered the test.. it's a personal check up
1617,a few days ago, i went into the er for incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess. it was packed with iodine gauze and i was sent on my way with antibiotics and pain meds.i was instructed to follow up with the referred surgeon the next day, who would take over the care of the packing and surgery i will eventually need. however, the surgeon can't see me for another 2 weeks.i still have the original packing, now 3 days old, and am not sure what to do. i was given no instruction over diet, taking showers, or how long the packing is good for. i called the same er for help, and the nurse said she didn't know either and hung up on me.i'm responding well to the antibiotics, and the abscess is still draining but the area is still very painful. i can only lie down. in summary:1. how often should the packing be changed?2. what can i eat (the location of the abscess presents obvious difficulties with the need to defecate),
1618,i took a diflucan pill and then also used a monistat one day suppository (with the cream it came with) in the same day thinking i would speed up the healing process and it made it all feel worse. it completely accelerated the burning and itching. what can i do to help this now?    i have read online that i just created a super resistant yeast possibly!    help!

1623,homeopathy has been a blessing for me. i really get a smile on my face when i see physicians dismiss what has helped me so much. as someone who couldn't tolerate allergy injections, i decided to find a practitioner who could help me and i had success with homeopathy. i suggest people and especially physicians try it for themselves and/or do more research on this medicine that is over 200 years old and obviously survived for a reason. i'm sure this is why prince charles and the queen of england both swear by homeopathic treatment.anyhow, here is a great article on homeopathy that was published in the annals of internal medicine:a critical overview of homeopathyhttp://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/138/5/393
1624,hello, i am 23 and have been on the pill for about 3 years now because my period was so out of whack, about a year ago they switched my pills, and i never had any problems with them. i started my period on march 18 then on april 2nd i started to spot, it was very light pink then after two days of that it got a little darker and heavier. it lasted about 10 days, i should have started my period on april 15th and i haven't, would this spotting have taken the place of my period? i'm a little curious about this because i would hate for my period to be so irregular that it messes me up on having kids in the future. and incase this matters, my fiance and i have sex regularly and do not use protection and he rarely ever pulls out.any suggestions??
1625,i had a salipingo oopharectomy last year and also had 2 large cysts removed (fluid filled). i know i have a lot of uterine fibroids and periods have been less painful and less heavy since the op.however,occasionally (3/4 per year) i now experience extremely heavy bleeds not related to periods,containing very large clots and at times can be very difficult to manage/leave the housei have been given transanamic acid to assist with these bleeds but as i have no warning as to when they will ocour - life is difficult. been advised until menopuase or have a hysterectomy nothing can be done. could this be managed with diet? re hormonal levels or is it just the fibroids bursting ? i am 47 and overweight - periods still quite regular.any advice appreciated.thank you.    zz

1630,i've read a few of these posts, and i feel somewhat encouraged. i had a breast reduction in 1999, and the surgeon left me with the unsightly underarm fat or breast tissue is what i'm learning it is. i have had a child, lost weight, gained weight since then and this fat has not gone anywhere. i am recently divorced, and losing weight and want to do something about this. my bras don't fit right, and i live in memphis, so it's hot here! i am never able to wear sleeveless anything because of this. in addition to the underarm issue, i also have to common dog ears breast which is typical after breast reduction surgery. now, that i am hearing some of you say that insurance has covered the removal of this underarm tissue, i am a bit encouraged. are there any veterans in here that can answer about the dog ears, or just any advice about getting the insurance to cover the underarm issue. it's very difficult to find clothes, bras, or dresses to fit because of this.

1635,my dd is now 6 weeks old and was diagnosed with gerd about 3 weeks ago. she never vomited and rarely spit up. she was just extremely fussy, congested, etc. she has had superb weight gain. she weighed 7 lbs 10 oz at birth and now weighs 14 lbs 5 oz.    when she was diagnosed, the pediatrician put her on prevacid and reglan. the reglan was stopped the following day because of severe vomiting. she did not tolerate the medicine well at all. after we stopped the reglan she did not vomit again. two weeks went by and she was doing outstanding! we are thickening her bottles with 2 teaspoons of rice cereal per ounce and there was no more fussiness, no more spitting up, and no vomiting whatsoever. now, as of wednesday, she refuses to eat, screams all day long, and vomits up what little she does eat. she went from eating 5 ounces every 3 hours to 3 ounces every 4-5 hours. could all of this be related to the prevacid? i have heard that it can cause vomiting and stomach pains, but the doctor has told me that the prevacid is all they can give her. i am at a loss as to what to do for her. she also grunts to the point where we, including my dd, do not sleep. it is the most horrible grunting noise i have ever heard.    i can only relate it to that of a pig..but not one..about 30. she is also very very hoarse.    if anyone has any suggestions for me, please help.    her doctor feels there is nothing else that can be done. i am calling tomorrow for a referral to a pediatric gi.
1636,i am writing about my 5 year old step son who has definate learning and behaviour disabilities. i know it is difficult for his mother and father to accept this as nothing concrete has been done to get a diagnosis for him. they have inconsistently taken him to doctor's appointments to check his eyesight and hearing (because he can not speak well and does not listen to obvious speech directed at hime) and he has attended some speech therapy classes. his daycare was the first to notice his behaviour and reccommended he start to go to a special school they have a partnership with that deals with children with behavioural problems. he has been attending for half a day, 4 days a week for this past year. it has been suggested he may have asperger syndrome but this is not for sure but it is obvious he has a disability but it is very frustrating that his parent will not get a concrete answer for what it is so that we can proceed to help him. i try to help him with everything i can because even though he is not my blood related son, i do see him as my own and want the best for him. the bottom line is, he is a child and deserves everything this world has to offer even if it take him a little more time to get it.these are some of the behavioural specifics so you can get an idea of what i am talking about:- he constantly repeats the same things over and over- when i say he doesn't listen when he is called for it is like talking to a statue, he is completely unresponsive- he likes to be alone and not play with others- he can not speak in sentences, he can not say words clearly- he can not answer questions, he just repeats what you ask him back to you- he has an amazing memory- he can not sit still for even 30 seconds, his arms or legs are always squirming- he can not make eyecontact with anyonethose are just some of the things he does. the one i am having trouble with now is his using the toilet. he is going to be entering kindergarden this september and i am so worried for him because he is not ready to be in a class with children that are ready to be there. who is going to help him use the toilet? well, let me explain first. he does not stand up and urinate, that is fine but the issue is that he doesn't concentrate so some of it might get on his pants or on his leg. once this happens he has a fit and will not wear the underwear or pants he has on. also, if he has a bowel movement he does not know how to wipe himself. he has to call someone to help him. i have tried to show him but i am at a loss.the reason i am writing today is because we were at the park and then he had to use the restroom. he was acting strange and did not mention he had already gone in his pants. he would not leave the public restroom with the pants and underwear he had on. i had to pesuade him to come to the car so we could go home, have a bath and change clothes. his mother's solution is to alway send him to school with an extra pair of pants?? how does this solve anything??i am at a loss and i don't want to give up but this is so frustrating.any advice would be greatly appreciated
1637,my daughter is suffering from right eye high miope, she has -2.5 in her left eye too, doctors say her right eye is has no vision, pls suggest.regards:deepak kalra
1638,my husband complains of seeing yellow or reddish spots on his vision when he moves his eyes from side to side.    so if he quickly moves his eyes and then looks at the white wall, he sees yello and at times red spots.    sometimes he sees them all day, especially the yellow ones but at times he has days his vision is completely normal, he's in his late 20s.    what can it possibly be?    he's been seeing black and clear floaters for a while but the opthalmologist told him his eyes looked great, this was before seeing the yellow and red spots.

1640,hoping someone can help with this one.    my son is having a sleepover tonite w/another 8yr old boy and all had been going, the boys were having fun.    when time for bed we had set up a blow up mattress for our guest and my son was to sleep in his own bed.    left the boys in there to play/talk for a bit before bed, but when i checked in on them after a bit, opened the door to the room and saw the guest jump into the bed naked.    my son and the boy were both on the inflatable, each with his own blanket covering him but they were nervously pulling up thier pants when i came in.    i asked my son to leave the room so i could speak with him and we went to the guest room where i asked him what was going on.    after asking him multiple times why they were naked and reminding him only lying will get him in trouble he told me that his friend told him to sleep naked.    i asked him if his friend mentioned why he should do this and he was hesitatnt to tell me b/c he was afraid to get in trouble but he told me his friend told him to do this to prove he could sleep next to a lady.i asked if there was anything else he wanted to tell me but he seemed like he genuinely told me all of the truth. he was visibly upset and crying.    i did ask him outright if anyone touched each other and he said no.    i asked him if his freind saw his privates and he said no, that they covered themselves.    i told my son he would sleep in our bed tonight while his guest would sleep in his room.    i then went into my son's room and questioned the friend asking him what had happed and he just said i don't know. i asked in a different way but still got the same answer.    i asked if he thought he might remember if i called his mom and he shrugged and said i really just don't know    - unlike my son he didn't seem visibly upset, actually fairly calm.    since he didn't implicate my son but also didn't have an answer i figured my son was telling the truth.    i explained that my son would be sleeping with us and he would have my son's room for the night.my son is an only child and his friends are incredibly imprtant to him; he has taken a particular liking to this boy as they seem to have a lot of the same interests - lego, robots, wii etc.    however i'm very concerned about this incident.    this is not the first time this has happened with this boy.    my son slept at his house a couple of months ago and in conversation driving home after the sleepover my son told us that he and the friend had man talk and sat naked in the boy's room.    we explained to him at the time that it is not appropriate to do that, that his privates were not for display and that he is always to have his clothes on    - underwear and pj's should have been on. these are the only 2 times it has happened and it only seems to happen with this particular boy.    when i talked with my son this evening i asked him how he felt about what he was doing when his friend asked and he said he didn't think it was right so i asked him why he did it and his simple response was because he told me to do it.    i explained that he needs to be able to make his own decisions about right and wrong and if something feels wrong, even in the littlest bit, he should not do it no matter how good a friend it is that is asking him to do the wrong or inappropriate thing.should i let him continue this friendship?    should i mention something to the other mother about this?    i didn't say anything last time.
1641,cateract surgery on monday, and i am really suffering.    this is not optional surgery, i developed a dense cateract and deterioration of the lense following treatment for a epiretinal membrane and swelling.    i feel like i have been in pain for weeks.    i am terified.    this is the first interaction i have had with the medical community ever. i do not get sick.     (i had my kids at home).my doctor, and my surgen just don't get how scared i am. i am also a type a personality that doesn't stop at work.    i am not coping well.    any advice?

1643,http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/obama-hold-press-conference-11-15-m-141554262--politics.htmlbringing the curtain down on his first term with a combative press conference, president barack obama vowed monday to push vigorously for gun control measures and pressed foes of new restrictions in the aftermath of the newtown tragedy to examine their own conscience. obama admitted he faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates in congress and vowed executive action in the face of any legislative logjam.one month to the day after the elementary school slaughter in connecticut, the president said he had received recommendations from vice president joe biden's task force for curbing a national epidemic of gun violence.they  ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw in newtown doesn  t happen again, he told reporters.   i  ll present the details later in the week.  but will congress adopt proposals like renewing the assault weapons ban?   i don  t know,   acknowledged obama, who was due to discuss the issue with biden later on monday.  my starting point is not to worry about the politics. my starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we  re reducing the incidence of gun violence, the president said.   i think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the 2nd amendment.  obama also warned congressional republicans on monday that he will not trade spending cuts for their vote to raise the country  s debt ceiling.obama called republican talk of not raising the limit  of, in effect, not paying the country  s bills    irresponsible   and   absurd.   he said the gop will   not collect a ransom in return for not crashing the economy.  we are not a deadbeat nation,   he said.at issue is the congressionally established debt limit, which the country is set to reach shortly. without additional borrowing, the government will not be able to pay all of its bills, raising the prospect of a default on national debt payments or washington being forced to stop issuing social security checks, pay to troops overseas and other legally required outlays, according to obama. either option would likely send shock waves through the fragile global economy.raising the debt limit was mostly a matter of routine in washington under presidents of both parties for decades. the opposition would make a big show of wringing its hands over the nation  s finances (as a senator in 2006, obama himself called it   a sign of leadership failure), and the majority would find a way to pass it.republicans broke sharply from that script in august 2011, when they demanded spending cuts equal to the amount that the limit would be raised. the ensuing standoff brought the nation to the brink of default and led to the first-ever downgrade of the country  s credit rating  but also to historic spending cuts, signed into law by obama. top republican lawmakers have said publicly that this time they may be willing to partially shut down the government to secure more reductions.  our economy is growing and our businesses are creating new jobs, so we are poised for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investments   and so long as washington politics   don  t get in the way,   the president said.
1644,my left upper eyelid is tender to touch & both eyelids are somewhat itchy. there is no redness or swelling & both eyeballs look fine. could this be allergies of some sort, if so is there any over the counter medication i could use?
1645,hello! i am new to these forums, and would appreciate anyone's ideas about my problem.i just recently (about a month ago) stopped eating food additives, especially msg. a few days afterwards i noticed that the chronic swelling of my legs had gone down dramatically. i dropped about 5 pounds within a week. but then i felt very ill for a couple days- body aches, general flu like symptoms, of which i understood to be the die-off or healing crisis i have read alot about.i then had a very busy weekend a few days later, and was not able to eat much because the place where i was working (i am a filmmaker and projectionist and help out at a venue where they put on shows) did not have good food readily available. as i had noticed profound changes in my mood ( i had suffered from depression for months and suddenly it was gone, as were my racing thoughts, worry etc) i was not prepared to eat ****. so i ate very little. and i wound up coming down with the worst sickness i have ever had- strep throat and an ear infection.consequently, i have lost 7 pounds in a little under a month- and i am wondering if my body is purging and perhaps the strep was inside me all along and either this is a detox reaction, or else i was simply undernourished and compromised.let me say that i am not trying to lose weight like this. i changed my diet because of my depression. i had no idea that the results would be so dramatic- i tend to be pretty sensitive to things, don't eat wheat anymore because it makes my pulse race (and i don't know why)....but i just find it very weird that after making this great discovery about food additives and msg i drop weight quickly and get horribly sick.i eat organic, fresh fruits and veg, organic milk, no sugar, no wheat, no processed foods at all anymore. my diet is cleaner than it has ever been. with strep i wasn't able to eat much.anyone have any experience with anything like this?
1646,my son's kindergarten class sends its kids to the bathroom unaccompanied by an adult.    the bathroom is down the hall of the class and i wanted to know if it is safe to let 5yr olds go to the bathroom alone in a public school?    i don't think they should be sent by themselves.    recently my 5 year old was in the bathroom with another boy and my son put soap on the other boy's head and got in trouble.    but i question the safety of the school having allowed the children to be unaccompanied in the bathroom.    boys will be boys and together may play in the bathroom if they are not being supervised by an adult.    what is your professional thought?
1647,(cnn) -- before the economic recession hit in 2007, lana melnik was a college counselor at northeastern university in massachusetts guiding hundreds of students towards employment.now, at 57, she's been laid off from her school, and she is taking temporary stints as a substitute teacher until she secures a full-time job.my friends are asking me, how are you still managing? melnik said. i tell them i'm still standing.and she's not alone.more than 55 percent of adults in the u.s. labor force are feeling the impact of unemployment or wage and work hour reductions since the economic downturn began 2   years ago, according to a broad report from the pew research center's social and demographic trends project.this recession has left a mark on a lot of things, says paul taylor, project director at the pew research center. it's changed behaviors and it's changed expectations.the study, which is based on the interviews of 3,000 americans by telephone in may and on federal economic and demographic data, found the economy is taking a financial toll on many american families. the length of unemployment has surged, averaging about six months, the report said. this six-month period surpasses the previous record average length of unemployment in the 1982 to 1983 recession, which was about three months.read about the stigma of unemploymentshrinking and disappearing paychecks have put strains on family finances. one out of two adults surveyed said their finances are suffering more since the recession started, the study said. only 20 percent say they are in better financial shape since the recession began.with less disposable income, the recession has caused american families to rethink their spending habits, the study finds. about six out of ten americans reported tightening their spending habits. about a third surveyed said they will continue being frugal with expenses even when the recession is over. but a majority say they plan to revert to their pre-recession spending habits.and if american families are looking to find money in their homes, they are likely to find bad news in the short term. about 48 percent of homeowners surveyed said the value of their home dropped during the recession. of those who believe their house is worth less, nearly half believe it will take three to five years for the value of their home to recover from the recession.but despite the shrinking value, the vast majority of those polled say owning a home is the best long term investment.the groups taking the biggest hit from the economic downturn -- blacks and young adults -- are more upbeat about a recovery than are whites and older adults. the survey also found democrats to have a more positive view than republicans.retirement is a vexing issue for many americans, who have dipped into their savings and assets to survive, pew center experts said. about 32 percent of adults fear they will not have enough money to retire, an increase from 25 percent in february 2009.the survey also posed an long-term question to the adults about the future of their children. about 25 percent surveyed said they think their children will have a worse standard of living than they experienced, up from ten percent of americans expressing that view a decade ago. however, blacks, hispanics and young adults hold a more positive view of intergenerational progress than whites and older adults.other findings of the study are encouraging, pew researchers point out. about 62 percent of americans believe their personal finances will improve in the coming year.
1648,my daughter has mild ataxic cerebral palsy.    she also has considerable sensory processing issues.    she is the child that seeks out sensations.    she hangs upside down, has a very high pain threshold, has an overwhelming and compulsive urge to play with water, cover herself in mud etc. she has good physio and occupational therapy plans in place at home for both of her conditions.i need to find some really good information/guides to give her teachers at her new school.    regardless of any reports that her previous school have given, her new school are regarding her as a naughty child, and as a result my positive, sunny-natured child is unhappy, resisting going to school and is becoming more and more negative as a result.apart from the book the out-of sync child, where can i get some good published information from?many thanks

1652,my jaw hurts on my left side and i just went to the dentist 2 weeks ago for an irrigation. a week after going my jaw hasn't been normal on that side. i am not sure why. i called the office and all i was told is to pust warmth on that side and if it gets worse to call. well each morning i can barely open my mouth. i it just the side where i had work done so can it still be tmj? i can't imagine that it would only affect one side. has anyone had this happen or have a clue what it is or if it could be connected to my appointment in any way? i hate to go back to the dentist if its not an emergency and it shoud go away. its not really painful to the point i can't eat or have to take meds. i just can't open it that far without pain. anyway thanks!
1653,i've had a few symptoms on my penis recently that are starting to worry me. i occasionally get very small white spots on my penis head which seem to appear every now and then, but a couple of days ago i got some more symptoms.main one is a very swollen foreskin, which is itchy and have a slight burning sensation. i also have these white spots on the top of my penis and also the bottom of my penis head has a very white and red scabby look. like the skin is breaking.any idea what this could be and the best cure? i have had regular unprotected sex with my girlfriend who is on the pill for the last year, but no one else. so hoping its not an std.
1654,close your eyes and picture having sex with the same sex.    this grosses me out. personally i could not have sex with a women.    would you let society tell you that you must have sex with the same sex even though it repulses you. no way.    well gay people feel the same way.......most gay women are repulsed at the thought of having sex with a man, and gay men with women.    they don't choose this. why in the world would they ?    should they be sentenced to a life without love ?    that would be the one of the cruelest things we could impose on someone. would your god (which ever one your pray to) want this.    i think not.    so don't hide prejudice behind religion.
1655,i have red itchy bumps on my stomach legs arms and back. it almost looks like mosquito bites but they go away and come back. any idea what it is
1656,i just received copies of letters from my rheumatologist to my gp.    i am happy to announce that he finds me a well developed and slightly overweight young woman.    i am actually pleased!    especially when medhelp considers me obese!    better than a fat, middle aged woman.    thought i'd share that with you guys.

1659,my son has been a fabulous sleeper since he was about a year.    he's now almost 3, and he's a twin, so he shares a room with his brother.    he is now suddenly waking 5 to 8 times a night, fully awake when he does.    he wants us to cover him, kiss him, whatever.    we are not great with letting him cry it out.    in fact, we can't.    he's waking up the whole household over and over, and we're exhausted.    i'm just not sure what to do with him--he has a nightlight, a very regimented bed time routine that we've done for 3 years (bath, books, warm milk, bed), he has music that plays the same song over and over each night.    please help!

1661,girl's friend reported seeing cell phone video of rape in abandoned trailerhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43651904/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/liberty, texas    more than a dozen men accused of taking part in a series of sexual assaults on an 11-year-old girl are expected in court wednesday in a case that has divided and horrified their southeast texas town.the 14 men, who along with five juvenile boys are facing charges, are scheduled to be in a state district courtroom in liberty for status updates. the investigation began in december, after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a lurid cell phone video that showed the girl being raped in an abandoned trailer.authorities say the girl was assaulted on at least five occasions, sometimes by as many as seven or eight young men or boys at a time, from mid-september to early december in cleveland, a small city about 45 miles northeast of houston. the suspects range in age from a middle-school student to a 27-year-old, and include two star athletes at the local high school as well as adults with criminal records.most of the adult suspects face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child. most have pleaded not guilty and are free on bond, while one, 26-year-old marcus porchia, was charged after his arrest with sexually assaulting another girl in an unrelated case.girl, family blamedthe case shined a sometimes unflattering spotlight on cleveland after some in the town of about 9,000 residents suggested the girl was culpable in part for what happened, claiming she wore makeup and looked older. some also accused her parents, immigrants from mexico, of not watching her more closely. those suggestions were sharply criticized by many cleveland residents and by community and religious groups outside the city.also complicating the case was a belief by many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. all of the suspects are black, while the girl is hispanic.the girl, now 12, remains in foster care as her parents, who have health problems and moved out of cleveland after receiving threatening phone calls, work with state child welfare authorities to get her back.a gag order is preventing those connected to the case from commenting.authorities began investigating after the girl's friend told a teacher he had seen a video that had been passed around among classmates that showed the girl being attacked. police determined it was recorded inside a mobile home on the city's northern outskirts.the girl told investigators she was raped nov. 28, first at a house near the mobile home and then at the trailer. indictments allege she also was assaulted in september, october and december.
1662,i was on an elevator with 2 other guys.1 of the guys was close up to the doors and when he got off, the guy left with me reached in his pocket and started rumaging around 'down there' with rapid up and down hand movement..i tried not to notice but out of the corner of my eye i could see that all the while he was doing that, he was watching me the whole time.i know he saw me because (in my opinion) if i saw him then he could see me.part of me tends to believe that he was gay because he didn't stop when he saw me    or said this isn't what it looks like' or waited the 30- seconds until the elevator stopped on his floor.i talked to someone at work about it and she said that the reason he didn't say anything was that he probably was embarrassed.the same guy would look up (nobody else) whenever i would say hi to a woman almost everytime i would deliver mail up the aisle that he works in.
1663,i have only had sex 4 times but everytime i do my boyfriend says that there is blood on the condom and enough to get on his hands. also i cant have sex to long becuase it starts to hurt. is it becuase it was my first time trying new positions? or is something wrong with me?

1665,both democratic and republican senators have protected contributors with filibusters. (reuters/jonathan ernst.)as momentum builds to reform the horrendously broken rules of the senate, a cadre of washington d.c. politicos are fighting back, arguing that the filibuster in its current form must be preserved.last week, steven duffield, in an opinion column for the washington examiner, pleaded for the status quo, claiming   senate liberals want to gut   the filibuster, which he called a   long-standing protection for minorities.   duffield, bylined simply as   vice president for policy at crossroads gps,   didn  t point to any examples of filibusters protecting the rights of minorities or marginalized groups. he listed other complaints, like the charge that rules reform will allow the senate to   rubber stamp   obama  s nominees to the supreme court.in reality, the proposed reforms do not affect appointments to the supreme court. and a more comprehensive reading of the filibuster  s history would show that when it comes to civil rights for oppressed minority groups, the filibuster has actually served as a great obstacle for justice.maybe duffield is alarmed about rules reform  which would limit anonymous holds, allow for a   talking filibuster   and expedite deliberations for some nominees  for another reason: his pocketbook.two years ago, i took a screen shot and saved a tidbit from duffield  s now-deleted consulting website. duffield  s firm, still lobbying and called endgame strategies, was quite candid in it  s pitch to potential corporate clients to use   backbench senate republicans   to block legislation (emphasis added):managing holds and filibusters. your organization has an interest in a bill that has proven controversial and you require advocacy before those legislators  often backbench senate republicans  who may exercise their prerogatives to delay or obstruct. endgame strategies will give you new ways to manage your interests in a legislative environment that gives great power to individual senators.duffield, a former senate aide to arizona republican jon kyl, literally sold filibusters, anonymous holds and the other forms of obstruction. in 2011, he reported at least $230,000 in lobbying fees. current rules allow a senator to secretly block any legislation or nominee and then, without actually performing a talking filibuster, require a three-fifths majority vote  twice  to proceed eventually with a regular majority vote, a process ripe for abuse by well-connected political operators of both parties.i  ve detailed before how lobbyists, even agents for foreign governments, have secured republican filibusters at a shocking rate. the cottage industry around monetizing filibusters has grown rapidly since obama  s first election. from 2009 to 2010, there were more filibusters filed than during the 1950s through 1960s combined, as the nation  s katrina vanden heuvel observed.the interesting dynamic for me is, how money in politics has incentivized this contraction of democratic governance. here are just a few examples of how powerful industries have usurped the normal gears of government, and used senate obstruction to push policies that punish ordinary americans and the environment:   senator david vitter (r-la) placed holds on obama epa nominees to delay scientific assessments on the health risks of formaldehyde, which is produced by some of his largest campaign contributors.   according to a new report from public campaign action fund, republican senate leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) has collected a hundreds of thousands in funds from the same industries he has protected with filibusters, particularly from oil companies and the finance sector. mcconnell has led filibusters to protect oil subsidies, to block efforts to mitigate the mortgage crisis, and against campaign disclosure reforms.   senator richard shelby (r-al) placed a   blanket hold   on every obama nominee to force the administration to accept a northrop grumman contract to build a $35 billion refueling tanker in mobile, alabama. northrop grumman is a major shelby donor.   senator john mccain (r-az) blocked the nomination of one of obama  s most important department of labor nominees for months, which many believe led the us chamber of commerce to aggressively support mccain during a contentious primary with a tea party  backed candidate in 2010.   senator mary landrieu (d-la), a close ally of the oil and gas industry, temporarily blocked obama  s nominee for the office of management and budget to extract an administration promise to allow more oil drilling leases in the gulf of mexico following the deepwater horizon catastrophe.   senator bob corker (r-tn) filibustered the federal aviation administration reauthorization bill in order to demand a policy that prevents fedex drivers from unionizing. fedex is corker  s third-highest campaign donor.at the nexus of all of this obstruction are lobbyists who are making a small fortune negotiating these tactics.another politico complaining about changing the filibuster, martin gold  a lobbyist for covington and burling who represents qualcomm, bp, amazon.com, bae systems, the principality of liechtenstein, among others  told investor  s business daily recently that rules reform is   unprecedented and unwise.  gold  s somber warning contrasts pretty sharply with the giddy language used to describe a government affairs seminar he led in 2011. the american league of lobbyists promoted the event with the following language:   can you turn congressional rules and procedures into a tactical advantage for achieving your policy goals? absolutely!  the national rifle association is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in washington. see how the organization helps the gun industry reap even greater profits following

1668,i recently found out my 9 year old is urinating in the bathtub instead of the toilet.    this is not occuring during a shower.    my child was washing feet with soap and not rinsing.    now that habit has been replaced by urinating in the tub.    my child doesn't want to touch the floor around the toilet.    when confronted it was said that if the toilet is used the feet would need to be cleansed.    there is no diagnosis of adhd, but we feel their are ocd habits.i don't know how to address this behavior.    how strongly to punish etc.    my husband and i are upset by the behavior, but mostly upset by the secretive behavior.    we feel we cannot allow bathroom access withoutone of us observing the behavior.
1669,5 years ago i had cavenous sinus thrombosis and got diabetes insipidus as a result. i am on warfarin for life and desmopressin. i was in hospital for 8 weeks and had double vision for about the same length of time. my head still has clots but is 90% clear. when i first came out and my vision went back to normal for a time my prescription improved. over the last 2/3 years it has got worse and each time i go to the opticians they seem concerned. they do field tests which i struggle with, but i think this is more that the test is so close, and when i look at the screen instead of being a plain backgroud appears sort of wavy/swirly. last time specsavers sent me to the doctors, the doctors were unconcerned by the change. i've just been again and once again they are referring me to the doctors. i have not seen the doctor yet. over the last 2/3 years my prescription has changed by about +2/3 in both eyes and the other measurements have increased as well. why do my eyes keep changing ????? am i going blind ???? what should i do/say when i see the doctor ???? i also have had trouble over the last few years where i see blue sparks/flickers, this happened on time when i was rubbing my eye and happened ever since. also when im in bed and i have my left eye shut and i move it or touch it i get like white flash at the top or bottom of my eye. i am so worried !!!!!!
1670,i had lyposuction on my neck, breasts, back, stomach, inner thighs, and arms.    the doctor told me he removed 20 lbs of fat.    it has been 9 weeks and i've only lost 10 lbs with exercise and diet.    i was told i should drop a size in the first 4 weeks.    i haven't!    the 5.5 hr surgery went ok and i felt most of my pain in my arms and stopped using pain meds after 2 days post-op.    i'm very disappointed in my hips and thighs, the doctor keeps telling me i should be dropping inches any day but it could take up to 6 months for the total results.    how can it be that the surgeon removed 20 lbs and i only lost 10?    has anyone else had this procedure and took over 2 months to have results?    thanks!
1671,this old thread seems to contain several people who experience exactly the same problem that i am experiencing - none of them seem to have a diagnosis:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/307669;for 8 months now, i've had a bright spot in my right eye, i notice it most when i blink or when i stare at a bright background such as the sky. it crawls all the time which sometimes can be disruptive while reading. four squares are missing on the amsler grid when i look at it with my right eye. the vision failure is at 11 o clock, near the center of my vision.i previously had a small serous blister on the foveal wall, which now is gone with no apparent scarring. since i see this spot in a completely dark room with my eyes closed it sounds like a neurological problem more than a retinal one ,and the blister may have been unrelated at not causing this particular vision loss.an mri was negative. the optic nerves seemed fine.has anyone with this problem actually received a working diagnosis? i'd be happy to hear more from the people in the thread. are there any suggestions from a medical professional how to continue or any ideas. my doctor wants me to wait and see, but it's not likely that this will go away since it has been unchanged for so long. i'd also like to understand the triggering event (i was very stressed the week the blind spot first appeared, could be related) so i can avoid doing it again.
1672,a friend at another forum reminded me that you are here, and i decided to come for a visit.    i have an enormous collection of healthy cookbooks; at 5'3' i at one point weighed 255, until i decided to change my eating habits.    i'll talk about that when i visit the diet forum!    :o)    i love the thought of trading recipes and ideas with others!thanks for being here!kathy
1673,i have this friend, i've known her for years (we go back til our hs days) i just dont know what to tell her anymore. not to be mean but i have my fair share of bf problems as it is to be hearing about hers. here's the thing....years back, and i'm talking about almost 5 years ago. she was up late one night bored as she claimed and entered a chat group on y! began chatting with this guy 1:1 afterwords. they started chatting more and more frequently til shortly after became a couple. now, shes never met the guy & its been almost 5 years. they say ily and all over the phone and i still dont understand how you can tell someone something like ily when you have never met them personally. shes only known the guy by online (chat, myspace etc) and phone. to me the guy seems a fake just trying to see what girls he can get online because hes not willing to come visit her. he lives in virginia, we are in ca. & he always seems to have excuses of why he cant come. if you love her as he claims he does, he would try to come visit her especially after so many yrs.one night she got bored again and found that her bf had another myspace account which she was not aware of. his top friend, gf #2!    she made a fake profile and sent him a request. shortly to find that there was pix of him and this other gf kissing. the 2nd gf had a pix of him and her kissing on her page & status was in a relationship. she swore over and over she would break up with him. even came to my house crying (we live a street away) i stood with her like 6 hours comforting her and talking. only to know that she decided to forgive him. fine, forgive and move on right? well i told her how can you trust someone whos so far away and had already cheated on you!? you dont know if he will do it again and again. again, she broke into his y! email account and found several emails from girls asking if he was single. all replies back to the girls were yes once again, here we go again. she began swearing she was done! but once again forgave him. i for myself speak and admit that i have in the past cheated on my bf 3xs. & all 3 x's he forgave me. so i understand what it is to forgive and so on. but with a guy she's never met?she has not had a job for years! i've even told her, i think the reason you dont get up and get a job is because your only source of communication with this guy is phone. she gets so upset when she misses a call. this woman does not leave the house just to be waiting for his calls. i dont know what to tell her anymore. i am tired of hearing chris this and that! its frustrating because i've told her as much as i can but she keeps staying with this guy whos shes never met and she swears its love.any ideas on what i can tell her? i'm dry!

1675,my fiance and i have been together for 4 years and we have been sexually active.    after sex, my butt itches and it is kind of sore.    we don't even do anything during sex to make it sore.    she is usually on top and i am wondering if her fluids could be a result of the itching.    it has been going on for several years.    usually the next day i am itching like crazy and i can never reach it.    it feels like the itch is inside my rectum.    we have both been tested for std's and they came up negative.    it's an itchy, burning sensation and it is very uncomfortable. any help will be appreciated.

1680,theodore    roosevelt's ideas on immigrants and being an    american in 1907.'in    the first place, we should insist that if the    immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes    an american and assimilates himself to us, he    shall be treated on an exact equality with    everyone else, for it is an outrage to    discriminate against any such man because of    creed, or birthplace, or origin. but this is    predicated upon the person's becoming in every    facet an american, and nothing but an    american...there can be no divided allegiance    here. any man who says he is an american, but    something else also, isn't an american at all.    we have room for but one flag, the american    flag... we have room for but one language here,    and that is the english language.. and we have    room for but one sole loyalty and that is a    loyalty to the american    people.'theodore    roosevelt 1907
1681,this is really embarrasing, ok. well i masturbate (who hasn't) and this has been happening since i was first able to ejaculate. i get no real sense of pleasure from the ejaculation, i thought there was supposed to be some sorta of orgasm, where your body would just ripple with pleasure, but no, i get some pleasure leading up to the ejaculation but 2 seconds after i ejaculate, it's just done. i'm not tired, i'm not even slightly exhausted from it. honestly, im a bit worried. i want to get the full pleasure from this, otherwise i predict my sexual life might be pretty dull. i'm quite young and i just want some answers, or some tips on what to do. i mean i ejaculate and it's over. quite boring really. so i'd appreciate any help or advice.
1682,hi,we are struggling to get our almost 4.5 yr old potty trained and to go on his own. he goes pee in the potty with reminders and will go on his own about half the time or tell us he needs to go. the other times he has accidents which is when he is busy or occupied so is understandable.now he won't go poop in the potty at all. he knows he is going i think, as he does it right in front of us and doesn't seem to care. we ask him if he is doing something and needs to go to the bathroom and he saids he is not doing nothing and gets quiet while he is going in his pants and then runs and laughs and makes it a power struggle to get him changed. we ask him to go in the bathroom and clean up and he simply refuses and runs and hides and makes it very frustrating. sometimes when he goes pee and he has pooped, he goes pee and pulls his dirty underwear back up. i don't know if he knows or if he doesn't care he has dirty pants.we have stopped used pull ups during the day awhile back, and he goes to pre-school and daycare and in the past 2-3 weeks both have asked he wear pull ups at preschool and daycare until he poops in the potty on his own.we have tried everything with him and nothing is getting to him. we have tried reward charts, stickers, special prizes, etc. we got him some bigger prizes for when he goes poop on his own and he wants them but they sit on the shelf un opened still.we have brought this concern up to his pediatrician and he saids it is normal behavior and he'll get it eventually. we are concerned and frustrated as if he doesn't get this figured out soon he won't be able to go to kindergarden, etc.we are concerned of his behavior while he is doing it and not caring and then running away. how do we stop that?    we have tried taking toys away for this behavior, etc and again nothing seems to have an effect.
1683,hello, i am not sure if this will make sense but, i have a thing with my eyes were if i'm having a conversation with someone and i look them directly in the eye, my eye lids will tend to rapidly open fully and then return back to normal. i have been made aware of this by people in the past so i now know if it has happened because the person i am talking to will do the exact same thing in response.i have a feeling it may be nerves but i don't feel nervous when talking to people except for when i have to look them in the eye.i guess i am just curious    to see if this is a common thing and are there any exercises to overcome this.thanking you in advance.
1684,i'm a 28 year old male, and i have been experiencing frequent urination x 2 years that has gradually gotten worse. i pee in 2 streams, and it's especially frequent at night. i also have blood in my rectum after a bowel movement, and i'm having 2-3 a day with diarrhea. i have swollen lumps around my r adam's apple, and a swollen lymph node under my chin. i have been tested neg for std's and hiv.i have a persistent itch on the back of my neck with no rash and an itchy rash under my nose. i sometimes suffer from insomnia. i constantly have to clear my throat after dinner, and am constantly belching. i'm sometimes dizzy during the day in class, and i frequently get cold. i've been checked for my prostate, and urination, and have been told that everything appears normal. please help!!! i don't know where else to go or what to do!
1685,it is tooth #3 on this chart http://www.bcbst.com/members/dental/toothchart.pdfit's an upper tooth on the right side of my mouth, second from the back, and my wisdom teeth are removed.i had a large metal/mercury filling on the tooth and it was feeling totally fine. during a cleaning the dentist suggested that i have it changed to a crown because it could be leaking. i said okay, so he prepped the tooth for a crown, put a temp on, and told me to chew on the other side.    i did and went in for the permanent crown. i could not chew on that side without sharp pain. i went back for countless adjustments, still couldn't chew without pain. had no pain unless i tried to chew on that side. he decided the crown must be wrong and cut it off. he then prepped the tooth for a new crown and placed temporary, and now i have pain all the time. it isn't pain in that tooth though, but in my lower jaw it seems. if i take 2 advil in the morning around 6:00 and 2 advil around 4 or 5:00 i feel no pain, but i sure can tell if i've waiting to long to take it again. this has been for a solid 1.5 weeks now with no difference in the pain. also, still can't chew anything without a sharp pain. i'm questioning if i should maybe just have the new crown put on with temp cement and see how that goes, or if that would be making the situation worse?the other issue is that i am at a new job and my dental insurance doesn't begin for another couple months. i can't really afford to do a root canal now, however i've already paid for the crown.
1686,(cnn) -- a 30-year-old registered nurse faces capital murder charges in the death of a houston-area woman and the abduction of the victim's newborn son, according to an arrest report.verna mcclain of houston was arrested just before midnight tuesday, according to the report. she is accused of shooting kala golden, 28, to death outside a pediatrician's office earlier in the day and kidnapping golden's 3-day-old son, keegan schuchardt.the baby was found about six hours later, authorities said, and would be reunited with his father.according to the arrest report, golden was leaving the northwoods pediatric center in the houston suburb of spring, carrying keegan.the defendant confronted mrs. golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot, the report said, then took the baby and left. cnn affiliate ktrk reported that the suspect struck golden as she screamed and attempted to chase after the car. golden, who was shot repeatedly, died at a hospital.mcclain's vehicle was found at an apartment complex, according to the report. mcclain returned to the apartment as the investigation was continuing and asked to speak to police, the report said.she admitted to shooting mrs. golden and taking her baby, the arrest report said. the defendant admitted to taking the child to her residence in harris county which is where keegan was later located.during an interview with authorities, mcclain provided information that only someone at the scene would know, the report said.mcclain's sister, corina jackson, told police her sister had told her she would be adopting a child soon.after killing golden and kidnapping keegan, defendant stated to corina that she now had the child and would be needing to do the adoption, indicating that the abduction of the child was her motive for killing golden, the report said.authorities said tuesday that golden and the woman parked next to her at the doctor's office apparently spoke to one another before the shooting.they were talking, witness tia collins told ktrk. i did see the lady get out, and they were struggling. she said she heard gunshots and saw golden fall.the shooting shocked many in spring, 20 miles north of houston.jennifer hartis, a friend of the victim's, was one of the many left wondering why.she never did anything wrong. she's just a mom doing her best to take care of her kids, and i miss her, hartis told kprc. keegan is only 3 days old. he's needs to know his mom, and she can't do that now. henry schuchardt, keegan's paternal grandfather, told the affiliate he was searching for answers.i wished i knew. i wished i knew, the crestfallen grandfather said. i don't know how they could do this.source: http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/18/justice/texas-pediatrician-shooting/index.html?hpt=us_c2
1687,has anyone tried this diet pill?    all the reviews i have read sound like it is a wonder drug; boosting mood and burning fat.i have taken this for a week now and the only thing boosted is my irritability from the caffeine (which i'm not used to, so it makes me jitter) and the only thing burning is the lining of my stomach and esophagus probably from the cayenne pepper in it.i've decided to stick with it (3 pills twice/day, ug!) and would really like to hear any feedback you might have about it.

1693,i have an eight year old son who is the middle of three boys.    he excels at school and reads and does math above his grade level.    lately, he's been having a lot of difficulty at home including swearing, hitting, breaking things when angry.    he's been worse since his good friend was diagnosed with leukemia.    he exhibits no outbursts at school but is unbearable at home.    we use time-out and loss of privileges (like time off bedtime) as consequences.    we have to walk away when he's at his worst state because he provokes a fight from us.    do you think this is odd??    thanks for the help.

1695,i have a question about myself, just last night i had a wierd dream of having unprotected sex with my girl friend. now i looked up on the net about sleepwalking, and i found    you carry out sex acts during your sleep, fully unaware that you are doing so. the behavior may be limited to your own bedroom, or you might actually leave your home, sleepwalk to your girlfriend  s house and have a night of wild sex that you won  t remember in the morning. i know my girl friend's house is very far. i'm not sure if sleepwalkers can open the door or even unlock the door but i have found my door's lock to be unlocked. when i was in my dream it actually felt real, like it was real sex. when i woke up from the nightmare i was found in my bed. is this a major problem? should i get tested for stds/hiv afterwards?

1701,my son has been complaining of abdominal pain since sunday morning. i let it go sunday thinking maybe a pulled muscle or some gas or something. all day sunday he was holding his tummy. laying around and like limping with it. it hurt when he sneezed, coughed, getting out of a chair, out of bed, etc. felt like he couldn't bend over or anything. he needed help. had no fever, nothing else abnormal.mon still going on. i called our insurance plan nurse and she suggested taking him to urgent care. we got there and the nurse decided er . doc came in and i told him everything. they took blood/urine and strep swab and all came out normal.xrays showed full bowels which honestly has been an ongoing problem for him, but was always relieved by laxatives. however, he has bowel movements normally and is not constipated. most of the time, they are long, soft stools (normal).the doc then said we get a very small pic from an xray - and this certainly could be early signs of appendicitis - so you need to keep an eye on him and watch for high fever and/or vomiting. now, he has definately had a lack of appetite. he is drinking fluids just fine as well.today he was the same. holding his right side but still sent him off to school. he said it is his middle and lower right side that hurts. but he still can walk around the house (while holding his belly) with a smile on his face and playing a little bit but certainly not running around and bending over any.i've been scouring the internet for other possible causes. he's had two bowel movements since sunday with no problems and with no relief of pain in belly.what scares me is could this be his appendix beginning to act up and possibly burst? without all the classic symptoms? should i demand more testing? we do go see his pediatrician on monday for a follow up, but should i wait that long?any advice is appreciated. thank you.

1706,i work with a man that is constantly talking of not having money because his wife manages their budget.    he is allowed to have $20.00 per week in cash, but has to account for each and every dollar spent.it's friday and normally, a lady in my office and i go grab a burger or something and visit - on fridays.    it's usually no more than $5.00-$6.00.    he's new and we have invited him to lunch on a few occasions and as long as we paid - he would go.    he just told us that he has the money to go but his wife didn't tell him he could use his $5.00 today.    i asked him if he didn't have a debit card and he said, yes, but i am not allowed to use it.     he was actually counting change to see if he could get an order of fries when she and i went!granted he was out of work for a couple of months, but we just found out that (he told us) that he received 6 months salary when he was laid off.    this isn't someone making $6.50 an hour - i do the payroll and know what he makes and it's definitely not a nominal amount.    he has also mentioned that he doesn't have any large bills - 1 car payment - small house payment (under $700 a month) - his mother buys his family their clothes - his wife works....    nothing unusual (oh and no credit cards)....why he shard that is beyond me....i understand the need to save money,especially in today's economy, but he is always talking of savings, etc. and now he mentions that he isn't allowed to spend money, as little as $5.00.    i have read all of the dave ramsey, and i get it....but even dave ramsey allows for some use of cash.    i just can't imagine being a 41 year old - professional person - who isn't allowed to spend $5.00!is that a normal (and as i told him - if it works, good for you), way to handle finances in a relationship?    my husband and i budget, but we have an amount that we are comfortable to spend without accounting to each other - at least for lunch once a week.what is your opinion?
1707,my 22 months son started working about two weeks ago.    i would like to know if he is at risk    of autism because he just say few words.    he like to play and moves his hands a lot.    he will be also dancing and shaking his whole body sometime without music.    he will hold himself with a chair and will checking his whole body.    sometime he likes to looks at his hands not for a lomg time.    he has ejes contact but not that much.    he also will respond when we call him only when he wants to.    he will not point to things; but he look at me when he need something.    i will say he is shy but i am not sure.    i also concern because when he is watching tv; he is to concentrated.    i took him about 4 months ago to apediatric neurology    and he say that he had a developmental delay.     i think little by little is improving.    at the time he was born my daughter was a 11/2 and i did not spend a lot of time with my baby.    i feed him give him a bath and used to sleep a lot.    after 3 months i had a postpartum depression which i think did not help him because i felt sick and depress until he was probably 8 months.    please give any suggestion. thanksthis discussion is related tomy 22 month old...possible autism or asperger's syndrome?.

1713,i am a 29 year old working female from new delhi, india. i have myopia since i was 6, and at present it is -6.00 in the left, and -12.00 in the right,with cyindrical powers in both. a few years back i got my eyes examined to be cosidered for a lasik refractive surgery from the biggest goverment hospital in india (as some of my friends with high myopia were deceived into lasik surgery and are now in trouble.) such practices are common in india. that is why i chose to consult doctors in aiims, and the doctors there rightfully informed me against lasik as an option as my cornea lacked the required thickness. a very reputed doctor told me that iol implants are not a very safe alternative as the long term contraindications are not yet known. i want to get rid of my glasses and want to know a safe alternative. can i consider iol? please guide me through and also if you know of a good eye surgeon in india. further, does iol cause any trouble during childbirth? for how long should have i discontinued using soft contact lenses before an iol implant?this discussion is related tovery high myopia.

1717,i am a bit concerned.it all started over three months ago with tingling on my right shoulder, my left knee down, left arm (elbow down), back of the neck (at times) and tailbone area.    headaches are pretty much a daily occurance (at time i would explain them to be migraines). i've had some leg pain in my left leg, almost as if it feels like it's been worked out a bit too much (although, i don't work out).    i have blurred vision periodically throughout the day. i tire very easily, two hours after i wake up i feel exhausted and need a nap. increased visual floaters.    i seem to get into these spells where i feel like i am in a complete daze, perhaps what they call brain fog. now, the most recent i've noticed is different sized pupils (periodically throughout the day). the list goes on.my initial research led me to beleive that i have ms considering it started with vertigo and tingling.    i have seen a neuro and all tests came back normal including my mri tons of blood work all came back normal no signs of inflammation.    the only test that came back a bit iffy was my cortisol levels i was on the very low end of the normal scale.do you think the most recent symptom (different sized pupils) is a cause for concern?here is what my mri report said:brain mri results:clinical information: patient describes headaches, mild dizziness, blurred vision with numbness and tingling in the lower back, left upper extremity and left lower extremity.technical information: sagital flair, axial t2, axial proton density, axial flair, axial t1 post-gadolinium, and diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain was performed.    during the emamination, omniscan 12cc was administered.interpretation: mr imaging of the brain reveals three punctate foci of long tr signals abnormality within the left frontal lobe subcortial white matter as seen on series 4, images 3 and series 6, image 19.    phase artifact is superimposed over the left tempral lobe.    mild symmetric hyperintensity marginates the anterior and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles attributed to failed csf suppression.    prominent perivascular spaces are present withn th eanterior perforated substnce. no corpus callosal periventricular radiating lesions characteristic of a demyelinating process are identified.    there are no enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma to suggest and active infammatory process.    thereis no abnormal intrcranial mass or mass effect.    the cerebral sulci appear symmetric and age appropriate.    the ventricals are not dilated.    the basal and cisterns are not effaced.    flow voids are present within the cavernous carotids and vertebrobasilar system.    the cerebellar tonsils are not low lying. a retension cyst is present with the lateral recess of the left phenoid sinus.conclusion:1. three nonspecific punctate foci of long tr signal abnormality within the left frontal lobe white matter.2. no evidence of acute/subacute infarct.3. no abnormal intercranial mass or mass effect.4. a rentention cyst within the lateral recess of the left sphenoid sinus.cervical spine mri results:conclusion:1. no abnormal signal or enhancement within the cervical cord to suggest a demyelinating process.2. mild multilevel degenerative disc disease in the mid and lower cervical spine without critical degenerative spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.3. no facet arthropathy.
1718,my blind spot now has a visible shadow in it. its mostly visible on bright walls and it expands as i move my eyes it either gets large or grows longer, i blink and it goes away. i went to a retinal specialist and a optometrist the optometrist first took a look into my eye dialated my pupils and said he saw no blood and my eyes looked healthy. he said i had a small astigmatism and that was it.he said i needed no glasses not near sighted. or far sighted. he referred me to a retinal specialist who gave me a field exam and took an extensive look into my eye. he saw nothing as well and said it was healthy, i told him i have a few floaters and he said it was nothing.what could this shadow in my natural blind spot be?

1720,hi: i had a root canal done in november on upper front molar.    i went back january 3rd for follow-up and told dentist my tooth was very sensitive still.    went back again on january 17th, and they re-cleaned everything out and found a 4th canal.    at this time, they temporarily attached my new crown.    it is now january 31st, and my tooth feels no better than it did in november.    it is not sensitive to hot and cold, but it is sensitive to touch (pressing my tongue on it), and it is definitely sensitive to chewing.    i am going back to the dentist in march, but i sure would like another person's thoughts about what is happening.    thank you for your consideration.

1723,my 4 year old son named will has begun having a hard time keeping his hands to himself and during disagreements actually gets physical with other children (boys). since he moved into pre-k he has been a very well behaved, participative child. this is a new development in the last 2 weeks.    is this a normal occurance at his age?    how should we respond as parents. we have spoken to him a number of times,    stating the rules at school, and used time out. we have also taken away privilages (1 being wii, which we allow him to play 1/2 hr. a day). we wrestle sometimes at home and play sports. thankspat and terry
1724,hi,my name is jade, i am 30 years old and is on my 32nd week of    pregnancy. this is my first pregnancy. i had my cas on my 20th week and they found a choroid plexus cyst on the left part of the brain. my ob-sonologist recommended that we do a follow up scan every 2 weeks to monitor the cyst. on my 30th week, the choroid plexus cyst was gone but she found that the baby has an enlarged cisterna magna instead in the left. there are no other anomalies found. i also underwent biophysical score for my baby and the same result was found - enlarged cisterna magna. i tried to check the internet what this means because this was not fully discussed by my ob-gynecologist. i am now worried because most explanations i read about enlarged cisterna magna relates it to high risk of trisomy 18, 13 and hydrocephalus and a high risk of fetal mortality. ultrasound result showed that i am conceiving a baby boy. i also had premature contractions recently so i had to be in complete bed rest.can you please enlighten me about this. what are the chances that my child would survive, or would be normal?thanks a lot.worried mom,jade

1727,i just had sex with a guy whose penis is larger than i'm used to, it was a little uncomfortable while doing it because i felt like it didn't fit right, and afterwards i started bleeding. it's not a lot of blood but it's enough to have to wear a pantie liner. i'm not sure if it's just because it was too big or too rough or if something is wrong. help? :/
1728,my son (4 years old / 5 in feb) has be exhibiting what i consider to be serious behavioural issues for the past 3 months.    my mother moved in with us this year as a result of my separation from my husband (father of my son).    it has been a year of great changes and up until about june, very traumatic events involving our separation (father was in and out of jail / mental health hospitals plus restraining orders from both myself and his pre-school against my ex).    adding the fact that my son went from going to a very good pre-school full time where he bonded strongly with his teacher to starting half day jk in a different school.this issues are that he doesn't sleep enough, goes to bed at 7:30pm and even though he stays in bed and usually doesn't get up in the middle of the night - he always has dark circles under his eyes and tells us that he lies awake in bed for a long time.    he has been hitting children at school (teacher says that it is never out of anger, more out of boredom) he has been throwing tantrums at home with myself and my mom.    he says things like he doesn't want to live with us anymore and that he hates us and screams and cries emotionally when asked to do the simplest of things (put boots on, go to the bathroom, eat your vegetables etc..).    he is a very articulate and bright boy with an wide volabulary and advanced comprehensive skills according to his teachers and what we experience.    until this year, he was always very calm and easy.    he never expresses that he wants to see his father and i do encourage him to talk about him and when he does it is always in a matter-of-fact way ie..that's dad's book - dad's really tall etc...    never in an emotional way.    he has started to lie aswell.    for instance if i ask him if he has gone to the bathroom or if he drew the picture or had help etc...i am very concerned.    my mother has stated that if things don't improve soon that she will not be able to look after him anymore.    she cries almost everyday and so does he.    he expresses great regret after he says those things to us and he can be extremely caring and affectionate and has a great sense of humour.do you feel that this is a result of his age or a build up of all that has happened this year?    i am afraid to add even more change in his life by introducing a specialist if this is simply normal.how can i and my mom help him?concerned momchriscam
1729,hello,my 9 year old daughter is jealous of her grandma- my mum- and this is the main reason why they don't really have a relationship. my mum lives abroad and came to visit for 3 months - living with us and she has gone back for one week and is coming back for another 3 months as my husband is in hospital and this will help me so | can go back to work etc...my daughter is always comparing how much time i spend with my mum and how much time i spend with her and no matter what i do it always seems to her that i am always spending time with my mum. what it actually is is that i am always doing something that needs to be done and then i am tired so i don't spend that much time with my daughter but i dont spend any more time with my mum either.i try to encourage my daughter to be positive and enthusiastic about the times we all spend together but i also make sure she has time just with me. but all she seems to remember is the time i went for a walk with our dog and my mum - but she doesnt remember that she didnt want to come because it is boring...how do i get through to her that there is no need to be jealous and on top of everything else jealous of her own grandma...my daughter is an only child and was jealous when we first got some small pet gerbils - when we used to watch them and spend time with them she though we love them more than her.we got a dog 5 months ago and there was the same problem, she was jealous of the dog because of the time i spend walking the dog etc, praising at the begining whilst training, she only recently accepted the dog and actually enjoys having her now even though she doesnt really want to go for walks still.my husband has only been in hospital for 2 weeks and will probably stay there for another 4 weeks so the jealousy problem has nothing to do with it.has anybody got any ideas that could help, please?
1730,hi, i wanted to know if it is possible (even if it comes with stress or anything) for a man not to masturbate during months (and, of course, not have dreams at night and waking up wet), medically speaking? in other words, is 'celibate' a myth or something possible?
1731,my boyfriend and i have been together for just over 1   yrs. things for the most part are good, but there are a couple things that have been nagging at me  and i  d like some other perspectives. we rarely; if ever fight but there have been a few times where something he has done upsets me or hurts my feelings. in several instances where i was upset or hurt, i have had a hard time getting a response or i get an unsatisfying response.    here are a couple snippets of the type of things i am talking about:scenario #1         lisa   a friend from past reconnects with him via    facebook, a few weeks later, i find out myself that she has been calling him 3-4 nights a week, while he is on his way to work. i ask about it  he says yes she has been calling  he did not realize it has been that much  she seems lonely, just talking, there  s nothing there  me: why does she only call on the way to work then? no response  me: why has this never been mentioned to me?   it seemed like she was kinda looking for more and i thought you would be upset    me: heavy sarcasm no ****!! why didn  t you put a stop to it if you thought she wanted more?...  well i knew there was nothing there for me, so i did not think it was a big deal to talk to her  . this situation had me in knots  i did not understand it when it happened and i do not understand it now. it made me feel vulnerable and insecure and i lost some confidence in the relationship and to be honest my guy. he thinks it was only an issue because i am insecure and lack confidence, that most women would not have been so upset. to me it was the first chink in the armor, to this point i was not having doubts  they continued to talk although less often and exchange occasional texts, even though they both knew how i felt about it  flash forward a couple months  we are on vacation   lisa   see  s pictures on facebook  sends a text, which he shows me  looks like you are having fun  if you love her(me), why haven  t you married her yet? he does not respond  i am crushed(not that i was expecting him to say he was going to marry me, just something  cause to me she was asking him a question, that question being should i just leave you alone and move on, and he left it open. i do not know if they are still talking occasionally or not.scenario #2    at a party outside, i am sitting in a chair he is standing behind me   tina   is beside him, 4 different times i turn to look at him and she is rubbing her hands up and down his backside  neither of them know i am seeing this  i did not say anything then   tina   is much bigger than i, had a few drinks and is known to be hot-headed. on the way home, me: so i seen   tina   rubbing you.   yeah she was pretty drunk   me: why didn  t you walk away?   didn  t seem like a big deal, a little drunk flirting is all   me: really?   well if i had known you seen it, i would have done something about it   me: wtf, is that supposed to make it better?, what if i hadn  t been there at all? what if it had been someone besides tina, that was more attractive and that you liked more(tina is rather unpleasant in many aspects)?   why are you always looking for something that isn  t there, it  s like you don  t trust me at all?  obviously there was a lot more said, but this should give the general idea. to me both of these things should have been stopped by him, seems to me his lack of a response is a response (not to me, but to tina and lisa). if it were me i would be thinking well, he hasn  t told me to stop or walked away, or given me any reason to believe he doesn  t want me to keep on doing, whatever it is they are doing  am off base on this? does this just sound to you like i am being jealous and insecure, because that is what he thinks  but these things truly hurt me, and i don  t feel like they are a result of me being insecure, but that i am insecure as a result of these instances. do i need to lighten up? he really feels like he wasn  t doing anything wrong and he is not big on confrontation or hurting people  s feelings  but what about my feelings? what gives?
1732,its neally a year since i had a full hysterectomy and my stomach is still bloating,can anyone recommend some exercises i can do to help.
1733,my daughter has had vision differences between her two eyes all of her life.    one eye was 20/20 and the other eye was 20/800.    her bad eye shut off and she really only was able to see out of her one eye.    her eye never wanders.    we tried various non-surgical treatments when she was small but none of them worked.    is there anything that can be done at this point?    she is 22.    someone had told me that because her eye muscles were never used, that they would not work at this point even if she had laser surgery.    is this true?
1734,ok , so ive been on bontril for about 4 days now ... just wonder is there anyone out there that has taking this med . and any good feed back.
1735,well, another week has gone and it's time to see where we are all at.i am sorry to say that i'm up 2 lbs this week.a few weeks ago, my pcp freaked out at my thyroid levels and insisted on decreasing my med dosage, even though i begged him not to do it. i stayed on my old dosage until i ran out of it and it only took a couple of weeks on the new, lower dose to mess me up completely.    i did see my endo, on friday and when i explained to him what had happened, he increased my dosage to where it should be and i'm hopeful that it won't take long to get back to where i was.in the meantime, i'm on christmas break for the next 2 weeks and i see no reason why i can't hit the exercise mat on a daily basis to at least keep from going up any more and hopefully to drop some weight.okay -- now it's your turn.............
1736,i have a 7 month old. he has a problem with sitting down entertaining himself. i can never get work done around the house, and no one will keep him. i also have a 2 year old and i barely ever have time to sit and teach him new things because i am always holding my youngest. sometimes it seems like my 2 yr old is feeling left out.    what can i do. i have tried letting my 7 month old cry but i think its harder for me than him.

1740,43 percent of women suffer from sexual dysfunctiondear friend,these days, you can hardly walk by a television without seeing an ad for viagra, cialis, or any of the other ed drugs. (ed is the politically correct way of saying erectile dysfunction.) and because there is a long and now widely known laundry list of sexual woes for men, many assume that only men suffer from sexual dysfunction (sd).however, nothing could be further from the truth.according to a new study conducted by massachusetts general hospital, women not only suffer from sd, but there is a far higher percentage of women sd sufferers. shocked? well, don't be.while 31 percent of the men in this survey admitted to dealing with at least one kind of sd, a staggering 43 percent of the women surveyed reported that they also wrestled with their own sexual issues. these problems included painful intercourse, a decline of sexual desire, and an inability to achieve orgasms.ready for a bigger shock: just 12 percent of the women who admitted that they suffered from these problems said that the issues caused them any distress.according to the leader of the study, dr. jan shifren, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at massachusetts general, sexual problems are common in women, but problems associated with personal distress, those which are truly bothersome and affect a woman's quality of life, are much less frequent.the survey polled 32,000 women from across america, aged between 18 to over 100. and, if you ask me, the massive age difference in the sample group takes a bit of the shock out of the idea that 43 percent of women are suffering from sexual dysfunction.indeed, the breakdown of the statistics bear my theory out: of those surveyed, it was women over the age of 65 who had the highest incidence of sd, but this same group also reported having the lowest level of distress as a result of their sd. should we be shocked that women between the age of 65 and 100    who, let's face it, probably aren't having too much sex to begin with    aren't too worried that they've got some degree of sexual dysfunction?and, as if to underscore what i'm sure would be another widely held assumption, it was the women in the youngest age group (from 18 to 44) who reported the lowest levels of both sd and distress from sd. again    i'm just not shocked by this.if the goal of the research was to reinforce many of the preconceptions about women's sexuality, then i believe the study succeeded. they determined 1) younger women are less likely to have sd. 2) women in middle age (from 45 to 64), the time when the body begins to change, had the highest degree of stress resulting from sd. 3) older women have more sd, but it doesn't really bother them.i think i could've told you that without compiling a survey from 32,000 women.dr. d

1743,my 5 year old son wets his bed every night. washing sheets every day does no good if his mattress is soaking...and he tears up the plastic liners you can put under the fitted sheet...even if it was in place, i'd still be washing every single day. i'm beyond frustrated at this point, and every answer is take him to the dr....he admits to waking up needing to go, but stays in bed, pees, and falls back asleep in it, says he's too scared to get out of bed. we have nightlights everywhere! i'm losing my mind...someone, please tell me what to tell this kid to make him knock it off!!!!!
1744,i didn't research this vaccine and now am hearing about all of these complications and death associated with gardasil. my 14 year old daughter has received two of the three shots. what happens if i choose not to give her the third shot, because at this point i absolutely do not want her to have it. i am worried that this vaccine, being as it hasn't been tested properly or time tested that it may have long term effects. what if i chose for her to have this vaccine and later she is unable to have children? or it causes some other complication? you know i didn't allow her to have the varicella shot (hoping that she would finally get chicken pox), but finally had to give it to her because it is required for a military family. i fought against that vaccine so long, i feel horrible that i dropped the ball on this one and just got pressured into it. they didn't even properly explain what its for, i didn't know its for stds, i did wonder why it wasn't offered to my age group, i even asked but got a non answer. anyway, any help would be appreciated....worriedmom74this discussion is related togardasil side effects.

1750,so with all the talk about various states passing laws around illegal immigration, i started to think about a cnn documentary i saw a month of so ago.    it profiled and talked to children of illegal immigrants who were born in the us.    these were good kids, all getting ready for college, and the focus was on whether or not they should be allowed to stay or deported along with their parents (if deportation was in fact the final decision).    all these kids knew was the us and they just wanted to go to college and make something of themselves (again, these were the kids interviewed,).    most had never even visited the country of their parents birth.    i was wondering what others thought...should those kids be allowed to stay, or should they also be deported?

1756,i have a 2yr old daughter that goes to bed fine but she will not sleep thru the night. sometimes she gets up upto 5 times during the night. i feel like i've tried everything, i just want to be able to sleep myself. she's not moody or anything    because of lack of sleep even now that i've cut out naps. but it just seems as if nothing helps. i'm at a stalling point i don't know what to do anymore so any suggestions are welcome. would love to try something different and hopefully find a solution to this problem.
1757,i had a rezoom lens surgery for cataract in my left eye two weeks ago. i am 54 years old in good health. i had atropine drops for three days to dialate my eye prior to surgery. it took over a 8 days for my eye dialation to normalize. my surgeion told me that everything went well but my vision is not acceptable. many posts say that they can see distance, intermediate, and close fine right after surgery.    at this time on the eye chart i can read 20/20 but i am looking through a fog. it is like there is a ghost like image with a sharper edge, almost like a double image. interediate vision is problematic. in the opthalolgist office i can read but it is really blurry however with the ability to read at almost 20/30.    does this make sense.    the halos at night are not complely circular and not as intense with both eyes as if i cover my right eye. i seems that i can not focus my lens eye except at far distance in daylight like driving. if i had to depend on my new lens eye only i would not be able to read or do anything short of far away vision which is more clear but not a bright a picture as my non lens eye. trying to use a computer screen or see intermediate or read even large print especially under floresent lighting is poor even though the opthalogist keeps putting me off by saying  you are doing fine, you are healing, you can read the eye chart better than before the surgery. you are over critical you must have patience    am i nuts or the fact that i am concerned about the poor quality of my vision and want to know what i am experiencing and what it may be is it too much to ask. the letters reading seem to all mush together but have some sharpness.... does that make sense.    does my brain have to catch up because it seems that except for far vision i can not really focus at all. what do i ask, what could be going on or is this the norm.    help

1760,hello,as stated in my earlier post last year, my daughter has cylindrical power, however after wearing glasses now nearly for more than a year, her cylindrical power has reduce from -2.5 (both eyes) to -1.5 (right) and -0.5 (left). however she does have starbismus when she wakes up from her sleep for say 5 minutes and when she is extremely tired. we have been patching her eyes for the past 8 months.yes, definitely she has a fair control and adjusts her eyes when she is out from the sleepy mode and when she is active seldom do we see signs of starbismus. like a therapy, she is now prescribed glasses with an additional spherical power (artificial), so that she can adjust her eyes quickly. my questions are:1. how long does she need to wear glasses?2. how long do we need to continue patching? also, what is the reason that she has the starbismus only when she is tired?3. does she require any kind of surgery in this regard and can it be cured completely over a span of time?thanks & regardmaverickthis discussion is related tocylindrical eye power for 2 year old kid.
1761,open to all ideas!39/f. sudden onset in november, 2006...started seeing trails behind moving objects. by feb., i developed severe photophobia with eye pain...which invariably led to a killer brain freeze headache above my brow. a couple months later, i noticed several dark spots and squiggles in my vision. they've been multiplying to the point they're really distracting in day to day life. by summer, i developed occasional flashes and streaks in my peripheral vision. all of the above mentioned complaints have continued 24/7 to this day. this week, i noticed the air seems electrified, or slightly shimmering...as if my sight is just too good. i feel like time is running out for my sight...or my sanity (i think i'm allergic to pain)....which led me to mad-crazed googling...which eventually led me here.about my medical history....i've been checked by a neurologist, ophtalmologist, neuro-ophtalmologist, and back to a neurologist. all findings are normal including eye exam (20/20), eeg, and mri. diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid disease (post-partum thyroiditis and/or hashimotos depending on which dr you ask) and, what i would describe as a life long blah...whatever....i'm exhausted and just want to sleep disorder. the latest neurologist thinks i have a degenerative autoimmune eye disease that effects the retina. and...she's pretty sure i have lyme disease. another dr. is sure it's lead poisoning and/or lyme. many new dr. appts in the next couple of weeks with many more test results.

1765,recently my right eye has been tearing.    at times it is so bad that the tear rolls down my cheek.    i have just seen a contact lens specialist and he said this was caused by blepharitis.    could this be true since i have blepharitis in the left eye as well and it isn't watery    i'm using hot compresses and steri-lid, but it doesn't seem to help.    do you have any suggestion to help get rid of the tears?    thanks.
1766,http://news.yahoo.com/republican-party-seems-divided-angry-ever-140632093--election.htmlinfighting has penetrated the highest levels of the house gop leadership. long-standing geographic tensions have increased, pitting endangered northeastern republicans against their colleagues from other parts of the country. enraged tea party leaders are threatening to knock off dozens of republicans who supported a measure that raised taxes on the nation's highest earners.people are mad as hell. i'm right there with them, amy kremer, chairman of the tea party express, said late last week, declaring that she has no confidence in the party her members typically support. her remarks came after gop lawmakers agreed to higher taxes but no broad spending cuts as part of a deal to avert the fiscal cliff.anybody that voted 'yes' in the house should be concerned about primary challenges in 2014, she said.why is she not concerned about her own position in 2014???

nation could control american land as   development zones  (dr. jerome r. corsi)    could real estate on american soil owned by china be set up as   development zones   in which the communist nation could establish chinese-owned businesses and bring in its citizens to the u.s. to work?that  s part of an evolving proposal beijing has been developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of u.s debt it owns into equity.special: bypass the lame stream media! expose the truth about   america  s fraud president   to unlimited households!under the plan, china would own u.s. businesses, u.s. infrastructure and u.s. high-value land, all with a u.s. government guarantee against loss.yu qiao, a professor of economics in the school of public policy and management at tsighua university in beijing, proposed in 2009 a plan for the u.s. government to guarantee foreign investments in the united states.wnd has reliable information that the bank of china, china  s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert china  s holdings of u.s. debt into equity owned by china in the u.s.the obama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for china to convert u.s. debt into chinese direct equity investment. china would take ownership of successful u.s. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value u.s. real estate.the plan would be designed to induce china to resume lending to the u.s. on a nearly zero-interest basis.however, converting chinese debt to equity investments in the united states could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding obama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.as of november 2012, china owned $1.17 trillion in u.s. treasury securities, according to u.s. department of treasury and federal reserve board calculations published jan. 16.concerned about the unrestrained growth in u.s. debt under the obama administration, china has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term u.s. treasury bills. china  s holding of $573.7 billion in august 2008, prior to the massive bank bailouts and stimulus programs triggered by the collapse in the u.s. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by march 2011.treasury bills are short-term debt that matures in one year or less, sold to finance u.s. debt. holdings of treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total treasury securities owned by china as of november 2012.in addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the u.s. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfunded obligations, including social security and medicare benefits scheduled to be paid retiring baby boomer retirees in the coming decades, with unfunded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.yu qiao observed that if the u.s. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed obama administration trillion-dollar budget deficits into the foreseeable future, holders of u.s. debt would face substantial losses that the financial times estimated   would devastate asians   hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.    the basic idea is to turn asian savings, china  s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support u.s. over-consumption,   yu qiao wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by chinese government officials.   while fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,   he continued.the problem is that, in a struggling u.s. economy, china does not want to trade its investment in u.s. treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar devaluation, for equally risky investments in u.s. corporations and infrastructure projects.  but asians do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in u.s. businesses,   he stressed.   however if a guarantee scheme were created, asian savers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry u.s. industries.  yu qiao  s plan included four components:china would negotiate with the u.s. government to create a   crisis relief facility,   or crf. the crf   would be used alongside u.s. federal efforts to stabilize the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from boston to washington, d.c.china would pool a portion of its holdings of treasury bonds under the cfr umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. any cfr funds that were designated for investment in u.s. corporations would still be owned and managed by u.s. equity holders, with the asians holding minority equity shares   that would, like preferred stock, be convertible.  the u.s. government would act as a guarantor,   providing a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the crf against possible default of targeted companies or projects  .the federal reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the crf would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the united states.  the crf would lessen asians   concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,   yu qiao concluded.   it would cost little and help the u.s. by channeling funds to business investment.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776nation.comjerome r.

1775,(reuters) - rock star. novelty. myth-buster. surprise.that's how some pundits describe mia love, a republican congressional nominee in utah who is upending stereotypes about the state and its predominant faith. a rising star and mayor of a small utah city, she will have a brief prime-time speaking role on tuesday at the republican convention.love, 36, is a black mormon in a deeply conservative state where her race makes up less than 3 percent of the population. if she bests the popular, right-of-center democratic incumbent, jim matheson, in november, love would be the first black, conservative woman elected to the u.s. house of representatives, although polls show she faces an uphill battle.i believe our country is in big trouble, said love, also a runner who teaches fitness classes. if i can make a difference, not only should i do it, it's my obligation as a parent and an american.in 2010, she was the first black woman elected as mayor of a utah city. she's also a first-generation u.s. citizen whose parents immigrated to new york from haiti in the 1970s in search of the american dream and who wanted to make sure their daughter contributed to society.love, a mother of three, says she's running against six-term incumbent matheson in the newly created 4th district in central utah to do just that. matheson represents utah's 2nd district and opted to run in the 4th after redistricting scattered his constituents.that love captured the republican nomination was a surprise both in and out of utah. a tea party darling, she is now seen as representing the strongest chance in a decade for republicans to push matheson, the lone democrat in utah's congressional delegation and a fellow mormon, out of office.'a wild card'little-known outside of saratoga springs, a farming hamlet turned city of 18,000 about 35 miles south of salt lake city, love leap-frogged over a crowded field including two better-known state lawmakers to snag the nomination with over 70 percent of the vote at the state republican convention in april.utah political insiders chalked up her victory to a confluence of events, including infighting between two front-runners and an engaging speech by love that hit all the right notes for the traditionally conservative delegates.she champions limited government, fiscal discipline, personal responsibility and state's rights. she's pro-gun and holds a concealed weapon permit, opposes abortion and has said she would favor dismantling the federal departments of energy and education.she also supports utah's effort to reclaim public lands from federal agency controls and would vote against regulations she believes would restrict economic development.she was clearly a wild card, matthew burbank, a university of utah political science professor, said. she's not all that different in the sense of her political views and her being a member of the majority religion. on the other hand, she does have a life story that is different than anybody i can think of in utah politics.love has the backing of the national republican congressional committee, which has given her campaign nearly $1 million for fall television ads.i have never had a problem with people calling me a shiny new toy, but hopefully it's what i stand for that matters, love said. i was elected as mayor with 60 percent of the vote, and it wasn't because i'm black and i'm female.republican senator john mccain of arizona and house speaker john boehner have campaigned for love in utah. former secretary of state condoleezza rice is due to appear at a utah event on september 7.ann romney, wife of republican presidential contender mitt romney, has endorsed love, as has romney's running mate, paul ryan. but national support, or even her speaking role at the republican convention, may not help love gain enough ground to win.a recent poll conducted for salt lake city media outlets the deseret news and ksl television found she trailed the race 53 percent to 38 percent.focus on racestill, there's no question that love's race is part of what's drawing the attention of party leaders, said lavar webb, a longtime salt lake city-based republican strategist.they wouldn't discuss this publicly, but the fact that a black woman could be elected in utah i think would signal that (the state) is more diverse and open-minded and cosmopolitan than people believe, webb said.matheson, the son of utah's last democratic governor, has held his seat because he's viewed as a moderate who breaks party lines to vote with republicans on issues that align with utah's more conservative values, pundits said.matheson, however, disagreed that love offers voters anything dramatically different from past challengers.i don't think most utahns want to get rid

1776,hello,my nephew who is 18month now vomits excessivly.it has been that way since birth.    he vomits anytime but mostly after eating. we have gone to the doctor and they say there is nothing wrong with him and diagnoise him with gerd.    we don't over feed him at all he eat small meal every two to three hours and we make sure he sits up for a least an hour after eating but he still vomits and he becomes very tired after a vomiting episode. i just found out last week that his uncle who is about 30+ and the uncle father has the same issue.    they have tried everthing but they still vomit.is there any genitc disorder this might be linked to?
1777,i am extremely myopic (my doctor says i have pathological myopia in both eyes).    my left eye has a pretty bad macular hole and i also have severe cataracts in the left eye (on the scale of 1 - 4, mine is a 3).    i've been to two retinal specialists, one who said that i should have the cataract surgery first and then have the retinal surgery to repair the hole, 2 weeks later.    the other said that she would do the retinal surgery first.    i am reluctant to have the retinal surgery at all, thinking that i might just live with the macular hole.    however, i was thinking that having the cataract surgery might help improve my vision, even by just a little bit.    my cataract surgeon told me it would be useless, the improvement being only so slight that i would hardly notice the difference.    he also said that because i am so severely myopic, the cataract surgery would increase the likelihood of future retinal detachments and might even worsen the macular hole or create some new retinal problems.    why do cataract surgery for such small returns?    he will only do the cataract surgery if i agree to follow it up with retinal surgery.    what do you think?this discussion is related tomacular hole repair success rate.

1781,for he past 3wks my 8yr old daughter has been crying 4-5times a day but can't explain why. she says she doesn't know why. i have asked her every question i could possibly think of to come up with a reason but she says no to them all. i asked her those questions when she was not actively crying because when i tried asking while she was crying she would think maybe thats it & be ok until a few hours later when it would hit her again. i believe she honestly doesn't know why this is happening to her. i can't stand seeing my baby girl like this. do you have any ideas that can help me?
1782,ever since i was younger i have hated my vaginal area. i always felt like there was something wrong with me and that i was ugly down there. my labia are longer, and just ugly. i am now in my late teens and my period has been messing up. i need to be put on birth control for that and sexual reasons. only one person ( my boyfriend of many years ) has seen me naked since i was very young and i am terrified to get put on the pill, because of the pap. i am afraid the doctor will tell me something is wrong with me, or tell me i have an ugly vagina or something of that region. i do not know what to do. this is probably my greatest fear.

1788,good morning, ladies and gentlemen:well, here we are, with yet another week gone by.     are we having fun yet??at any rate, this is the day of the week that we do our weigh in, and discuss our success or set back.    i'm happy to say that i am down 0.4 lbs this week -- wonder if it's the same 0.4 lbs i lost a couple of weeks ago.......lol     seems that i lose and regain the same pounds over and over.    if i could keep off all the pounds i've lost, i would probably be about right.oh well, a loss is a loss and i'll take it. i did have a very busy week at work, so no time to get bored and convince myself that i was starving; also no time to stop at the convenience store to buy potato chips!!    in addition to that, being very busy, meant that i was physically active, so got exercise as well.    on thurs, i had to load, transport and unload approx 40 cases of bottled water (24 - 16.9 oz bottles/case) so i even got in my weight training.thursday was the last of the grueling 10 hr days i've been working all summer; so beginning tomorrow will go back to regular 8 hr days.    on tues, i see my endo and hope to get an increase in my thyroid med; hoping between the shorter days and med increase, i will get back to feeling somewhat human again, which in turn will leave me with time and energy to get back on my exercise routine.okay, it's your turn.    did you have success or set back?    if you were successful, did you do something different that worked better for you?    if so, please let us know - might be something we can all find useful.    if you had a set back, again, did you do something different, that might not have worked out for you?    please let us know what we can do to help get you back on track.there is no such thing as failure - only set backs.
1789,i am a 21 year old male. for the past two months i have been experiencing redness/inflammation on the head of my penis as well as the skin directly beneath the head. it is extremely sensitive all day and sore constantly, although worse at times. in the last year i have only had sexual contact with my long time partner and 2 other girls. when the symptoms began i was tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and bacterial infections, all clean. i was put on doxycycline for 10 days with no improvement. i then went and saw a urologist who put me on ciprofloxacin for 30 days, with no improvement. i went back to the same urologist and he prescribed mupirocin ointment for a week, no improvement. i went back to my original doctor who said it may be fungal and so told me to try lotrimin or monestat. i tried both with no improvement, then i was given 2 doses of diflucan which also did not help at all. i went and saw a dermatologist who told me it may be psoriasis and to try hydrocortisone ointment which has not helped either. i also have switched to hypoallergenic detergent and soap and all cotton underwear. i am beginning to seriously lose hope that anyone will be able to tell me what is wrong or how to fix it. the redness comes and goes, but it becomes very deep red and inflamed if i masturbate or have sex or even just have an erection. i have been told it is certainly not herpes by every single doctor due to it being constant for two months and there not being lesions but i am still fearful that this may be what it is. can anyone tell me if this could possibly be herpes? has anyone had similar problems or have any idea what the problem may be or how to fix it? any insights or advice would be extremely appreciated, this whole thing is a nightmare and i am praying i find a solution soon!

1791,when oj dies...i don't care what your politics are ..... this is funny!!one day in the future, oj simpson has a heart-attack and dies.he immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him.'i don't know what to do here,' says the devil.'you are on my list, but i have no room for you.you definitely have to stay here, so i'll tell you what i'm going to do.i've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.i'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place.i'll even let you decide who leaves.'oj thought that sounded pretty good,so the devil opened the door to the first room.in it was ted kennedy and a large pool of water..ted kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed.over, and over, and over he dove in and surfaced with nothing.such was his fate in hell.'no,' oj said. 'i don't think so.i'm not a good swimmer, and i don't think i could do that all day long.'the devil led him to the door of the next room.in it was george w. bush with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks.all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.'no, this is no good; i've got this problem with my shoulder.i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks allday,' commented oj.the devil opened a third door.through it, oj saw bill clinton ,lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrainedin a spread-eagle pose.bent over him was monica lewinsky , doing what she does best.oj looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said,'yeah man, i can handle this.'the devil smiled and said . . . .. .(this is priceless)'ok, monica, you're free to go.'
1792,i have had hives on my legs, all below my knees for about a month and a half now.    my allergist said it was something called vesticularitis dont know if that is spelled right or not.    he gave me prednisone to take for about 2 weeks and said they would go away.    i'm off the medication now and they are still there.    they are only on my shins, and not anywhere above my knees.    i talked to my primary care doc and they said they didn't know what to tell me.this is really scaring me because i don't know what this is.    my allergist told me if they didn't go away or if they came back then i might have some sort of disease.    my follow up appt with my allergist isn't until july.these hives don't itch, burn, or have any side affects.    they are just there.    after taking prednisone they became less red, now they are darker.    i have never had anything like this before.i want these to go away because they make my legs look horrible.can anyone give me an answer to what is wrong?this discussion is related toankle and leg - red, slightly swollen, hives running up leg.
1793,i am a step away from care. i'm in a relapse of severe cfs. in bed very most of the day. i can obviously get online and i can get to bathroom.. good.. but my mother is cooking for me. i don't even wash up. this doesn't make me feel too good at all.i have been worse but i just don't see the point. i haven't worked for nearly 6 yrs. i used to love working. now i have no commitment to live. neither do i have a commitment to die ot kill myself but i wouldn't mind dying - for lack of hope in the future and cause i'm tired of the illness(es).this is a prayer request and also a bunch of questions if anyone feels like answering.i don't see the purpose of living if suffering and the most i can do is watch telly if well enough. i'm not convinced this is god's best for me, although it's possible!i used to enjoy life, and loved to contribute and help others, often excited about the day.thanks if you have helpful insight. thabks if you can pray. thanks if you can be kind about it. sorry to be conditional.blessings.
1794,i had a chest xray because of a positive ppd. the tb results were negative, but the radiology report said that there is 'mild stenois', 'scarring' and 'pleural thickening left lateral base vs clothing artifact' (the artifact was probably the tie of my gown).    i'm 28, have never been sick other than the normal cold/flu thing, and had a chest xray 5 years ago that had nothing.i'm going to be taking the xray to my doctor once i get my hands on it and get an appointment. in the meantime, should i be concerned? is this an indication of previous damage, or something current, or merely an uncertainty by the radiologist as to whether it was my lung or my clothing?
1795,dutch anti-islam party to have strong voice in next govt(afp)    8 hours agothe hague    dutch anti-islam mp geert wilders will have to be consulted on every decision the next government makes if a provisional agreement on forming a new cabinet reached friday is finalised, an expert said.under the provisional agreement, wilders' party for freedom (pvv) will have no cabinet members but would have a crucial support role, the centre-right vvd, the christian democratic action (cda) and the free-market pvv said in a joint statement.an analyst told afp the agreement would in fact mean wilders having a strong voice in government decisions as he would have to be consulted on each issue.talks on forming a new cabinet ended late friday with further discussions scheduled to firm up the accord from next week.although he will not be in the cabinet, wilders is in a strong bargaining position after the pvv made the biggest gains in june 9 elections -- coming third by raising its number of seats from nine to 24 out of 150 in the dutch parliament.the vvd won with 31 seats, while fellow rightists cda came in fourth with 21 seats -- half its previous total.negotiations to form a coalition involving the vvd and the second biggest party, the labour pvda with 30 seats, failed over disagreements on economic policy.maverick wilders has earned notoriety around the world with his campaign to stop the islamisation of the netherlands.he calls islam a fascist religion, campaigns for the banning of the koran and the burqa, and likens the koran to hitler's mein kampf. he is known abroad for his 17-minute commentary, fitna, which was termed offensively anti-islamic by un chief ban ki-moon.he was barred from entering britain last year to stop him spreading hatred and violent messages.copyright   2010 afp. all rights reserved. more  http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/aleqm5ipful4wdnlhzubeocicprwlxqfka
1796,i have read with much interest and concern regarding the list's interest in how liver disease progresses and how it results.last april (2007), i took some blood tests. i have hep c (since 1994 or before), and i am an alcoholic. my liver, in april, was diagnosed as imminent failure.i work out everyday, as in the past, for about an hour. i am extremely healthy-looking on the outside.as this list is so interested in how liver disease progresses, i would be glad to contribute descriptions of my gradual degradation.to the best of my knowledge, there is only one treatment for hep c. that is interferon. it is a 50% chance of success, with chemotherapy-like implications. in 1994, i declined the treatment. in that year, i had a liver biopsy. while i don't remember what the results showed, i do remember that the doctor told me to do a biopsy every year. i did not.i live a normal life with my wife who is many years younger than myself. she likes going out a lot. i like that too.in april 2007, i took a blood test that caused me to quit drinking/smoking for about 4 months. but, i returned to both.over the past year or so, i've noticed that my urine gets very cloudy. i have no pain, no other symptoms of liver failure. however, cloudy urine is a symptom of liver failure, so i assume my liver situation is worsening. the cloudiness used to take a couple hours to be evident, now, it takes but an hour.while i've not returned for any additional tests, i believe i am in liver failure.i will make an effort to post to the list how i progress with this, if there is interest. i don't plan to change anything in my lifestyle, i am not a transplant kind of guy, so don't expect to heal.if the list members are interested in reading how i progress, please post your expressions of interest to the list. i will respect what responses are received.if any listmember has questions, i will try to answer them.
1797,(cnn) -- arrest warrants have been issued for a southern california couple who may have fled to mexico after authorities found a dead child in their home, a police spokeswoman told cnn tuesday.the bakersfield police department found a 3-year-old girl dead and a 4-year-old boy sleeping in the home sunday morning after responding to a call from the children's aunt.police want to question alberto garcia, 26, and carla garcia, 26, about the child's death and check on the well-being of three other children believed to be accompanying them.we believe they are in a border town, said sgt. mary degeare with the bakersfield police department.police said the garcias were trying to adopt the young children, who were the natural children of carla garcia's sister.police have issued murder and felony child endangerment warrants and are still working on obtaining an unlawful flight warrant through the fbi, degeare said.we want to take them into custody for the murder, but we are more concerned with the children's welfare, she added.the three children believed to still be with the couple have been identified as carlos joe solvalvarro, 9; crystal garcia, 5; and alberto garcia jr., 4. police corrected earlier statements made to cnn that carlos joe solvalvarro, who is carla garcia's child with another man, was 10.carlos solvalvarro, the younger solvalvarro's father, is worried about the safety of his son while he's with his mother and stepfather. solvalvarro told cnn affiliate kbak that he's had tiffs with the stepfather in the past and his ex-wife is short-tempered.the father just likes to pick on smaller people than him, solvalvarro told kbak.the family drives a white 1997 ford expedition. bakersfield police ask anyone with information about the family's whereabouts to call them at 661-327-7111.
1798,one week ago, i began having slight discomfort in my testicles - upon inspection, i also noticed small, flat, red spots on the upper shaft of my penis.    the next day, the pain in my testicles was nearly unbearable, but the spots had faded.    i went to the doctor and he checked me over, gave me a rx for cipro and lortab, and sent me home, saying it was probably a general infection.    over the course of the week, the pain in my testicles would come and go, along with some nausea and an overall sick feeling.    i also noticed that the skin on the upper shaft of my penis seems to be peeling just a little bit.    now, a week later, i have some mild stinging with urination every once in a while, and again have small, red spots on my penis, along with the ever-present testicle pain - no discharge, ever, though.    i plan to return to the doctor tomorrow, but can someone please help me out with this?background:    married for a while and i and my wife have remained faithful.    wife shows no signs.

1802,this was sent to me from tea party..com     trust me they are back, the gun control issue    has brought them out of their holes'     china poised to play debt card    for u.s. landcommunist nation could control american land as   development zones  (dr. jerome r. corsi)    could real estate on american soil owned by china be set up as   development zones   in which the communist nation could establish chinese-owned businesses and bring in its citizens to the u.s. to work?that  s part of an evolving proposal beijing has been developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of u.s debt it owns into equity.special: bypass the lame stream media! expose the truth about   america  s fraud president   to unlimited households!under the plan, china would own u.s. businesses, u.s. infrastructure and u.s. high-value land, all with a u.s. government guarantee against loss.yu qiao, a professor of economics in the school of public policy and management at tsighua university in beijing, proposed in 2009 a plan for the u.s. government to guarantee foreign investments in the united states.wnd has reliable information that the bank of china, china  s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert china  s holdings of u.s. debt into equity owned by china in the u.s.the obama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for china to convert u.s. debt into chinese direct equity investment. china would take ownership of successful u.s. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value u.s. real estate.the plan would be designed to induce china to resume lending to the u.s. on a nearly zero-interest basis.however, converting chinese debt to equity investments in the united states could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding obama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.as of november 2012, china owned $1.17 trillion in u.s. treasury securities, according to u.s. department of treasury and federal reserve board calculations published jan. 16.concerned about the unrestrained growth in u.s. debt under the obama administration, china has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term u.s. treasury bills. china  s holding of $573.7 billion in august 2008, prior to the massive bank bailouts and stimulus programs triggered by the collapse in the u.s. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by march 2011.treasury bills are short-term debt that matures in one year or less, sold to finance u.s. debt. holdings of treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total treasury securities owned by china as of november 2012.in addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the u.s. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfunded obligations, including social security and medicare benefits scheduled to be paid retiring baby boomer retirees in the coming decades, with unfunded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.yu qiao observed that if the u.s. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed obama administration trillion-dollar budget deficits into the foreseeable future, holders of u.s. debt would face substantial losses that the financial times estimated   would devastate asians   hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.    the basic idea is to turn asian savings, china  s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support u.s. over-consumption,   yu qiao wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by chinese government officials.   while fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,   he continued.the problem is that, in a struggling u.s. economy, china does not want to trade its investment in u.s. treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar devaluation, for equally risky investments in u.s. corporations and infrastructure projects.  but asians do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in u.s. businesses,   he stressed.   however if a guarantee scheme were created, asian savers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry u.s. industries.  yu qiao  s plan included four components:china would negotiate with the u.s. government to create a   crisis relief facility,   or crf. the crf   would be used alongside u.s. federal efforts to stabilize the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from boston to washington, d.c.china would pool a portion of its holdings of treasury bonds under the cfr umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. any cfr funds that were designated for investment in u.s. corporations would still be owned and managed by u.s. equity holders, with the asians holding minority equity shares   that would, like preferred stock, be convertible.  the u.s. government would act as a guarantor,   providing a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the crf against possible default of targeted companies or projects  .the federal reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the crf would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the united states.  the crf would lessen asians   concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,   yu qiao concluded.   it would cost little and help the u.s. by channeling funds to business investment.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776nation.comjerome r.

1812,my niece is 13 yrs old.    she is very pretty, bright but mostly she is a sweet, loving young lady.    she is an only child.    since she has been in 8th grade, there are a couple of mean girls - girls that just don't like her for some unknown reason.    i think they are jealous b/c that is usually what happens between girls.    she doesn't get invited to parties that these girls are going to.i think she is too nice and that's part of the problem.    if she fought back, i think they would back down.    my sister-in-law wants her to be all nice-nice and act like it doesn't bother her that these girls are saying mean things.    my niece is a good girl - she doesn't date and my brother & his wife made her cancel her myspace page b/c it was becoming an obsession with her.     some of these mean girls are already having sex with multiple guys.    or they are smoking cigarettes.my question is, is there anything i can tell her to help her deal with this little mean girls?    how can i make her stand up for herself?    i know i should leave it to my brother & wife, but from what i see, she really needs some help and not someone just telling her to be nice to everyone.    i think that attitude is making her a target.    can anyone give me some advice?thanks!
1813,my son's best friend is a criminal.    his own parents sent him to juvie.    my wife sides with my son on this one and has unending forgiveness for my son and his friend.    when he'd thought we'd all gone away on vacation, i stayed back because of work and as a result, i caught this boy breaking and entering into my home red handed.    he also had another guy with him who he helped climb through my window, this other guy was from a different city and was unknown by my son.when i caught them, they were apologetic and begged forgiveness.    i told them i would settle with my son not with them.my almost 18 son can not understand or believe my reaction (he was away on vacation at the time) and he despises me for the sh-t you've put me through because i demanded that my son pay for the broken window and i'd preferred that he beat the money out of his buddy for it too.    he believes he was in another state at the time and therefore had nothing to do with it.    also, my son finds no fault with his friend, only with me for catching him and demanding that my son settle it himself.    he even apologiezed to his buddy for having such as *** for a dad.    they claim they forgot their sunglasses in the house, but i point out that you don't need a crew and broken windows for that.he doesn't understand why i needed him to settle it himself and it has caused major damage to our relationship.    please i don't want to lose my son over something so stupid and yet i can't just let him run with a crowd of criminals either.    did i get this wrong?    what can i do?

1818,i am    50 years old    and i will be having surgery to remove my uterus since its very large and i have several fibroids,i am very scared, i have a lot of questions but most of all i am terrified.
1819,i dont think i have dry socket but my pain is getting worse, its now the 3rd day after and the vicodin is no longer helping as the pain has worsened. my whole mouth hurts. the bottom wisdom teeth were already out but leaning twards my other teeth causing them to be slightly impacted i suppose but i didnt need an oral surgeon apparently the dentist did the extraction. it took about an hour to do the one that was causing the pain and about 30 min to do the other one. the dentist was wonderful considering my lack of oral care thusfar, i skipped work for a day and went back today, when i got home i was throbbing and it hasnt stopped. should i go back to my dentist or do i need to just tuff it out. i dont want to be paranoid but i cant eat and am crying most of the time
1820,i'm 25yr old female and ive been having low grade fever (37.5-38c) for the last 5 months with no significant symptoms (except for very mild nasal congestion which might be alergic(allergic)). i'm on epilim for epilepsy and i am not taking any other medication. i don't feel sick at all, only a bit tired and chilly which is probably due to the fever itself. any ideas what it can be?when i was a small kid (3 years old) i had a fever for more than a year (38-40c), i didn't have any symptoms back then too. my parents took me to many doctors and i finally ended up in the hospital where they did many tests to find out what was going on (ln biopsy included). they found nothing and concluded that i was healthy and in my case fever didn't necessarily mean sickness. my parents say that my temperature got back to normal by the time i started primary school and it pretty much stayed normal with ocassional break outs- for example i could have been 'perfectly healthy' but i would wake up in the middle of the night feeling feverish. sometimes i checked my temperature and it was 40c but by the time i woke up the next morning fever was gone and i was fine. however, those 'episodes' got pretty rare after high school and now i can't even remember when i had the last one.i know that what medicine 22 years ago considered healthy might not be so today but maybe somebody here has some ideas or similar experiences? :d the low-grade fever that i am experiencing now is not making me feel sick, which is weird because sometimes when i have a cold and the same 38c i feel just awful and have no energy. i can study as usual and do all other things and most of the time i dont even feel that my temperature is higher than it's supposed to be until i check.

1822,i'm 35 and i first noticed the distortion in my left visual field about 7 yrs ago.    it was very slight.    it became very noticeable in the summer of 2007 and has persisted since then.    at that time (summer 2007) i was diagnosed with csr.    my doctor told me there was nothing to be done and we'd just watch it and that it should just go away on its own, but it hasn't. there are many times i don't notice it (or my brain compensates via the normal vision i have in my right eye) but it's always there and i find myself closing my right eye to see if it's still there.    a little depressing.    the doctor said laser isn't an option due to the location being central and the risk of permanent visual loss is greater.    i've read about avastin and lucentis.    i have an identical twin brother that has normal vision.    i'd like to get back to that place.    what can i do? i'm starting to take eye vitamins, which the doctor said really wouldn't do anything, but i'm willing to try almost anything.    i have another appt on dec 12 (2009). since my last appt 3 months ago (when i had 20/30) it seems like my vision in my left eye has gotten a little blurrier.    what can i do to remove the fluid build up under my retina?

1840,i recently took my daughter for an eye exam.    it was found that she needs reading glasses.    this really didn't concern me until i heard that the optometrist was also referring us to an opthalmologist for further testing for something she termed optic nerve head myelination.    could this term please be explained.    i have attempted to research this and have come up empty handed.    please help. thank you.
1841,my girlfriend and i are planning a wedding and moving into a bigger apartment together. i am 30 and she is 20. i know she loves me! i don't know if its the stress of all thats going on, but we don't have sex like we used to. lately we have been arguing more, but i just keep telling myself its just that we are both a little stressed. i don't know what to do??? i have to get on the internet and look at porn to release pressure myself, and she is fine with that. i know she loves me, but i don't know if she is still in love with me. this girl is my everything!!! i just want to feel like i am wanted sexually. we still kiss, cuddle, i mean we do everything together, except have sex......please help me.....
1842,we have done all, tried all we knew and heard to do to get our 3 yr old little boy to mind us and be a normal little boy. i know that this age can be trying i its self, but i am finding myself more regularly hoping someone in the family will take him for a couple days, or i just think to myself at times i just want to run away. i love our little boy with all my heart and i know he has it in him to be good, but ther seems to be no end in sight to his very very mean and cruel behavior. he used to listen somewhat good before our second child was born almost 18months ago. now on a daily basis as soon as he wakes up it is literally not even 5 minutes later and i am already having to tell him repeatedly not to hit his brother, not to throw things, not to scream. i am 6 months pregnant with our third child and i am getting scared to think of what he might try to do to this sibling. i have tried everything from sitting down and talking to him, to time out, taking toys away, sending him to his room, and i have spanked him a couple times for the behavior but now more latley i feel like i am yelling at him all day long, waiting and praying for naptime and bedtime to get here soon because i feel like i am at my wits end with what i can do. he doesnt even attempt to stop what he is doing unless i stand up, then he runs away but doesn't stop. he tells me to shut up when i scold him for hitting the 18 month old or when i tell him not to play with the plug ins and such. i don't knwo what else i can do. i read a post on here saying these actions could be an early sign of a mood disorder. mood disorders run deep and widely spread in my family. i have had therapists tell me i was bipolar and some that say i suffer from severe depression. could i have seriously given such a horrible trait to my child so early in life? are there more specific signs that i need to be watching for? i don't want my 3 yr old to wind up having to be medicated for the same thing i am at such an early age. i am also concerned about the behavior he has already taught my second child becasue he already beats his head on things when he's mad and he throws and hits whatever is closes when he is mad. please help me understand better of all of this. it is so stressful and i just want to enjoy my little guys while they are still so young, but i can't enjoy being stretched to my limits every single day, every hour and almost every minute he is awake. if he does wind up having some sort of mood disorder, how do they treat it in toddlers and how safe is the medicine if needed? just asking because my little brother had adhd really bad when he was young and they gave him ridlin, howver its spelled, i hated the way he was on that medicine. it was like he wasnt fully there and i dont want that for my son.

1844,i am a step mom of a wonderful 5 year old boy, i'll call jd.    the problem is, jd will not stand and pee like a boy.    i think it's mostly because he hasn't really ever been around other boys when they pee.    his dad closes the door behind him when he's in that bathroom, like most people do.    i was hoping that kindergarten would help him a bit since he would be seeing other boys pee, but they have a separate bathroom in their classroom so that idea goes right out of the window.    i was wondering if this is normal and what we can do to fix this.    i am starting to think the only idea now is to take the seat off of the toilet at home so he doesn't have a choice.    we've tried the cheerio in the toilet for target practice to no avail.    help!!

1847,syria 'welcomes' proposal to hand over control of chemical weapons(cnn) -- a new possibility for a diplomatic solution in syria surfaced unexpectedly monday as the war-torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons.but a key question loomed: is that a viable option or simply a stall tactic as president bashar al-assad's government tries to stave off u.s. military action?syrian foreign minister walid moallem told reporters in moscow that his nation welcomes a proposal by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov during talks on monday: put syria's chemical weapons under international control to avert a u.s. military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month.i declare that the syrian arab republic welcomes russia's initiative, on the basis that the syrian leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country, moallem said. we are also confident in the wisdom of the russian government, which is trying to prevent an american aggression against our people.the comments came after secretary of state john kerry discussed a similar scenario, though the state department stressed later monday that syrian president bashar al-assad could not be trusted to relinquish his country's chemical stockpiles.white house spokesman jay carney said the credible threat of a u.s. military attack on syria led to the russian proposal, but he said any such plan would require close evaluation and that washington remained highly skeptical of the syrian regime.taking a 'hard look'still, the united states said it would take a hard look at the plan although state department deputy spokeswoman marie harf said we can't have this be another stalling tactic.everything that assad has done over the past two years and before has been to refuse to put his chem weapons under international control. he hasn't declared them. we've repeatedly called on him to do so. and he's ignored prohibitions against them, she said.so i think it's important to keep in mind the context under which this russian statement and this syrian statement is happening, that this is only happening in the context of a threat of u.s. military action, harf added.latest developmentsearlier monday, kerry said that al-assad could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.speaking at a news conference with british foreign secretary william hague, kerry described that as an impossible scenario.he isn't about to do it and it can't be done obviously, kerry said.the state department later sought to clarify kerry's comment as a rhetorical argument and one u.s. official called it a major goof, adding that america's top diplomat clearly went off script.there is no one in the administration who is taking this syria proposal seriously, the official said.after he flew back from london, kerry spoke with lavrov, a senior administration official said. but it wasn't clear whether the two officials had spoken before or after the russian foreign minister's meeting with his syrian counterpart.several state department representatives sought to clarify kerry's remarks later in the day.his point was that this brutal dictator (al-assad) with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons, otherwise he would have done so long ago, state department spokeswoman jen psaki said. that's why the world faces this moment.hillary clinton weighs inharf said taking a look at the russian proposal doesn't mean the white house is backing down from its push to get authorization from congress to strike syria.in fact, the opopsite. .... we think this is why it's even more important that congress votes to authorize the president to use military action against syrian regime targets, because we can be clear that if we don't give authorization to do so and we don't respond, then assad will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons.could 'goof' be solution?but could kerry's possible gaffe be the key to a diplomatic solution?commentator andrew sullivan says he hopes so.we have the possibility of two things: that russia might actually act decisively to rein assad in, and also support the only viable policy to accomplish what obama wants -- protecting the world from these vile weapons, sullivan wrote monday. i have no idea whether this is a serious move by lavrov -- but it sure seems so, and it presents a fascinating non-binary option. it would manage to bring russia in to solving this problem, without its having to acquiesce to what putin regards as american grand-standing. and it would surely have some traction at the un. sometimes, it seems, kerry's incompetence strikes gold. here's hoping.the obama administration says the al-assad government was responsible for an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside damascus that it said killed more than 1,400 people.obama is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response but is so far meeting resistance from lawmakers and the public concerned about the united states again intervening militarily in a foreign crisis.syria has been engulfed in a civil war that has killed more than 100,000 people over the past two years, according to u.n. estimates.kerry is due to participate in a classified briefing about syria to members of the house of representatives after his return from london later monday.u.n. chief: chemical weapons in syria would be

1849,my 6yr old son is a wonderful, intelligent and imaginative little boy.    however, if something doesn't go his way or the way he believes is fair..he loses control.    he yells, cries, kicks, and occasionally throws things.    you can try to talk to him calmly to explain the situation but it seems like he doesn't hear you and will repeat how he sees it over and over again.     many times he acts this way when he doesn't get what he wants or he loses at something and i understand that this may be resolved by not giving in to the behavior.    my concern is when he acts this way because he has been waiting for his turn and then someone took it, or he has been treated unfairly by friends or someone has been mean to him or laughed at him.    how do i teach him to be able to deal with these situations without losing control of his emotions?
1850,i have a almost 4 year old girl that has started to be extremely defiant. she has always been a strong willed child, but it has become worse in the past 2 weeks. she will not listen or be patient. she will just scream, yell and cry. we have tried to do a reward method and it does not seem to work. we also tell her that we will take something away that is important to her to and that does not even work. it does not matter what time of day it is. it starts first thing in the morning and goes until bedtime. we put her to bed between 7-8 the latest and she wakes normally around 6am. most of the time she takes naps but not as often now. she does not eat sugar or anything like that. oh we have tried timeouts back when she was 2yrs old and that never worked. we do spank her (which i hate and never wanted to do) that does not even seem to work until i do it 6 or more times and it wears her out. i don't know what to do anymore. please help.
1851,my 9yr old has started to hear a mans voice telling her bad things.    her father has custody of her and her step mother is over disciplining her, by way of spanking with a wooden spoon etc...    this voice is scary to her and they think she is wanting attention and making this up.    the voice tells her not to come to my house and not to be around me.    also, when she is asked to do chores - it tells her to say no or i don't have to.    she is otherwise a very normal child.    she is very happy and stable at my house and when i talk to her on the phone she seems fine.    could she be making this up??? i believe her..

1855,my bf has an unusual condition - automatic penis erection. regardless of non-sexual actions such as reading or mowing, he keeps getting erections frequently, almost every hour. it'd last anywhere from few minutes to 20 minutes before it becomes flaccid. i wonder if he has the condition similar to some women who gets non-voluntary orgasms via clitoris stimulation triggered at the slight like a simple movement or shoulder tapping to get attention - nothing sexual or direct contact to the clitoris? he said it's been like that all his life.    by the way, he's turning 50 soon and his penis stiffness hasn't changed one bit since his youth and no problems with it as well (ie, sexual intercourse, urinary, etc.)does this condition have a name and would it create any problems down the road for him (and us).thank you

1858,hello ladies,i am considered very high risk for ovarian cancer (family history), so my doctors have recommended a hysterectomy. they actually didn't have to recommend it, i was going to ask for it, if i had to!    i am 42 years old with no real signs of menopause.    my oncologist said i could wait a bit for the surgery if i wanted to get a bit closer to menopause to try to shorten the possible time on hormone supplements (if needed).    that discussion was about 8 months ago.    i am leaning towards getting the surgery this summer.    i am concerned about going into menopause, possible weight gain, emotional changes, and risks with hormone supplements......    however, i'm more concerned about cancer!    i do not smoke, i am not over weight (i could stand to lose a little weight ;-)))) and am in good health.    i would appreciate any advise or recommendations you have about hormone therapy concerns and any info you can share to prepare me for the hysterectomy.    i have no idea how long recovery would be.    thanks much!
1859,i had a tooth capped more than a year ago and then last week (4) days ago i had a root canal on the same tooth. they of course drilled into the crown and did a full root canal. i have had so much pain since the numbness wore off from the spetacain (sp?) and did some research on it on-line.    the other problem is that i have a severe allergy to latex.    my research found that there are products they use in the root canal that have latex in them and the allergy manifest itself in severe pain.    does anyone have this problem too? and what is the remedy?
1860,hello folks. i'm 22 years old. i'm also a career firefighter. up until a few years ago, i slowly discovered i get nauseous while doing physical work, mainly exercising. i have been on several fires since the start of my career and have threw up on 2 of them....(not good) both about 40 minutes into the call, just shortly after coming out of the building. i was doing extremely strenuous work in both of these fires, including breaching holes in walls to search for a victim, on top of fighting the actual fire.... i have been working out about every day since this issue. i found out when i exercise very hard that i feel a tightness in my throat (not my stomach) that makes me want to vomit. i realize part of it is my breathing, but i fixed that and still have the problem. i can control my adrenalin and i also don't think that is an issue. i am very fit, i weigh 150 lbs, and could run circles around most of my friends if the nausea didn't hold me back. fortunately the nausea didn't kick in until i was walking out the door of the building, but it hit me so fast and before you know it i'm throwing up. to me, this is unacceptable for my occupation. i'm willing to do anything, even if it means surgery to get this fixed. i've noticed when i work out that its mainly when i do sit-ups or am at some kind of angle...which unfortunately we as firefighters crawl on our hands and knees...my doctor doesn't seem to know whats up...so i am going to keep exercising more and more and hope this goes away but it's not looking good even though i'm getting more fit. can anyone please give me some advice?
1861,soar beyond your fears !!!once there was a king who received a gift of two magnificent falcons from arabia. they were peregrine falcons, the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. he gave the precious birds to his head falconer to be trained.months passed and one day the head falconer informed the king that though one of the falcons was flying majestically, soaring high in the sky, the other bird had not moved from its branch since the day it had arrived.the king summoned healers and sorcerers from all the land to tend to the falcon, but no one could make the bird fly. he presented the task to the member of his court, but the next day, the king saw through the palace window that the bird had still not moved from its perch. having tried everything else, the king thought to himself, may be i need someone more familiar with the countryside to understand the nature of this problem. so he cried out to his court, go and get a farmer.in the morning, the king was thrilled to see the falcon soaring high above the palace gardens. he said to his court, bring me the doer of this miracle.the court quickly located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. the king asked him, how did you make the falcon fly?with his head bowed, the farmer said to the king,  it was very easy, your highness. i simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting.we are all made to fly -- to realize our incredible potential as human beings. but instead of doing that, we sit on our branches, clinging to the things that are familiar to us. the possibilities are endless, but for most of us, they remain undiscovered. we conform to the familiar, the comfortable, the mundane. so for the most part, our lives are mediocre instead of exciting, thrilling and fulfilling.so let us learn to destroy the branch of fear we cling to and free ourselves to the glory of flight.

1874,http://carloz.newsvine.com/_news/2010/12/09/5619834-leaked-e-mail-fox-news-caught-slanting-news-reporting-at the height of the health care reform debate last fall, bill sammon, fox news' controversial washington managing editor, sent a memo directing his network's journalists not to use the phrase public option.instead, sammon wrote, fox's reporters should use government option and similar phrases -- wording that a top republican pollster had recommended in order to turn public opinion against the democrats' reform efforts.journalists on the network's flagship news program, special report with bret baier, appear to have followed sammon's directive in reporting on health care reform that evening.sources familiar with the situation in fox's washington bureau have told media matters that sammon uses his position as managing editor to slant fox's supposedly neutral news coverage to the right. sammon's government option email is the clearest evidence yet that sammon is aggressively pushing fox's reporting to the right -- in this case by issuing written orders to his staff.as far back as march 2009, fox personalities had sporadically referred to the government option.two months prior to sammon's 2009 memo, republican pollster frank luntz appeared on sean hannity's august 18 fox news program. luntz scolded hannity for referring to the public option and encouraged hannity to use government option instead.luntz argued that if you call it a 'public option,' the american people are split, but that if you call it the 'government option,' the public is overwhelmingly against it. luntz explained that the program would be sponsored by the government and falsely claimed that it would also be paid for by the government.you know what, hannity replied, it's a great point, and from now on, i'm going to call it the government option.[...]sammon instructed staff to refer on air to government-run health insurance, the government option, the public option, which is the government-run plan, or -- when necessary -- the so-called public option:from: sammon, billsent: tuesday, october 27, 2009 8:23 amto: 054 -fnsunday; 169 -special report; 069 -politics; 030 -root (foxnews.com); 036 -fox.whu; 050 -senior producers; 051 -producerssubject: friendly reminder: let's not slip back into calling it the public option1) please use the term government-run health insurance or, when brevity is a concern, government option, whenever possible.2) when it is necessary to use the term public option (which is, after all, firmly ensconced in the nation's lexicon), use the qualifier so-called, as in the so-called public option.3) here's another way to phrase it: the public option, which is the government-run plan.4) when newsmakers and sources use the term public option in our stories, there's not a lot we can do about it, since quotes are of course sacrosanct.
1875,i am having lens exchange surgery next week to remove hideous rezoom lens and the surgeon originally said i would get a toric as i have in my other eye now. today after more testing, i was told i would be getting a clear lens, not the toric. he wasn  t around to ask but what is a   clear lens   exactly? just a lens with no strength? not sure i understand that and have seen nothing like that on this forum. they say i will see distance well but need reading glasses. i  m ok with that but any info on a   clear lens   and why it would be prescribed would help. my surgeon is out of boston and i trust him totally.

1878,to the doctor:    upon having the floating clouds in my vision for 1 week, i was diagnosed with vitreous detachment 2 days ago. the dr. said he usually sees the patient again after 3 weeks, but since i am scheduled for a caribbean cruise in 9 days, he scheduled me for a return visit in 1 week.    after thinking more clearly now, i am concerned about taking this cruise, in the event that something further happens to my eye while in the caribbean (for only a few days).    he didn't tell me what stage the process is in or long this detachment process takes.    to obtain further clarification, i placed a call to him on fri. afternoon, but he never returned my call--today is sat. 11 a.m.    any suggestions on how to proceed? a friend is included in this trip, and i want to make a decision asap since the trip impacts others.
1879,wow! where do i begin? i'm 20+ and i've had my iud in for nearly 2.5 months. before the iud was inserted i heard nothing but great things about the mirena from all of my doctors. then, 8 weeks after i had my baby and the iud was inserted, i have heard nothing but gruesome horror stories about this device from others. but let me express to you my experience thus far.irregular periods & crampingsince insertion of the iud, i have only experienced light spotting. however, i have been experiencing some severe cramping off and on (approx. 1-2 times a day). literally, it feels as though someone is shoving a knife in my stomach. last week, i went in for a checkup to see if the device had been improperly placed. the ultrasound tech performed a trans-vaginal & regular ultrasound on me. according to my dr., the iud was properly placed & the results looked phenomenal. but why didn't i feel phenomenal? as explained by my dr., severe cramping is a normal symptom and will probably occur for the next couple of months. i have yet to discover if this cramping will really and truly go away.weight:after birth, i weighed 232. before i had the mirena inserted 8 weeks later, i weighed 207. since i've had the mirena, i've lost 4 lbs and am still losing. also, i do not diet or exercise. however, i do believe the fact that i breastfeed may play a major role in my weight loss.sex drive:ha! not to be too detailed but i don't think i can get enough of my husband. lol!!!! before i got the iud, our sex life was great. afterwards, it was even greater. i will leave it at that!depression:i'm pretty sure someone would become depressed after finding out that they have something inserted in them that could possibly cause them more harm than good. i've found myself wrecking my brain over whether i should keep this thing in or take it out. i've start thinking crazy thoughts like, what if i die and my baby is left motherless or what if i can never conceive again? does that not sound depressing? well, other than what i've mentioned i do not think i am so depressed that i need antidepressants. i'm just trying to understand if this thing is for me or against me. that's all.hair loss:well, my hair always falls out when i comb it. but not so much to where it is noticeable. since this has been going on since before i got the mirena, i do not think it has anything to do with it,overall:my experience with the mirena has not been so bad as others. the only downfall for me is the severe cramping. i will update in a few months if things begin to go downhill for me.

1882,i have an itchy pimple like rash that is spreading all over my body. to my knowledge this is the third time i have had it but this time seems to be the worst. the area starts to really itch then turns into little pimples. nothing otc seems to help. the only relief i have is if i dot nailpolish over it. seems to help. the rash is in the arm pit, chest, back, under the breast, sides of torso and is working it's way down. some have already appeared in groin area and legs. i may have one on my head! please help me find some sort of relief and a way to get rid of this! years ago when i had a similar breakout i went to a dermatologist. he didn't know what it was either but said it may be viral. suggested that i had a cut on the body which got an infection in it whicj=h may have caused the breakout. he gave me some scripts and topical lotions. those helped very little and the rash eventually went away but it took months. please help!
1883,i am a 26-year-old girl. i have been masturbating via clitoris since i was 4! i have lost my sense of pleasure gradually. i lost its strong and uncontrollable feeling when i was 12 and after that time its feeling has become less and less and of course shorter and shoter. and also my sexual    arousal is becoming less and less. my clit have become numb so my sexual    arousal is becoming less. it just takes 2 second with a lot of attempt to reach orgasm and its feeling is not satisfactoy!i can't have orgasm with a boy and i don  t enjoy my sex and oral stimulation! i know there is something wrong with me and this makes me depressed. i just had one boyfriend when i was 23 and i cried after any contact we had.i am virgin because in my culture having sex with a man before marriage is vice! and i am afraid if it is a serious problem and also penis-vagina stimulation won't give me the pleasure and orgasm. have i hurt myself? is it a defect? have i damaged my nerve?    is it possible to have the clit feeling back?please help me, i am afraid of having sex with a boy.

1885,my son was at the age of 9 years diagnosed with undesending testis . this was never found at birth and now i am curious if this causes all the behavior problems and agression he has had over the years .i am full of questions for the uroligist when i have to take him    on jan 24 2008.i knew when he was a toddler something was not right with him having all the agression he was exhibiting as a toddler trying to sufforcate and hurt his sister . he was later diagnosed with short term memory problems in school and on a iep plan at school.he was diagnosed with adhd , ocd and optional defiant behavior as well .     i just dont understand why this was not caught at birth(undesending testicles) and even more so with regular well check ups why the pedatrician never found this problem.    with his testis not being in his scrotum where they belong ..i took my son to a well check up with a pediatrican in sebastian florida and she checked him out and found he has undecending testicles .. a major    shock for me and his father both ..ultrasound showed that on the left side less blood flow the cord getting tangled and on the right not as bad.when my son lived with his dad his step- mom took him to the doctor and my son was complaining of pain and he was tested for urnairy infection but when this came back negitive and our son continued to complain of pain the doctor never bothered to examine him futher downstairs to see if the pain was coming another medical problem rather than a urinary infectioni was curious if this can cause problems with the male hormones and be the root of all his agression or    he also has symtoms(symptoms)of prader willi .    he will drink soda to the point of making himself sick . he has had an obssesion with the refrigirator since he was a toddler ... his bmi is at the 95% and i could be wrong but he does have many of the symtoms(symptoms)... not sure if he would have this with the xxy problem ?    i m not a doctor but i thought if his testicles were not were they should be he would have low hormones not high .. but could either cause all the behavior problems ..thanks

1894,hi everyone,i have been suffering from shingles for about 8 months. they keep breaking out.they just barely broke out to the right side of my spine. i have them on both sides of my body. they are very painfull. i have been very ill and not able to go out and feel well. occasionally i go out for bits of time, but it is difficult because of the pain.this has been a long going process. before shingles broke out the doctor could not figure out what i had only that my white blood cell count was high. we had done many blood tests and i had given up. then a little rash appeared... then came on the low grade fever,headaches,and panic attacks from the pain. it was so dreadfull.anywho it's been a while and i need some advice on who i should consult and how. my parents can not afford the doc right now. we do know a friend who is a doctor and many times weve tried to get ahold of him and we will keep trying to show him some photos and stuff.i am very unwell and really need some help. shingles also make me very moody and depressed, i just want to know if that is normal. theyve made me act pretty odd at times, things i wouldnt do just because of shingles depression.so anyone who can help please do and i will respond logically. please do not suggest anything illogical like flying out of state or paying to see a doc. we do not have those oppurtunites. thanks! i'd love advice. has anyone else had shingles so long?

1898,hello- i am 36 yrs old.    i had iols put in in 97.    i have always had small halos ever since.    seems in the past 5 years the halo effect is geting worse in both eyes but more in the right.    when my right eye tries to focus on the sun, or a certain light, it has a disco-ball type effect around the light until my eye focuses as best it can.    if i look the other direction into the same light, the disco effect is still present, only it is counter-clockwise in the same direction of the eye. kind of streaky.        similar to what floaters do when you attempt to catch them in your visual field.    the amber street lights at night are horrible in the right eye.    the symptoms best described are as if i am looking through a defective peice of plastic.    reminds me of what plastic headlights on cars do after several years.    they break down or something.    has anyone out there ever heard of something like what i describe about    my iol?    i have been to many doctors and eyes check out fine, iols look clear.    is it possible that what i am seeing, the doctors may not be able to see with their equipment?    i'm trying my hardest to make it, and this is a big problem every day while working.    please let me know if anyone has heard of a similar situation.    thanks.....
1899,http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39625809/ns/world_news-americas/#10/12/10copiapo, chile    fresh air and freedom were just hours away on tuesday for 33 miners trapped a half-mile underground for 69 days, men whose endurance and unity have captivated the world. no one in the history of mining has been trapped so long and survived.this story started as a tragedy and we hope that in a few hours, it'll end in a miracle, chilean president sebastian pinera said to reporters gathered at the mine site.video: watch live video of rescue operation (on this page)pinera said hopes were the rescue would begin at about 5 p.m. eastern time.i hope that family members, before the day is over, start to hug their fathers, brothers, sons, he said.follow breakingnews.com for the latest updatespinera told the mother of 31-year-old florencio avalos that he'll be the first of 33 men to be rescued from the collapsed mine.his mother, maria silva, says he's not surprised he was chosen and that she's very proud of him. avalos is a married father of two children and one of the mining crew bosses..we made a promise to never surrender, and we kept it, pinera said, shortly before two rescue workers were expected to go down to prepare the miners for their trip. the president said the first miner will be brought up about two hours later.chile has taken extensive precautions to ensure the miners' health and privacy, sending down navy special forces paramedics to prepare them for the trip and using a screen to block the top of the shaft from more than 1,000 journalists at the scene.nervous anticipation grew among the miners' relatives and friends as mining minister laurence golborne earlier said rescuers aimed to start hoisting the miners in a custom-made escape capsule on tuesday evening, hours ahead of schedule.panic attacks feared during miner rescue..the men have spent 69 days in the hot, humid bowels of a gold and copper mine in chile's northern atacama desert after an aug. 5 collapse, and now face a harrowingly claustrophobic journey to the surface in specially-made capsules.asked about the biggest technical problem that could hit the rescue operation, coordinator andre sougarett said: a rock could fall.there is no need to try to start guessing what could go wrong. we have done that job, a confident golborne said. we have hundreds of different contingencies.rescuers were keeping the miners busy on final preparations they were to climb into the capsule for what tests indicated should be a smooth ride to the outside world.the rescue of all the miners is expected to take about 48 hours, nbc news reported, with crews working around the clock. it will take approximately one hour for each miner to reach the surface    a few minutes to situate a miner in the capsule, 10-15 minutes travel time upward, and then 25-30 minutes to drop the escape cage down the shaft again.as the miners emerge, they will be sheltered from the glare of tv cameras. they will get an immediate medical check and gather with a few family members in an area closed to the news media. officials say a siren will sound as each miner emerges.then, they will ride in helicopters    two at a time if they are in beds, or four at a time if they can sit up    to the regional hospital in copiapo for a battery of physical and psychological exams.our job is to provide benefit and not harm, manalich said, urging the media    more than 1,000 journalists are working on the story    to respect their privacy. we have to protect them until the last minute, until they can return to normal lives with their families.wives, children, parents and friends are waiting on an arid, rocky hillside around 2,050 feet directly above them at a tent settlement dubbed camp hope and ready to celebrate..right now i'm calm, though still very anxious. i hope my nerves don't betray me when the rescue starts, said jessica salgado, whose husband alex is trapped below.president piniera, who ordered a revamp of mine safety regulations in the wake of the accident, arrived at the mine on tuesday afternoon in anticipation of the rescue. one of the miners is a bolivian national and bolivian president evo morales has also vowed to visit the mine for his rescue.'camp hope'while the men endured their darkened days below, life at camp hope has turned into a spawning ground of intrigue, envy and rivalries that have divided the miners' relatives holding vigil here    just as their shared plight unites them.after 69 days of shared fears and jitters    all of it under the close scrutiny of dozens of reporters that have now grown to a battalion    the early fellowship has frayed. some relationships, once at least cordial, are as hostile as the desolate sands of the surrounding acatama desert.here the tension is higher than down below. down there they are calm, said veronica ticona, sister of 29-year-old ariel ticona, a trapped rubble-removal machine operator...relatives privately shared stories of the divisiveness with an associated press reporter who spent the past month at the camp, frequently bedding down in a tent beside theirs, sharing coffee and gossip.the feuds and jealousies within families centered on such matters as who got to take part in weekend videoconferences with the miners, who received letters and why    or even who should speak to the media and how much they should be revealing about a family's interior life.

1901,could you tell me if there is a push for he new 'universal flu vaccine ' that will prevent all flu strains with a single shot and is it true that in the process the medical community has admitted that the current flu shot is mediaclly useless as it fails to target the correct flu strain ?
1902,i had ten crowns done at the same time four days ago.    scott tried to answer my question, but he assumed that i still have temporary crowns.    the severe pressure has diminished somewhat but i now feel pain in two of the teeth; it seems that the nerves have been compromised by the pressure and now with relief of the pressure i feel pain through the teeth.    i also believe that the two crowns may not be sealed because a slight odor seems to be emitting from those two teeth.    i'm going to the dentist on 4-14-09 at 9am.    please advise on how to handle this with the dentist.    read my previous post    for the entire story.thanks,micki
1903,i am 6'-1 and weigh 172 pounds and i am a highly competitive runner and nordic skier.    for the past two years, when i run, or train at a high level of intensity (ie. intervals or racing) the blood pressure in my right leg drops dramatically, thus causing a tremendous pain/burn in my quadracept (upper and lower), and calf - it feels like a 40 pound weight has been attached to my leg, ultimately forcing me to stop.    when i do stop, it takes a minute for my leg to return to normal.    the doctors i've consulted call this sensation claudication, but have yet to find out what is causing the disorder.    i have gone to message therapy, worked on various stretches, and gone through several batteries of tests (treadmill/stress, angiogram, mra/mri, sonogram), yet to no avail.    speculation ranges from chronic compartment syndrome of the upper leg, which i have found very little information, to overdeveloped adductor or quadricept muscles, to even the possibility that my femoral or illiac arteries are being banded by my muscles across the ingunial ligament - no one knows!    i have reached the point of maximum frustration and i do not know what to do do next - can you help me?    have you ever heard of this problem?    how do i fix it without stopping?
1904,ive had alot of eye problems ever since i first started wearing contacts.. ive had ulcers, tons of pink eye, and even a cut or two on my eyes. but my doctor always took care of them well before he retired, and when it happened it was always few and far between. a while back after my eye doctor retired my right eye lids had started swelling. i thought oh no biggie its spring i get allergies and sinus probs etc... but it never stopped swelling.. after about a 4 weeks my eye was swollen so big and it had become so red it look like i had been punched in the eye socket without getting bruised. so typically i go to the emergency room thinking this is way different than the normal pink eye or ulcers.. and it wasnt even painful which was my other concern.after like a nice 5 hour wait im told i have pink eye. they didnt swab my eye, do tests or anything.. they only made me read a board across the room without my glasses on. well i was very unsure of the answer they gave me but went home took the meds they gave me and nothing worked. after about 4 months the swelling stopped. my eye went back to normal, and i was able to wear contacts again. so i get a new doctor, new perscription.. turns out that eye sees even better than my last checkup 2 years ago.well now it has started swelling again.. and im pretty sure its not because i dont ake care of my eyes.. because after a painful ulcer like the ones ive had i am extra extra careful with my contacts. so now on top of swelling its producing a ton of protien buildup in my eyelids and on my eyelashes especially when i wake up.. i cant even open my eye some days because its sealed shut. what am i going to do? i know this cant be pink eye.. theres no way it could last this long and not at least effect the other eye or be somewhat painful. i need some advice.. anyone have any earthly ideas what it could possibly be?
1905,believe in yourselfthere may be days when you get up in the morningand things aren't the way you had hoped they would be,that's when you have to tell yourselfthat things will get better.there are times when people disappoint you and let you down,but those are the times when you must remind yourselfto trust your own judgments and opinions, to keep yourlife focused on believing in yourselfand all that you are capable of.there will be challenges to face andchanges to make in your life,and it is up to you to accept them.constantly keep yourself headed in the right direction for you.it may not be easy at times,but in those times of struggleyou will find a stronger sense of who you are,so when the days come that are filled withfrustration and unexpected responsibilities,remember to believe in yourself and all you want your life to be,because the challenges and changes will only help you tofind the goals that you know are meant to come true for you.keep believing in yourself.

1907,by: j. christian adamsoped contributoraugust 9, 2010two unpleasant topics of conversation most of us avoid are the epidemic of hiv/aids among prison inmates and a variety of sometimes violent events resulting in transmission of the disease. some states long ago implemented policies to protect the uninfected part of the prison population while providing exceptional medical treatment and counseling to the infected population.in south carolina, it has worked so well since 1998 that there has only been a single transmission of hiv/aids to a noninfected prisoner. all that may change, however, thanks to a threat from eric holder's justice department.south carolina received a letter from the now-infamous civil rights division that the policy of keeping infected inmates at a designated facility, instead of scattered across the state in the general prison population, may unfairly stigmatize infected prisoners. to the obama political appointees in the civil rights division, this constitutes discrimination under the americans with disabilities act.the justice department objects to separate living facilities and specialized medical treatment for the hiv/aids prison population. naturally, doj has threatened a lawsuit.apparently the justice department doesn't have the will or resources to follow through in cases against new black panther party thugs brandishing weapons at polling places, but has no difficulty shaking down a state with an effective and humane policy toward prisoners.these folks are shameless, says john ozmint, the no-nonsense director of the south carolina prison system, referring to the civil rights division at doj. he told me that every single new prisoner is tested for aids upon incarceration.ozmint says half of those testing positive never knew they were infected. the testing policy saves lives because treatment starts immediately, at state expense.those testing positive receive treatment at the broad river road correctional facility near columbia. they also receive extensive counseling there. but they are not part of the general prison population.south carolina doesn't have to do this. for starters, the state doesn't have to test prisoners. it could simply toss infected inmates unwittingly into the general prison population.these inmates would be scattered across 28 facilities, all without the specialized care available at the broad river facility. all of the extra counseling and treatment is also optional, but provided by the state at significant expense.south carolina spends more than $2 million a year helping infected inmates in the very program the doj is challenging. we couldn't ever hire specialists at all of the facilities spread across the state like we can in the single columbia facility, ozmint told me.the doj is in a lose-lose situation. even if doj wins a lawsuit, sources tell me south carolina is simply going to cancel all of the special testing, treatment and counseling, thereby saving the state $2 million a year.instead, the state will dump infected prisoners into the general population, and nobody will know they have aids. worse, prisoners who come to prison with hiv/aids will never know they have the disease and their lives will be shortened because the testing program will end.special counseling would end, too. of course, if doj loses a lawsuit, which seems likely, they lose.our policy promotes health and safety. testing all inmates and treating hiv/aids is expensive and many states do not test, ozmint says. they have identified which inmates can impose a death sentence by biting, stabbing or merely inflicting a flesh wound with a contaminated weapon and we have eliminated the spread of hiv/aids to other inmates or to staff.justice raises three primary objections to this effective and humane approach. first, it prevents infected prisoners from participating in activities and jobs of their choosing. leave it to bureaucrats in washington to concoct the grievance that prisoners have choices when it comes to activities in the first place.second, doj claims the south carolina program is unconstitutional, something the courts have repeatedly rejected. once again we see the rule of law falling by the wayside when it comes to decisions of this civil rights division. this is the same civil rights division that was sanctioned more than $4 million during the clinton administration for bringing cases as frivolous as the one against south carolina prisons.third, with all the pragmatism of a sociology lecture at harvard, doj argues that the separation of the hiv/aids prisoners stigmatizes the prisoners. ozmint responds, prison is a voluntary activity; breaking the law, earning a criminal record, and wearing 'state issue,' all stigmatize. since one purpose of prison is punishment, this stigmatization is somewhat intentional. how refreshing.ozmint's comments reveal the accelerating divide between highly paid bureaucrats in washington and people in the rest of the country. having worked in the civil rights division, i cannot emphasize strongly enough how perfectly correct and completely justified doj bureaucrats consider policies like the threat to south carolina to be. and having lived and worked in the private sector and in parts of america far from the beltway, i also cannot overstate just how insane such policies sound to most americans.it isn't just the south carolina prisons in the crosshairs of the civil rights division. it is mortgage lenders and insurance companies. it is movie theaters and flat-broke counties that don't print ballots in foreign languages.it's also amazon.com, which tried to sell a talking kindle reader, but justice said it couldn't because the button to make the kindle talk didn't have braille. never mind that books neither talk nor have braille buttons telling them to talk.the business community would be wise to wake up and recognize the immense power the civil rights division exerts over the private sector. groups like the u.s. chamber of commerce should devote resources to understanding and moderating the extremist tendencies of the current civil rights division. even returning to clinton-era policies would be an improvement.keep in mind that the clinton justice department refused to attack the south carolina prison plan even though it was pressed to do so. there is now a different species of democrat in power in washington.even south carolina democrats have disclaimed their party brethren in washington over the doj threat. this is the last thing incumbent democrat john spratt needs in his contest against mick mulvaney in the rural 5th congressional district -- more proof the administration in washington has gone bonkers.this is about whether you want more aids or less aids in the prisons, ozmint said. all indications are that the south carolina department of corrections isn't going to surrender an inch to the doj.officials promise to do whatever it takes to defeat a lawsuit. no case brought by the civil rights division is bulletproof. many defendants incorrectly think they can never defeat the department in litigation, so they capitulate and settle.as south carolina may soon demonstrate to the rest of the nation, it pays to fight back.j. christian adams served as an attorney in the civil rights division and covers election law at electionlawcenter.com.find this article at:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/justice-department-fights-south-carolina-over-efforts-against-aids-in-prisons-1008381-100224289.html#ixzz0w7ylzgpf
1908,my retina specialist has consistently said i have mild dry armd.    in june, 07, my visual field in the armd and glaucoma eye was near normal.    two weeks ago, i had another visual field taken and was told the eye has worsened significantly.    the glaucoma specialist says it's probably the retina, based on her interpretation of the visual field data.i am seeing much worse in that eye, with a graying of the central vision.    i also have severe floaters which have been increasing over the last six months.    each time checked, i've been told no tears.    floaters may have fooled me that there was no change in the central vision due to retina changes.are such 'rapid' changes in visual field unusual?is it possible for any other factor to be the main contributor to my dramatic vision change/loss in the left eye, other than worsening macula conditions?
1909,my 5 year old son was playing with the hamper that is full of dirt(dried leaves,etc). suddenly he got up and holding his right eye. after few minutes, he said he was fine. but then after few hours i noticed a blackish,brownich,reddish little spot on the white of his eye under the lower eyelid. he said there is no pain, and it does not bother him. is it possible that the spot is an embedded dirt or could it be a hemorrhage? he was also coughing too much on that day it happenned.thank you for any response to my problem
1910,my dad died on april 21, 2010...very recently.    at first i couldn't stop crying, begging god to let me have him back.    (crazy, i know.)    now i don't cry so much, but have an incredibly hard time just getting out of bed in the morning.    my doctor has given me some medication for anxiety, and if i don't take it, i get a panic attack.    what is wrong with me?    i miss my dad a lot, especially for advice, etc., but he was 84 and suffering.    i didn't want him to suffer anymore, but when he died, i could hardly believe it.    help!    i feel like i am most certainly going crazy.

1916,washington (cnn) - after months of intense negotiations, a bipartisan u.s. house group has reached an agreement in principle on immigration reform, according to rep. mario diaz-balart of florida, one of the gop members of the group.a democratic aide familiar with the discussions confirmed that all the members signed on and told cnn both democrats and republicans will now run the whole package past their respective leadership and colleagues and aim to formally introduce legislation at the beginning of june.diaz-balart declined to get into the details of the deal, but said, there's going to be a lot of differences in a lot of areas, from a bipartisan measure working its way through the senate.filing a real bipartisan bill    a serious, enforceable commonsense bill is, i think, a huge step. but it's the first step of the process    a very important step, diaz-balart told reporters outside the house floor thursday.the four republican members of the house group include diaz-balart, rep. raul labrador of idaho, and rep. john carter and rep. sam johnson, both of texas.the four democrats are reps. xavier becerra and zoe lofgren, both of california, rep. luis gutierrez of illinois, and rep. john yarmuth of kentucky.carter told reporters earlier on thursday that the last sticking point involved whether the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states would get access to government health care benefits. it's unclear how the group resolved that issue.carter also said that because republican and democratic negotiators were unable to come to an agreement on a program overseeing guest workers, the group decided to leave that issue out of the bill. but both planned to offer their proposals separately, likely as amendments to the main legislation.both sides differed on how many worker visas should be allowed for construction companies and other industries relying on low skilled labor workers.house speaker john boehner pledged that any immigration bill would move through the appropriate committees in the house before any vote by the full chamber.a key test for the bipartisan deal will come when the house judiciary committee takes it up, because that panel includes a significant number of conservatives, who have pledged to block any measure that allows a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.boehner signaled he wanted the house to have its own version to negotiate a final immigration bill with the democratic-led senate.i continue to believe that the house needs to deal with this and the house needs to work its will, boehner said on thursday.the senate plan is now being considered by the judiciary committee.source: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/16/breaking-house-reaches-immigration-agreement/?hpt=hp_t2
1917,http://lifeinc.today.com/_news/2013/04/23/17880268-rich-got-richer-during-the-recovery-and-rest-got-poorer-study-says?litethe nation  s richest american households generally gained wealth during the first two years of the economic recovery, a new research report finds, while most american households saw their net worth drop.the report, released tuesday by the pew research center, found that the mean net worth for the 7 percent of american households at the top of the wealth distribution rose by 28 percent between 2009 and 2011, the most recent data available.meanwhile, the mean net worth for the other 93 percent of american households fell by 4 percent during that period, according to pew  s analysis of census data.overall, the aggregate net worth for all american households rose between 2009 and 2011. but pew  s more detailed analysis showed that the gains were concentrated among the wealthiest americans, and the wealth gap increased during that time.economists say that  s a continuation of a trend toward more wealth being found at the top of the income scale.  there  s been a growing concentration of wealth in this country for quite a while now, and it  s just really accelerated in the last, really, 15 years,   said joel naroff, chief economist with naroff economic advisors, who was not involved in the pew study.the great recession officially ran from december of 2007 to june of 2009, but the recovery since that time has been weak and uneven.the pew researchers said rallies in stocks and bonds, which benefited affluent households with major investments, largely drove the discrepancy in wealth gains during those two years.the housing market, where many other americans derive a lot of their wealth, did not do that well during that period.the pew researchers said they focused on the top 7 percent of the wealth distribution because that was the tabulation available from the census data. the report found that the mean net wealth for those 8 million households rose to around $3.17 million in 2011, from approximately $2.48 million in 2009.for the other approximately 111 million households, mean net worth fell to nearly $134,000 in 2011, from nearly $140,000 in 2009.the report  s authors note that some less-wealthy american households no doubt saw wealth gains during the period. in general, however, more of the households in that 93 percent saw their wealth fall rather than rise.naroff noted that income distribution is always shifting in one way or another, but the wealth gap has grown especially wide in recent years. that could pose problems for an economy that is largely driven by consumer spending.  we haven  t seen it at least in 100 years as heavily distributed to the upper income side as we  re seeing now, and we don  t know whether that pattern is readily reversed,   he said.   and if it  s not reversed what happens to the economy that  s built on a consumer base? that  s the uncertainty that we have.  i was going to add this onto ms. p's banking thread but i thought it deserved its own.

1924,hi guys. i'm asking this question on behalf of my dad. he has developed cataracts in both eyes and is looking into the surgery options.the local surgeon has presented him standard monofocal iols and the acrysof restor iol. the surgeon has recommended the monofocal. i have looked around the web and found that there are other options in the multifocal department such as the amo rezoom and the amo technis multifocal. i will look around for the availability of these lenses.my dad does some driving and also uses the computer. from what i have read the rezoom seems like a better choice since it balances out between near and far vision. i could not find information about the technis, though according to the website it provides all round excellent vision for all distances.i have two questions. first, would a multifocal be far superior to the monofocal? i ask because the multifocal lens is quite a bit more expensive. second, i have read that the restor lens has now been improved. if so, what are the advantages/disadvantages between the restor, rezoom and technis? user reports would be really useful.thanks in advance for all the help.

1940,i posted a rather lengthy explanation of my history on april 10th and was answered by dr. michael kutryb who suggested my seeing the best opthamologist in my area.    i have an appointment with an opthamologist later this month, but may cancel in order to try to see another who is probably one of the best in st louis.    this doctor was recommended by a neurologist whom i saw today.    he diagnosed me with vkh, vogt koyanagi harada syndrome or disease, after a very brief consultation.    i am not sure that he even looked at my medical history.    i was somewhat in shock and was confused with this diagnosis, especially since    he came up with it so quickly.    after looking it up online, i am even more confused since i do not have the skin and hair symptoms.    he assured me that he is a very good doctor and knows what he is talking about and was very convincing. either that is true or he is psychic or a miracle worker!    i will take a miracle at this point. my question is related to the fact that he said that it is not a neurological problem.    what i have read seems to indicate that there can be neurological aspects or complications.    i have worried that the chronic inflammation that i have been experiencing for so long may be causing some kind of nerve damage.    i have both visual and mental disorientation. i have not driven a car for almost two years.    the opthamologist that i have been seeing for the past few years has never mentioned uveitis.    do i dare to hope that i may be finally getting some answers?this discussion is related tocould my eyes have been contaminated?.
1941,i just recently moved in with my girlfriend who's daughter is 5 (i have no kids) - the little girl is basically running things around the house and mom gives in to everything the girl wants, eventually. ive talked to my gf about it and we've come to the conclusion that something must be done. every morning there is a fight about brushing teeth, and what clothes she will and wont wear (she tells mom to pick it out, then says no shes not wearing it, pick out something else and so on and so forth), do my hair like yours, no thats not good enough..etc. -    but at night is the biggest problem, mom has allowed, thus far, the little girl to lay on the couch every night and watch tv until she falls asleep, then mom carries her to her room and puts her down, every night the little girl wakes up and crawls in bed with us (she seems too old, to me at least, for this behavior). i sat the little girl down and talked to her, told her we were setting some new rules and have set up a chores and reward program and also given her some big kid responsibility to make her own breakfast and pick out her own clothes. the girl responds to me quite well and does what i ask of her except when mom gets around, but thats another issue altogether. so big new rule was we were going to act like a big girl and sleep in her own bed, no tv - instead reading a book, and if she woke up in the middle of the night, at first, she could come in the room with us (just to ween her off of it slowly) but at least start off in her room. it started off wonderfully, mom read her a story then i laid in there and talked to her until she fell asleep - then 1:30am wake up call... horrible.. she throws a huge fit, blood curtling screams and nonstop crying,    because she wants to watch tv, we say no and stick to it (but of course mom wants us to just turn on the tv to shut her up).. the fit lasts about 30min, then she wants an oreo, then she wants her daddy, then back to the tv, this fit, still screaming and crying and now running from us around the house and trying to turn on the tv set, lasts another 30 min.. then when finally realizing she is not getting her way, a new game begins, now her eyes hurt and she cant sleep and now she needs medicine cause her leg hurts and now she needs a damp rag for her eyes, no not that towel a different towel, now you didnt wet it enough, now shes thirsty, now she doesnt want the towel, now she does want the towel, get a different towel, now she wants to sleep in moms bed. i wanted to put her in her room and let her cry it out, but im apparently heartless, mom gives in to the new game being played now.. no longer the tv fight, its now the power struggle to get her way (at least in my eyes), and the kid just won it again.. please help me before mom loses faith in my ideas for better behavior (it was hard enough to even talk to her about it seeing as its not my kid) and before i go insane.
1942,i am 31, 5'4.    i was always 120lbs or below until recently.    i am at my highest weight yet at 145lbs.    i do not look fat.    i work out on a regular.    i do 3 40 minute cardio sessions a week.    i couple this with 3 running sessions per week on the treadmill.    my running sessions are interval trainings.    the first week i walked briskly for 2 minutes and ran 1 minute 10 times.    the second week i walked one minute and ran 1 minute 15 times.    the third week i walked 1 minute and ran 2 minutes 10 times.    the fourth week i walked 1 minute and ran 4 minutes 7 times.    the fifth week i walked 1 minute and ran 6 minutes 5 times.    i am currently on my sixth week walking 1 minute and running 7 minutes 4 times, while also upping my 3 cardio workouts to 42 minutes.    i include arms 3 times a week, along with crunches and lunge exercises.    my diet monday thru friday is this...a 20 oz coffee, slim fast with a banana and a low fat yogurt, 10-15 carrots, a handful of grapes, a frozen lunch <300calories, a low fat cheese stick, 1 serving of whole wheat crackers or pretzels, an apple, a hanful of mixed nuts and then finally dinner, which is either grilled chicken or fish with a fresh veggie.    what is going on?    i should be 120 lbs, yet i have steadily maintained 145 lbs.    i couldn't eat any healthier and if i worked out any more my knees would be destroyed.    what should i do, or what am i doing wrong?
1943,after foreplay with my husband my vagina swelled up and was in alot of pain, i couldnt continue with my husband and have sex and now my vagina is is very swollen its blue/purple in colour and very sore. what can i do? i am so embarresed but yet in alot of pain.
1944,i have been getting a really bad stomach pain after running. it has been occurring every time i run, which is a few times a week. its in my lower abdomen and it almost feels like a cramp but a lot worse and it last about 30 minutes. should i see a doctor? or is this something i can fix myself?
1945,i have some blood test results here:31 oct: 222 h1 nov: 81 h2 nov: 93 hthey refer to ast levels.    do you know what ast levels actually are?    what does ast stand for?    are these within the healthy range for a 17-year-old girl?    and if not, what would the probable cause and symptoms be?
1946,this is funny, although i feel really sorry for the poor moose.    this morning we had a young moose running around downtown in the city i live in.    keep in mind that i live in the 4th largest city in canada...about 1,000,000 people.    the poor thing wandered in and was right downtown..see the link below.i am happy to report the moose was caught, tranquilized and returned to the wild.    she is healthy and ok, although i am certain she is probably a bit traumatized.http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/ctvnews/20100513/cgy_moose_downtown_100512/20100513/?hub=calgaryhome

1948,ok, whatever your views are of glen beck. are any of you from the city of new york and if so, are you all ok with this behavior? i mean seriously? kids peeing and pooing on the playground? this is why the people in third world countries have so many diseases and such. how can this be allowed in the us? i am not    from ny, but is there a reason why no parents dared to say anything including glen beck?http://www.glennbeck.com/2011/06/03/lack-of-courage-stu-calls-out-glenn/
1949,i have a 3 year old son who throws the worst temper tantrums. up until he turned 3 we always seemed to give into him but now that we are a month off having our third child (we also have a 6 year old girl) he is uncontrollable. he doesn't listen, never does what he is told and his tantrums are leaving my husband and i at our wits end. one minute he can be so good and adorable and then he changes like you have flicked a switch and goes crazy. i am so worried that there may be an underlying condition.
1950,it has been a long time since i have learned that i suffer from severe depression, that one catalytic disaster can spin me wildly off the straight mind set. it happened and still to this day i keep suffering that consequence. i keep feeling like i spin deeper down a pit of a never ending reminder of broken hearts, torn souls and never ending tears. the replay in my mind of everything just never stops and it has slowly been killing me inside. i have wished for death so many times knowing it would stop this pain that i can  t control. you see i never was the person who would drink her sorrows away or drug myself up. i am the person who would conflict pain to rid myself of other pains. sadly, admitting a second form of pain isn  t working anymore and i feel the further i allow this pain to control me the darker my mind set is getting. i don  t want to leave, i feel like i need to accomplish something with my life, anything to prove to myself that it is worth living. how does anyone handle this? there really isn  t anyone i trust enough to talk to about it; unemployment doesn  t give me much to afford therapy or even medication. it  s becoming tiring to put on a happy face for others when i am not happy.
1951,my close up or reading vision has not been very good for some time ( years-) in in the past 2 years    reading glasses and magnifyers had enabled me to do some craft work for short periods of time. i have had a multitude of procedures over the past few years and have become accustomed to and adjusting to low vision.    in any case i have had more retinaplexi for horshoe tears in the retina ( 3 ) this year and the specialist explained that the vitreaous is pulling away and occasionally causes these tears. i think the doc is getting a bit more concerned lately ( although he tells us its ok ) because he has me on a    2 - 3 month exam schedule now ( went from yearly to 9 to 6 and now every 2-3 months )my question is this-- lately my reading vision is worse- not a lot but noticeably worse- my distance vision seems to be the same.     i thinjk the doc told us one time that the macula ( had some bouts with macular swelling and a pucker peel-vitrectomy in the right eye ) effects close up or detail vision but we think he said the vetreous pulling away also effects close up vision in older patients ( i am only 54 but the doc told us one time that my eyes remind him of much older in terms of condtions ) .before my macular pucker and vitrectomy    ( rt eye )    that eye was of no help to read ect. and was makeing me sick from all the wavey    images and the procedure has taken care of that 100% and i can almost read the top line of the reading chart with it now .does the vitreous pulling away effect reading vision??i am constantly getting round dot floaters in my left eye and doc said eventually we may have to do a vitrectomy on the left eye but doesn't want to until absolutely needed- i asked if it was because of possible side effects and he said no he just feeles it would be better to wait---i do have lens issues ( occular rosacea-dry eye-chronic conjuntivitis ) all that flare up and lower reading i know it can come from them but i am treating all those and they have their ups and downs it just seems like the baseline reading vision is consistantly a bit worse and we are trying to decide about calling doc or waiting until june 4 appointment if no further or increased problems . it pretty much sounded to my wife and i that my reading vision would always be a struggle and the low vision aids    are about all i can do right now.i have so many small issues that it becomes a bigger issue overall is how one doc explained it .does a vitrectomy slow down or stop vitreous pulling away ??why would they want to wait if it doesn't cause side effects??my rt eye isn't real helpful to read but since the peel-vitrectomy- i have had no round dots and havent noticed any floaters since ( 1 1/2 years )thanksi realize there are so many issues here-purhaps if nothing else you could refresh us on why my reading close up vision gets worse with age- the doc explained    but with all the other stuff we are mixed up .
1952,i am not fat or anything but i need to lose the little chub around my tummy area! i have been reading online that ephedrine helps a great deal. i admit that i dont work out but i dont have the will to! if anyone could help on where to buy the medicine from besides online(it is not illegal where i live yet) i am not trying to use this for a drug or to become addicted to i really just want it to feel better about myself!!!! help
1953,my eyes were always perfect. about 5 months ago, after work my eyes suddenly went blurred, i could not focus clearly on anything further than 3 feet away from me. it was as if it would only come in to focus when i came within a certain distance from the object. i saw numerous opticians, doctors and opthamologists and had mixed reports. the optician prescribed me glasses but couldn't explain the sudden blurring of vision. doctors could not explain it either and said that if the glasses helped then i should wear them. then i saw an opthamologist who said my eyes were perfect and that i should never have been prescribed glasses in the first place! at that stage i got a ct scan down and everything was clear, i also had blood tests done and nothing came back unusual. it is now months after and my eyes are still blurred, especially if i am tired. i have also had a constant headache for the past 3 weeks that i cant seem to shake. what do you think is wrong with me?
1954,if masturbation doesn't hurt you then why are you getting thin day by day while doing it?this discussion is related toside effects of masturbation.
1955,sounds like this past week was a little stressful and trying on most of us.    let's try making three positive affirmations of things we will do this week to turn it around!remember .. our brain believes what we tell it!    so, if we tell it we're going to succeed we will .. if we keep thinking of failure, it becomes a higher possibility.ready .. set ... go ... three positive affirmations!!!!    yes .. we can do this!
1956,i realized that on bright lights or on object with a light or shinning on it i see it almost double vision but not fully. exsample on car lights i see the light extended.could this be a medical problem?also does double vision mean you need glasses or is that mean something is wrong with a person health?
1957,as i've started to answer questions here at medhelp.org, i'm flabbergasted about the number of readers that are looking for hcg injections for weight loss.hcg injections do not cause weight loss. i'm sorry to burst all your bubbles, but it just doesn't.for dozens of years these have been specifically not allowed by the fda for treatment of obesity and weight loss. i recall that it's sometimes prescribed as part of infertility treatments and ivf, though. here's the link to fda guidance about those wanting to advertise about hcg injections fda requires all labeling and advertising of hcg to state that it has not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of obesity. the ads must also state that hcg is not approved by fda as safe and effective in treatment of obesity of weight control.hmm..odd...
1958,my son is 1 year and 4 months. he has arthiritis. it has affected his left knee and toe. he is being treated by a pediatric rheumatologist in pakistan who has also worked in australia. he gets injected with methotrexate weekly. his blood tests are repeated every 3 weeks. his esr has reduced from 80 to 17. his haemoglobin had been affected a little but with iron supplements it is fine now. we also give him folic acid.now i am only concerned with his sgpt(alt) level. it was normal for a long time.his injections statred with 0.1 cc for one month, 0.2 cc for 3 weeks, 0.3 cc for 3 weeks and 0.4 cc for another 3 weeks.his sgpt was 15, 15, 20, 30 and after the last test it was 82    i.u/l.let me tell you that just ten days before this test he had 2 antibiotics for his infected tonsils.could that have elevated his sgpt? is this level dangerous? what other tests should be performed to check for any problems or should we wait and get it tested a few weeks later?thankyou,romana.
1959,my son's sight was just tested and he has 20/30 vision.    it's not perfect but it's not bad either.    the optometrist said he can probably see fine but if he sits far from the board at school, he may have difficulty reading it.    my son plays little league and will be playing basketball in the fall.    i wanted to get some advise on whether i should get him prescription glasses.    should i wait until he is complaining that he is having difficulty seeing things or get a mild prescription for him now.    i don't think it affects his sports but who knows if he'll do better if he has clearer vision.    please advise.    thanks!
1960,editor's note: paul rieckhoff is an iraq veteran, the founder and executive director of iraq and afghanistan veterans of america (iava) and the author of chasing ghosts. follow him on twitter @paulrieckhoff.(cnn) -- imagine you served for one year with the u.s. army in iraq. imagine you served an additional tour in afghanistan a year later.and imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your humvee rolled by. your buddy sitting next to you was killed. after you left the army and returned home, you had trouble focusing. you had headaches and issues with your vision. you realize you returned with what might be a traumatic brain injury. and maybe post-traumatic stress disorder, too.imagine you also have two kids younger than 7 who haven't seen you very much for the last half decade. imagine you're struggling to find a job. you've got a lot on your plate. and you're understandably stressed.you don't want to let down your family. and you don't want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies.you summon the courage to overcome the stigma, and you go to your local department of veterans affairs to get some help. you file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially. you're hopeful.now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the department of veterans affairs. 600 days.600 days of staring at your mailbox. 600 days of phone calls to check in. 600 days of bills piling up. 600 days of disappointment.sounds crazy, right? well, for thousands of veterans nationwide, it's real life.if you are a young vet who's filed a claim with the department of veterans affairs in new york or los angeles, you will wait an average of 600 days. and you're not alone.more than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic logjam that, in 2013, is the almost too absurd to believe. after 10 years of war, three va secretaries, and an increase in the overall department budget of 40% since 2009, an incredible 97% of veteran's claims are still on paper.yep, paper.america has soldiers in nevada piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away, but 97% of our veterans' benefits claims are still on paper.earlier this month, the center for investigative reporting released a leaked internal va document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years: the va backlog problem is even worse than reported.the va has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days. for the first claim filed, it's longer: 316 to 327 days. in los angeles, that figure is 619. in new york, it's 642. in indianapolis, it's 612 days. and vets with first-time claims in reno, nevada, wait 681 days.the va has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors, but it has failed to report that, because of staff turnover, the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010. and, in chicago; waco, texas; and oakland, california, the overall number of claims processors has gone down.since the internal documents were leaked last week, we've yet to see a public response from va secretary eric shinseki or from the commander in chief.some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in iraq and afghanistan. but now, a decade later, president barack obama is not answering their calls for help. and the public still doesn't seem to get it.that's why this week i'm joining veterans from across america as we take our stories to washington.veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the capitol to storm the hill, where we'll be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backlog. you can see their faces and read about their stories at the iraq and afghanistan veterans of america website, www.iava.org. they are an amazing group of men and women (and one dog) that have overcome tremendous obstacles. and now, they're taking on another one: the va backlog.just like we've been trained, we won't quit until the job is done. no matter how long it takes, we'll keep fighting.our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices. and every single american should stand with us to #endthevabacklog once and for all.ten years after the start of the iraq war, there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops. now is the time for them to show it.http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/19/opinion/rieckhoff-veteran-benefit-logjam/index.html?hpt=hp_c2
1961,koch industries, the wichita, kan.-based company run by the billionaire koch brothers, sent a voter information packet to 45,000 employees of its georgia pacific subsidiary earlier this month.in it was a letter, dated oct. 1, from koch industries president dave robertson implicitly warning that many of our more than 50,000 u.s. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences of voting for president obama and other democrats in the 2012 elections, a list of conservative candidates the company's political action committee endorses and a pair of editorials: one, by david koch, supporting mitt romney, and the other, by charles koch, condemning obama.while we are typically told before each presidential election that it is important and historic, i believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of america future generations will inherit, robertson's letter--first published by inthesetimes.com--begins. if we elect candidates who want to spend hundreds of billions in borrowed money on costly new subsidies for a few favored cronies, put unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses, prevent or delay important new construction projects, and excessively hinder free trade, then many of our more than 50,000 u.s. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills. this is true regardless of what your political affiliation might be.robertson's letter continued:(in these times)to help you engage in the political process, we have enclosed several items in this packet. for most of you, this includes information about voter registration deadlines and early voting options for your state. at the request of many employees, we have also provided a list of candidates in your state that have been supported by koch companies or by the kochpac, our employee political action committee.i want to emphasize two things about these lists. first, and most important, we believe any decision about which candidates to support is -- as always -- yours and yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you. second, we do not support candidates based on their political affiliation. we evaluate them based on who is the most market-based and willing to support economic freedom for the benefit of society as a whole.if you are concerned about our economy, our future and enhancing the quality of life for all americans, then i encourage you to consider the principles of your candidates and not just their party affiliation. it is essential that we are all informed and educated voters. our future depends on it.it's not the first time koch industries has sent employees political packets. just before the 2010 midterm elections, koch sent staffers an urgent mailer that the nation said was full of alarmist right-wing propaganda.last week, david siegel, the founder and ceo of florida-based westgate resorts, sent an email to employees informing them that layoffs are likely if obama is reelected:it's quite simple. if any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, as our current president plans, i will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company. rather than grow this company i will be forced to cut back. this means fewer jobs, less benefits and certainly less opportunity for everyone.so, when you make your decision to vote, ask yourself, which candidate understands the economics of business ownership and who doesn't? whose policies will endanger your job? answer those questions and you should know who might be the one capable of protecting and saving your job. while the media wants to tell you to believe the 1 percenters are bad, i'm telling you they are not. they create most of the jobs. if you lose your job, it won't be at the hands of the 1%; it will be at the hands of a political hurricane that swept through this country.as gawker noted, siegel and his wife were the subjects of the queen of versailles, a recent documentary about their ongoing quest to build the largest house in america. and siegel has often claimed credit for george w. bush's victory over al gore in the 2000 presidential race. (i had my managers do a survey on every employee [8,000 total], siegel told bloomberg businessweek. if they liked bush, we made them register to vote. but not if they liked gore.)siegel and the koch brothers are not alone in issuing anti-obama missives to employees. according to msnbc, arthur allen, chief executive of asg software solutions, wrote a similar email to his staffers on sept. 30:many of you have been with asg for over 5, 10, 15, and even 20 years. as you know, together, we have been able to keep asg an independent company while still growing our revenues and customers. but i can tell you, if the us re-elects president obama, our chances of staying independent are slim to none. i am already heavily involved in considering options that make our independence go away, and with that all of our lives would change forever. i believe that a new president and administration would give us citizens and the world the renewed confidence and optimism we all need to get the global economies started again, and give asg a chance to stay independent. if we fail as a nation to make the right choice on november 6th, and we lose our independence as a company, i don't want to hear any complaints regarding the fallout that will most likely come.in the email, allen added: i am asking you to give us one more chance to stay independent by voting in a new president and administration on november 6th.http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/koch-industries-sends-pro-romney-packet-employees-195709471--election.html
1962,despite having had many incomplete (they didn't get the back) and painful pap smears over the years, a gynecologist has only now discovered that my wife has a vagina which is at a high angle to the cerix so pap smears need special equipment and why intercourse in the few time we had it was uncomfortable at best. so    is there a good postion for intercourse that she will most likely enjoy ?
1963,http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2012did anyone watch the state of the union address last night?    what did you think of it?personally, i agreed with a lot of what the president had to say.    yes, there were some philosophical difference, but nothing really sent me reeling until i heard the statement... no bailouts... no hand outs.... (and i think he added no excuses)    to me, it seemed like he was almost trying to say that the bailouts of the auto industry and the banking establishment were bad ideas.    he didn't come right out and say it, but he did say that we (the american tax payer) are not going to do that ever again.as for the part that was along the lines of no excuses... my mind rushed straight to the talk of the bail outs and stimulus package might not be enough.hand outs?    solyndra....pretty much everything else was okay, but as i mentioned some philosophical differences that were expected.
1964,for the past couple of months i get little red dots on the head of my penis, but they are not bumps or anything they are completely flat, and they go away within a few days, sometimes i get it after having sex or when i dont shower. i went to a little clinic today and the doctor said it might be herpes but ive seen pictures and symptoms of herpes and they dont look like it, and i have no symptoms at all, the red dots dont hurt or anything i just get them here and there, what do you think it could be?
1965,i am 27 yrs old.my ophthalmologist said that i have a +0.50 cyl. and 90* axis in my both eye but 6/6 vision and that i should wear glasses while working on comp or watching tv or doing my art work (as these things cause stress).they suggested me that i don't need to wear glasses otherwise.i want to know is my eyesight really weak ?.are there any eye exercises that can prevent me from wearing glasses.? should i take any precaution ?

1967,i went to the doctor 2 months ago over my ears bothering me.    mostly they were just a bit achy but i would get an occasional pain down in my ear/jaw pain, and even eye pain when chewing.    my doctor said i had a lot of fluid behind my ears and that my right eardrum looked really dull.    he assumed my issues were also being cause by a sinus infection as i had some throat irritation as well.i took antibiotics for 2 weeks and i'm still having problems.    haven't went back to the doctor about this yet.    my left ear bothers me some but mainly my troubles are on the right side.    i keep getting this tingling feeling back in my right ear and i sometime feel like i have fluid in my ear.    also have some achiness in front of my ear at what i believe is my jaw and there seems to be a small knot there - when it's bothering me the pain goes up to my temple and sometimes behind my right eye.    when i wake up in the morning usually that's when it feel the best, but by the end of the day even my face aches.    also, in the afternoon, i can't even get a q-tip in either ear - it's not like that in the morning.    any idea what could be going on?

1969,we have a 12 year old son.. he is taking adderall(adderrall)for add and it seems to help with his concentration. however nothing matters to this child. he is in the 2 nine weeks at school and for the 3rd time we have just discovered he is not completing homework, classwork, or if he does it is failing to turn it in and then loses it as he is horribly disorganized. he seems to make everything so much harder on himself than it needs to be. he has been told he will do the work. and in the past he has had to make up the work as we told him he would. he has also acted out and had in school suspension, (shocked us as he has never acted out before to the degree he did). how do we help him? he may never see the light of day after he gets home from school today. it's no way to be a kid.

1976,i realize this is very vague but perhaps you have some general information regarding my question. on two different occasions, with two different ophthalmologists, my husband was told he had a scar on his eye. each time the question of head trauma came up (he did fall from a height of about twenty feet years ago, resulting in an undiagnosed concussion --    he experienced nausea and vomiting for several days post-injury --    and back problems). my husband never asked whether the scar was on the retina, the lens, the cornea, etc. so, does anyone have an idea where those examiners may find such a scar and what may have caused it?thank you in advance for any and all efforts.rjr

1987,does tylenol worsen asthma for kids?npr 20 feb 2012http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/02/20/147002356/does-tylenol-worsen-asthma-for-kidsparents and doctors around the world have been alarmed by the dramatic increase in childhood asthma.one factor in the upswing is better detection by doctors, but at least one doctor thinks a common over-the-counter drug also has something to do with it.dr. john mcbride sees lots of kids with asthma. he's a pediatric pulmonologist at akron children's hospital in ohio. he knew of studies that raised concern about the safety of acetaminophen    brand name tylenol    to treat colds and fever in kids with asthma. so he decided to look more closely at the research.i was stunned, he says. all the studies he looked at showed a link between asthma and acetaminophen.the more acetaminophen somebody takes, the more likely it is that they have asthma, he says. also, there's an incredible consistency. everybody around the world who's looked for this association has been able to find it.in asthma, the airways of the lungs get blocked by mucous and narrow. that leads to wheezing and shortness of breath. the rise in asthma has closely paralleled the increased use of acetaminophen.there are no scientific studies proving the medication causes asthma, but mcbride says it may make asthma worse in kids who already have it.nine-month-old martez coughs and wheezes as mcbride examines him and talks with his mom, ceasha moorer, about his asthma. he coughs. he wheezes. there are multiple symptoms, she says. he works very hard to breathe. when he's excited from crawling or even laughing, then he breathes really hard.in the past when martez got a cold, moorer gave him tylenol. but that seemed to make his symptoms worse. at mcbride's suggestion, she stopped using it. then one day, her aunt was looking after martez when he had a cold.i told her don't give him tylenol, moorer says. i didn't specify that it was acetaminophen. she actually gave him a cold medicine, but it seemed to make him kind of worse. i looked at the active ingredients and acetaminophen was in the active ingredients.in fact, acetaminophen is an ingredient in many cough and cold products    including nyquil, robitussin and theraflu. it might exacerbate the asthma because it decreases levels of a molecule called glutathione, which protects the lungs.so removing the beneficial effect of glutathione exactly at a time children's lungs are being irritated might end up being just one factor that contributes to the onset of an asthma attack, mcbride says.mcbride's recommendation? don't give acetaminophen to a child who has asthma. other doctors say it's too soon for that advice.many other factors could play a role in the rise of asthma, according to dr. stanley szefler, head of pediatric pharmacology at national jewish health in denver. vitamin d insufficiency, dietary changes, air pollution or better control of infections are perhaps all related to the increasing prevalence of asthma, he says.johnson & johnson, maker of tylenol, said in a statement that the medicine has been used safely and effectively for more than 50 years. there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies that show a causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, and asthma, the company said.it's important to control a child's fever, szefler says. mcbride agrees but says ibuprofen is a safer bet    at least until ongoing studies provide answers about the safety of acetaminophen for kids with asthma.

1989,i think that alcon -restor iol's have shown their true colors. i don't trust a thing they would say as in regards to impovements, i had restor in june.    the fight is on to get the fda to stop these manufacturers.    if you feel the same, i think a action must be started.    again i'll say contact the fda adverse reactions site and report your iol to them. letters need to be sent to the fda as well as phone calls. i will find the necessary sites and numbers if anyone is interested.i think fool was written across my forehead.    the same thing happened to me in regards to the tmj implants 25 years ago. they were marketed without proper fda approval and a 100% recall was issued.    talk about having to pay the price. you'd think i'd know better.what are your comments.b.
1990,when she told me she was sick, i thought she was exaggerating. she had just attended my sons 4th birthday party march 9th. she seemed fine then. then she was at my house telling me she knew something was wrong. she told me about her life insurance policy. i thought she had a bad flue and she was gonna be ok. all of the doctors she saw told her she was just having back spasms. she went to the emergency room on march 21. they gave her an mri, and found cancer. she had stage 4 lung cancer. it had spread to her spine, endocrine system, and her brain. the doctors told us that there was nothing they could do. she was put on radiation therapy for ten days. i took her every day, she was rapidly loosing her mind. the time the doctors gave at first was up to 6 months, then it was no more than 4 months. then they told us she could go any time. she died april 16. i miss her, my son misses her. my question is how can i help my 4 1/2 year old son cope with her loss. he keeps telling me he misses her, and asking when we will see her again. i tell him not for a long time. i also am having a hard time dealing with the fact that i wasn't at her bedside when she died, i couldn't make myself go there. i knew she was going to die but i didn't go to her. i feel so selfish, why couldn't i be with my mom when she left. i will always regret that.

1996,i went to the eye doctor yesterday, and i got a prescription for restasis for my dry eyes. along with that, i got a prescription for lotemax, for more immediate relief (to help prevent inflammation i guess). i remember that my doctor said to put one drop of the restasis in my eyes once in the morning, and once at night, but i can't remember what he said for the lotemax. i think he said one drop in each eye four times a day, but i might be thinking of theratears, which we didn't get. does four times a day sound like too much? it makes me nervous to use it because they said it was a steroid, so i definitely don't want to use it too much. i'm 19 years old, and i've worn glasses since i was 9 (and i live in the desert), if that helps.
1997,i went to the dentist on wednesday 04/02/08 to have old fillings removed and i did have a cavity which was cleaned out.    that afternoon...the feelings came back except for the left side of my tongue...it feels swollen at times and definitely numbness is there....burning sensation at times and i cannot taste food on that side.    i was brushing my teeth and tongue on that side and i could feel the heavyness of the toothbrush but not the sensation like the right side of my tongue.    this is quite annoying...and after reading from others who are having the same problem i am hopeful that this will eventually subside or go away.    is there any thing i can do to hurry up the process?.this discussion is related totongue and jaw numbness after lower wisdom extraction.
1998,for the past 3 days i have had numbness and pain on the left side of my face, primarily around the eye, cheekbone and cheek.    one day after this pain began i developed a mouth ulcer on the left side of my hard palate.    i have no symptoms of sinus infection (absolutely no congestion), no eye tearing, no symptoms of a palsy.    my left eye hurts a little when i blink, my face hurt to touch and the pain stops on the left side of my nose.    a couple of years ago i developed a similar feeling of numbness and tingling on one side of my face, from my scalp across the left side down to my neck.    at that time i went to the er to have a stroke ruled out.    those symptoms resolved after about 3 days and have returned periodically (2-3 times a year).    this time seems to be a little worse, with more pain and the mouth ulcers.    i have racked my brain (and the internet) trying to figure out what's up.    any ideas?    thanks for your help
1999,i had tecnis multifocal lens implanted about 1 month ago.    i am having halos, glare, lack of contrast in colors, diminished depth perception, things look hazy, but my near vision is ok.    surgeon thinks it is due to astigamatism and wants to do prk to correct it, but he thinks it may not make me happy.    he thinks i should consider removing that lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.should i expect the vision problems to decrease over time.    i was hoping to have perfect vision, but is that not realistic?    i was wondering if others have experienced these problems and had them go away, over time, or if this is, unfortunately, normal for lens implants.    should i get the implants removed.please help
2000,story highlightsalligator was trapped inside school by wildlife expertsstuart middle school is near the hillsborough riverit's currently gator mating season(cnn) -- looking for love, or perhaps just for some cafeteria food or spelling lessons, an alligator was found monday inside a middle school in suburban tampa, florida.tampa police were notified around 7 a.m. that the gator had set itself down in a prime spot, in front of the cafeteria in stuart middle school, the department said in a written statement.although school does not let out for another week, no children were inside the school when the reptile was discovered, said hillsborough county school district spokesman steve hegarty.the school is near the hillsborough river, so it's not too far-fetched to think an alligator might make its way inside, hegarty said. still, he doesn't recall any similar incidents.the gator was contained in one of the hallways, police said. trappers from the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission caught the creature. no one was injured.it's currently alligator mating season. according to the conservation commission's website, alligator courtship begins in early april, with mating occurring in may or june.

2002,my nine yr old daughter has been 'trading' many of her toys in which she always gives expensive items away in exchange for 'bubble gum machine' items. when i find this out, i make her return the items and get her things back, but i think most of the time i am unaware of it, until i realize something is missing. i suspect she traded her nintendo ds, since it vanished a while back. she recently confessed when i was looking for my $400.00 heart diamond necklace, that she traded it to the 9 yr old neighbor boy for $1.00. of course, the boy can't seem to find it, so i will not get this back. the boy's mother believes the boy, when he told her that my daughter kept pesting him for the trade. my daughter tells me that he was the one coaxing her to get the necklace. i believe her. she has been trading expensive items with this same boy quite often, in which i made her go to his house and get her items back. the mother said she was not aware of all of the trading going on. first i want to say, i thought i was a good mother. my kids never went without anything, for the most part, they have more than most of their friends have. my questions are: why does my daughter not understand or seem to care about the value of things. why does she continue to do this? i ground her and take her things away for punishment, but she does it again. in my opinion, i think my neighbors 9 yr old boy was wrong also, and i think they should offer to help pay for the loss. am i wrong here? the response i got from the mother is that her children would never lie, cheat or steal, and they seem to doubt the value of my necklace, since i have no receipt. this necklace had alot of diamonds and a very good chain. i feel betrayed by my own daughter, she said she is sorry, but i really don't think she understands the value and the wrong doing. i am very stressed over this and need some good advice. thanks!
2003,http://inplainsight.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/22/17840373-poverty-in-america-millions-of-families-too-broke-for-bank-accounts?litesabino fuentes-sanchez hid $25,000 all around his house because he didn't trust banks. lasonia christon receives her wal-mart salary on a pre-paid debit card. kim james was homeless for most of the past decade in part because she had no place to save money.there are plenty of reasons people still live all-cash lives, but the sheer number who do it might surprise you. at a time when the majority of americans use online banking, and some even deposit checks using their cellphone cameras, roughly eight percent of america's 115 million households don  t have a checking or savings account, according to census data compiled by the fdic.the numbers are far higher among minorities: more than 20 percent of african-americans and hispanics are essentially left out of the american banking system.frozen in the cash-only past, they face myriad   kick-them-while-they-are-down   situations where getting money costs money. banks typically charge $6 to cash checks. want to secure an apartment? fee-based money orders are the only option. without credit cards, they must turn to triple-digit interest rate payday loans for emergencies.span>lasonia christon of jackson, miss., tries to avoid getting paid in checks, but when her state tax refund for $231 arrived recently, she had to pay $7 to cash it at a nearby convenience store.christon works at wal-mart. her paychecks are deposited onto a prepaid debit card -- an improvement over old-fashioned paper paychecks, which led to high check-cashing fees. it  s hardly a good substitute for direct deposit, however. one cash withdrawal per period is free, but others cost $2. she can avoid the fee by shopping at wal-mart and getting cash back at checkout.she is among the 60 percent of unbanked americans who previously had a checking account. christon used to share one with her sister, but it cost her dearly.there was an overdraft here and an overdraft there, and it just didn't work out, she said.kim james at the dove house, a half-way house in durham, nc that helped her get back on her feet after struggles with poverty and addiction.fuentes-sanchez made a fairly good living working for a tree removal company in lumber bridge, n.c., for about 10 years. but he was skeptical of banks, and when he tried to open an account, he was surprised by the cost.instead of making money, i would have to pay fees, he said, through a translator. (so) we used to keep money in the house. we were always trying to look for ways to hide the money in the house and keep it safe.at one time, fuentes-sanchez had $25,000 stashed in different places throughout the house    his latino community had been plagued by house burglaries because neighbors did the same. when his wife got cancer, her treatments devoured all their savings. down to their last $500, and before she passed away, she convinced him to open a bank account at latino community credit union, which was opened in part to help stem the burglary problem.  she managed the money, and was disciplined enough to avoid spending it, said fuentes-sanchez, 37, who now raises five children alone. (i) sometimes see something and i am tempted to buy it ... now the money is in the bank.  saving -- putting money out of temptation's reach -- is the core concept of consumer banking. but the importance of participating in the financial system has stretched far beyond the quaint notion of interest, said jennifer tescher, ceo of the center for financial services innovation, who is generally regarded as the person responsible for popularizing the term unbanked.a bank account in a way has become like a passport or a driver's license, said tesch. it's a kind of access device.james, 55, has been in and out of homelessness for several years.    she now lives at a half-way house called dove house in durham, n.c., and figured she could never move into her own apartment unless she could stash away the money needed for a security deposit. without a savings account, that was a challenge.cash in hand is cash spent, my mother always said, she said.two years ago, she met duke university student janet xiao, who was part of a group named the community empowerment fund, which visited dove house offering life skills training, including a class on personal finance where she nudged women to open a bank account.    james was reluctant.it's really demoralizing to open up an account and have it sitting in there with no money in it, xiao said.   i think most folks want to take one step at a time, and get a job first. also, there is this fear of being charged fees you don't understand.  when james got a part-time job in january, she finally took up xiao  s offer of help.    the two set up an account with the self-help credit union on xiao  s laptop right at the dove house kitchen table.she even put the first $5 in there for me, james said. after depositing her first paycheck in person at self-help, xiao said, james did a little dance.  now whenever i get even $10 or $20, i go to the bank and deposit it,   james said. within a few months, she put together enough to pay her security deposit and first  s month  s rent. as soon as she saves enough for a bed, she  ll move in.james has been able to start banking again through the self help credit union, and has saved enough to pay a security deposit and the first month's rent for her own apartment..'saving for the future'self-help is part of a growing set of financial companies called community development financial institutions (cdfis). supported by the u.s. treasury department, their mission is to help the unbanked get into the financial system.  you make sure people are getting products and services they need,   said mark pinsky ,ceo of the opportunity finance network, which helps fund cdfis.   banks may be the best place, they may not, but we don't want to just leave them vulnerable to the predators out there.  christon has recently been persuaded to open an account in a different way. her 3-year-old twins   day-care facility was recently visited by representatives of the mississippi college savings account program, who helped her open a small account for the children. she then realized she needed her own savings account.i want to be a good role model for them, so they can learn about savings, she said.    i know i need to be better and show them about saving for the future.

2007,oops!    this is the first time i have ever posted on a site, and i forgot to give prospective posters more information; please forgive me.my 47-year-old sister has been drinking heavily for the last 20 years.    about a month ago, during her sixth detox in a year, she suffered a seizure and was out of her head (wet brain?) for about twelve hours in er.    the hospital ran all sorts of tests and said that her liver enzymes were elevated and the seizure was alcohol-related.    a week ago her ankles became very swollen (she's only about 100 lbs soaking wet, w/the big alcoholic belly) w/one leg swollen all the way to her knee, became jaundiced, and developed ascites.    her chest is completely covered w/red pimply-looking spider veins.    the doctors drained her abdomen and only retrieved 1.5 liters of liquid.    her abdomen still looked like she was at least seven months pregnant.    the sonographer said she was still very distended because of her enlarged liver.    she's only eating about one small meal a day; she says it kills her to eat.    she must lie down for about an hour after every meal to relieve her pain.    she is sleeping about 11 hours a day; we don't know if it's due to her new night shift or just another symptom of the cirrhosis.    we've yet to hear the results of her procedure (one week later!) so of course i have been searching the internet for answers and thinking the worst.    can anyone offer some answers about what to expect?    thank you.
2008,hello, i have written my question in the adhd forum and someone recommended that i should write it in this one. my question is rather long so i was hoping that you would take a look and reply. it is titled the same as this one. adhd or bad behaviour?? posted yesterday. thanks i need some feedback.
2009,washington (cbs/ap) it may sound like a james bond gadget, but the fda has just approved a miniature telescope - smaller than a pea - that can help with a leading cause of blindness for seniors when implanted inside the eye.how does it work?surgeons put the implantable miniature telescope in one eye, allowing the person to improve central vision for tasks like reading, watching tv and recognizing faces. doctors leave the other eye alone to provide peripheral vision.http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20009834-10391704.html?tag=latestthe trick here is that the brain must fuse the two different views into a single image. the food and drug administration says patients will need post-surgery rehabilitation to make that happen.the invention doesn't work for everyone.according to dr. malvina eydelman, the fda's ophthalmic devices chief, the device is specifically geared for a subset of the nearly 2 million americans with advanced macular degeneration - those 75 and older, with a certain degree of vision loss, who also need a cataract removed.in a 219-patient study, the fda said 90 percent of telescope recipients had their vision improve by at least two lines on an eye chart, and three-quarters went from severe to moderate vision impairment.it's not a miracle cure cautioned ophthalmic surgeon dr. kathryn colby of harvard and the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary in bostonwe're not giving people back 20-year-old eyes, she said.but by magnifying images onto more of the retina than its diseased center, someone who before couldn't see an entire face might now miss only the nose, said colby, who helped lead manufacturer visioncare ophthalmic technologies' study of the implant.and it's not risk free.concern about damage to the inside lining of the cornea, the eye's clear front covering that helps focus light, held up fda approval for several years. in that study, 10 eyes had serious corneal swelling, five that required corneal transplants. fda's eydelman said the company proposed candidate restrictions to minimize that risk, and will study how an additional 770 recipients fare after sales begin.in fact, the fda took the highly unusual step of requiring that patients and their surgeons sign a detailed acceptance of risk agreement before surgery, acknowledging potential side effects -- including corneal damage and worsened vision -- and the need for lots of testing to determine who's a candidate.visioncare, of saratoga, calif., is seeking medicare coverage for the surgery and rehab costs, a package that it calls centrasight. the company wouldn't estimate total costs but said the device itself costs $15,000.
2010,i'm. engaged to be married and expecting a little girl in early july. i've been with my fiance for a year and a half. at the beginning of our relationship he hung out with an old friend of mine. well they both didn't tell me about that til 2 days later!! but now i just don't know what to do!! i feel that he's been lieing to me about websites that i know he's been on and also lately ever since we found out i was pregnant he's changed a lot!! he's been only thinking about himself and when he doesn't is when we're around friends and it irritates me!! i just don't know what to do anymore!! can someone please give me some advice!?
2011,an essays is usually a short piece of writing which is often written from an author's personal point of view. essays can consist of a number of elements, including: literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. the definition of an essay is vague, overlapping with those of an article and a short story. almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays

2015,(reuters) - big bang theory physicist dr. sheldon cooper has a buzzy new claim to fame. the geeky tv character, who counts britain's stephen hawking among his online friend, has had a species of bee named after his favorite catch phrase - bazinga!brazilian biologist andre nemesio said he named a species of brazilian orchid bee 'euglossa bazinga' in honor of the clever, funny, 'nerd' character sheldon cooper because the bee had tricked scientists for some time with its similarity to other species.nemesio published his paper last month in zootaxa, a journal for worldwide zoological taxonomists.steven molaro, one of the executive producers of the big bang theory said on wednesday that the cbs comedy was always extremely flattered when the science community embraces our show.sheldon would be honored to know that euglossa bazinga was inspired by him. in fact, after   mothra' and griffins, bees are his third-favorite flying creatures, molaro said.the big bang theory - a comedy about a group of brilliant but socially awkward scientists - is one of the most popular comedies on u.s. television, attracting about 18 million viewers an episode.actor jim parsons has won two emmys for his lead performance as cooper.source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/us-bigbangtheory-bee-idusbre90201720130103

2017,my son is 26 months/ 2 years and 2 months old.    the past week, we've noticed he's begun blinking his eyes in sequence about 4-5 times in 2-3 sets.    we notice it when he watches television or is playing with his toys; it is more noticeable at night.    is it allergies?    is it tics?    what can this be?    we don't have a history of tourette's.    i do wonder that when he is at his daycare that they clean so often with strong detergents?    please help us figure this out; he is our only child.

2019,my 4 year old runs around all the time when playing and sweats ,is always thirsty and urinates a lot,doesnt sit for a rest and his face goes bright red
2020,i have a seven year old daughter that screams until i'm at wits end, won't go to her time outs, and could care less about having stuff taken away/or play dates.    in fact, if you take something away, a few days later she's looking for it and doesn't seem to have any clue that it was taken away in punishment.    my husband and i now scream ourselves - i know just makes it worse, have spanked her - still no change and yes i don't know if it's right or wrong, put soap in her mouth and so on.    her behavior doesn't change, but ours has.    i feel like we're getting worse and that she's going to be emotionally messed up because that's how i feel right now.    i remain calm for a few days and then it's just a cycle.    i know i need to go to counseling - for her and i.    i guess i just needed to talk this out.    if anyone has any other advice.    i mean she's a wonderful girl except when she absolutely looses it.    i never thought i used to loose it, but now i do and i feel i'm behaving worse than she is because i'm the adult and i know better.    she calls herself stupid and we absolutely have never said this to her.    it's a forbidden word, but she's anything but.    so for all you parent's wondering if they are doing it at a young age should you get help.    yes, because it doesn't necessarily change with age.
2021,my 2 1/2 year old makes herself so upset, when she doesn't get her way or sometimes of reasons i'm not sure, that she makes herself actually throw up. sometimes we just give in to her so she won't throwup. is this normal? what should i do?

2023,my 6 yr old son is afraid of everything. he won't go be in a room by himself even if i'm right next door. he follows me around constantly because he is afraid to be alone. he talks about ghosts a lot. he's not add or on any medication. he is driving me crazy with these fears. i can't even go to the bathroom without him most of the time because he's so afraid. what should i be doing? i've talked to him about his fears and the ghosts. i've asked him to describe them and he usually describes things he's seen on tv. i try not to let him watch even cartoons that may have ghosts in them but it hasn't helped. what should i do with him? i'm so afraid he's missing out on things already because of his fears.
2024,i am male and born 1944,i stopped wearing u/w 1951 aged 7 i absolutely hated underwear.i really don't care if you are male or female,or your kids are b/g please take note of how they feel if they feel more comfortable without wearing underwear let them dress that way.any parent who has concerns over dress codes obviously loves their kids.a parent that found out that i didn't wear underwear was at first disgusted about it,and when her daughter tried it and liked the idea (about 8) mum flew off the deep end so to speak.she started going crook at me over it (i was 14).i told her to try it before you condemn it.that took some time to sink in, but in the long run the whole family (5) got into the no undie club.mum decided that the two boys didn't need any and the three girls only wore short half slips under school clothesand didn't have to wear anything under shorts,long pants (jeans) or long skirts.john the aussie blokethis discussion is related to4 yrd old won't wear underwear.
2025,i know this is a little different than normal. my question is not about my child but my childhood. i have been reading the posts of parents whose children frequently masterbate. i am 31 years old and i am dealing with morbid obeasity. i think it is linked to my childhood masterbation(masturbation). i don't remember when i started i think about 3    but at some point my sister did it with me. i think about 7 or so she is 2 years younger.    i am not sure why or how this started but i would straddle her and rub against her until i got off, at other times she was on top. i also rubbed against anything else i could find. i was obsessed with sex and had sexual thoughts about men in my family. i knew that this was wrong but i couldn't stop it. i always felt like there was something wrong with me and i was bad. i reacently asked my mom if i was sexually abused but she says there is no way because she was too overprotecive. i know this is a long question but i am desprate for an answer. is what i experianced as a child normal or did i sexually abuse my sister?
2026,my boyfriend lost his spouse almost three years ago when she died of a heart attack after putting her kids to bed.    his 10 yr old son has been to my house several times along with his 8 yr old daughter.    his son on three separate occasions has smeared feces on my furniture and bathroom floor.    i discussed this incident with my boyfriend and he had addressed it with his son.    he apparently does this every so often.    i have had several different talks with my boyfriend about this because this behavior is alarming to me.    i have both a background in early childhood and in the medical field.    i believe this is a cry for help and that he may be being sexually abused.    i would like some insight to this and how i should handle this.    i am at a loss for words.    i have talked with my boyfriend telling him that he should talk to his pediatrician and he thinks he has just got a nasty habit.    my boyfriend is 15 yrs older and he is a little set in his ways but, i think he is way off.    i am concerned he does not want to address this issue seeing as his son is 10 and not 2 and playing in poop.    i don't want to ruin my relationship with my boyfriend but, it is concerning me that he won't investigate this more.    am i being paranoid or wrong to think this of his son?    my boyfriend also has mentioned his son he may have a disorder called hirsprung's disease.    he has had intestinal issues since a little boy.    he has seen specialist for this.    by why would he play in his feces?    please, please, please give some insight to this.    thank you for your time.this discussion is related to7 year old boy playing with feces in    school bathroom.
2027,my 5 yr old is also urinating in inappropriate places.    i've read several other cases here on this forum with the same issue.    the only commonality that jumps out at me between these children seems to be that they're all, or at least the majority are, underdeveloped somehow.    my son was 2 months early.    he is developmentally about 6 months behind his peers.    could this be some fruedian desire to remain a baby?    i'm at my wits in.    last week he decided urinating on the hall stairs would be fun.    he soaked the first three stairs.    this morning he promptly got up, and went into his toy room and peed on another one of his carpet squares.    (thank goodness they are carpet squares!)    he pees outside when i'm not looking and the worst was last week when he peed in the middle of my bed!    tips please!    this is unacceptable!    now when guests come over, i'm afraid that i haven't got all the smell out and the house smells like a cat box.    ah yes, the cat box; another of his favorite places to pee!    he also defecates there and does that outside also.this discussion is related tobehavior problem of urinating on toys and carpet.

2029,i need some suggestions for my son with sensory disorder. on my profile i have wrote a little about what is going on and really need some support and help. i would greatly appreciate it!
2030,i have a wonderful 5 year old child he is smart funny imaginative and loving.    but i just don't know what is going on with him.    he is very defiant, he argues with me about everything i tell him to do, he seems to think the rules don't apply to him.    he gets angry very easily and physically lashes out at other kids and my 7 year old daughter. he seems to meet qualifications for many disorders including add, odd, social anxiety disorder intermittant explosive disorder and possibly copbd.    i am taking him for a pysch eva, but i am afraid they may tell me to put him on medication which i am very hesitant to do.    depression bi-polar, and anxiety disorders run rampant in my family.    i just want him to be happy, and to grow up having a happy fulfiling life.    i try not to spank as i think this reinforces agressive behavior, i have tried time out but he kicked his bedroom window out, flipped his tv off the dresser, and destroyed his room.    recently our cat had kittens and one of them scratched him so he threw the kitten against the wall causing it to have a seizure and a broken leg.    i punished him by not allowing him to play in his baseball game the next day and not going outside for three days.    the thing that concerns me the most is that this is really not his nature. he is very kind, affectionate and loving, it seems almost like he suddenly turns into another kid. i try to stcik to my rules but every single thing with him is a battle.    i want him to go to counseling after his eval and he will recieve in school counseling in the fall. i would even like to take a parenting class for parents with difficult children.    another thing that i think could possibly be related is he will only poop in his pants, he pees in the toilet just fine, but he will poop in his pants whenever wherever and he won't even tell me it happened he just goes on about his playing untill i smell him.    i have heard that kids to this as a form of control, but i don't understand why.    i took him to the doc. and he gave me a stool softner but he refuses to take it.    his sense of tasts and smell have always been very keen, and he can tell if i try to mix it in his juice or cereal.    i just wish i could help him and find out why he is so mad all of the time.
2031,he is 6 years old. he did not send him to school for 6 months because of we have shifted some other place.    earlier he went to school without giving trouble to us.    now he is crying everyday to go to school.    he is not at all showing any interest to go to school and he is telling that he wants to sit in the home only and want to talk to his mother.    the teacher complained that he is crying continuously.he has a language problem.    in school they are teaching in english, some times he is unable to understand it.please give us an suggestion that how will we send him to school.    he is going to school since 10 days.
2032,hi, i m 23yrs old. my weight is 40 to 41 kg. my height is 5.16 feet. i want to know the possible ways to increase weight. my mom says i should eat proper nutrional food, but i only eat when i feel like to eat. i m not used to take breakfast, if i take breakfast i feel like i ll vomit. sometimes at weekends, i skip lunches too because i dont feel hungry sometimes. but when i m hungry, i eat alot. i dont eat cheese, same vomit feelings come if i eat it, i dont like to have creals or oats. i knw i m doing wrong with myself therefore i want to knw the other alternative to have balanced diet. some help would be appreciable.
2033,my 9 yr old son was treated for hirshprung's disease at 8 months old. since the procedure we've always had a problem with him pooping his pants. he has now resorted to lying about it, hiding the underwear, not cleaning himself properly, and just not telling anyone that he's messed himself. he does not respond to any punishment or praise. my wife and i have recently received custody of him and his sister. he has been diagnosed with adhd, and his currently taking concerta for this disorder. i am at my wits end. my next step is referring to a child psychologist to find out what may be an underlying problem since taking all of his toys, games, and other fun items away from him. when asked why he continues to mess himself he only answers i don't know. obviously this is not satisfactory with me. can anyone help me?
2034,please help!    my son, who is 8 and has been diagnosed with sensory integration disorder, has a very strange issue with his belly button and lately with his underarms.    he cannot stand for anyone to touch his belly button, even if he laughs, he says it is very painful.    he holds his hand over his navel even if he has a shirt on, and now he says if his arms are not tight to his body he has a feeling that someone is touching him under his arms and it hurts.    he crys often about this. he cannot write sometimes because of this sensatrion he has. please, can you give me any direction to what i can do to help this little guy?    no one seems to know or have ever heard of this. he is a very bight kid, has a hard time making friends because of the way he acts, even though he cannot help it.    thank you in advance.
2035,i was admitted with appendicitis confirmed with a ct scan.    it was retrocecal and my cecum was more in the middle rather than the over to the right. i wanted a laparoscopic excision, but my surgeon shouted at me when i asked about this and proceeded to do a midline laparotomy.    what were the reasons for not performing a laparoscopic removal?    my surgeon wouldn't tell me, but i am still curious.    i am slim 28 year old male and i am concerned that when i resume my normal activities that i will be at increased risk of a hernia because of this.    thank you.
2036,my child is almost three, very active and behaves dangerously (runs in front of cars, jumps of high things etc.). i am quite sure he has adhd am am very curious about the reason of this. i drank on the first day after conception, smoked during the first 2 weeks and did not start prenatal vitamins until 3 weeks after (of course because i was not aware of pregnancy). the remainder of the pregnancy was extremely healthy. she was one week late (41 weeks) and at check up found she had pooped in the water and heartbeat was not well either. immediately i had to go to the hospital where i was induced, but each time a contraction came the heartbeat would slow down too much. the next morning a c-section was done as the same thing happened when trying again in the morning.could you please tell me if any of these situations could have to do with my daughters behavior ? thank you so muchthis discussion is related toimpulsive 3 1/2 year old.

2038,my son was    diagnosed with adhd 3 mos. ago. he is 13 almost 14 yrs. old, his father and i divorced 6 yrs. ago and we have joint custody of him and our other 9 yr. old son. for 2 yrs. now my 13 yr. does not ever bring books home from school and says he does his homework at school. i have a problem with this because he had to go to summer school last year, and get phone calls from teachers almost every day because he cusses them and wont leave other students alone and disrupts almost every class. well, my wake-up call was in nov. of 08', one of his teachers calls to tell me that he was sitting on another students desk and after several times of telling him to get off of the desk he got up and the top of the desk broke, a screw popped out and hit the teacher in the eye. well, we take him to the dr. and he sends me to a psychiatrist. they ran some tests on him at the hospital and turned out he does have adhd. the dr. prescribed hi,m abilify 2.5mgs. daily. also melatonin at night for good rest, the 1st night on the melatonin he wet the bed. i called the doc back that day and she told me to take him off of the melatonin. still bedwetting occasionally. on april 1 2009 he got very angry because he had to go to the dr. again. and refused to get into my car when i picked him up at his dads, he asked his grandpa(step) where the key to his dads gun cabinet is that he wanted to shoot me or worse himself. i called the police because i can't control him and neither could his step-grandpa.the police made him get in my car and go to the dr. and told us to make sure that all the guns are removed from the dads home. the pediatrician took him off of the abilify and sent us back to therapy, well my son refuses to go there again also. on my week with the boys on 4/28/09 my son was constantly hitting on his little brother so i tried to disapline him by putting him in his room and that did not work, he told me several times he hates me and wishes i would die! hes also telling his little brother to tell me the same thing. i took him to a new psychiatrist yesterday and he says he thinks that he does not have adhd so i am very confused. it is not normal to tell your own mother you hate her let alone, tell her to die. this has been going on for a year now, cursing me all the time, staying out all the time as late as he wants. i feel like i am a failure as a mother and that it is my fault but i know this is another wake-up call for me and i dont what to do and feel like there is nowhere else to turn. the father of my son refuses to go to any doctors with us and i need some advise very, very desperately! keep in mind this psychiatrists insist that i give up my every other week with him, keep him away from his little brother and life should be better for my son if he stays with his dad!!!! not normal to me at all because he is trying to sound like a lawyer instead of a psychiatrist which happens to be a friend of the dads family. please help!!!    thank you, very confused!this discussion is related toaggressive behavior.
2039,i hope someone can help me ...i have been with my partner for the past 11 years, and married for the past 1.5 years.my 14yo step daughter (whom i have known since a young child) has been stealing items and money from her mother, father, myself and others (boarding students at her mother  s house) for almost a year now.    her stealing has escalated over time to the point where 2 weeks ago she was caught using her mother  s credit card that she had apparently been using unbeknownst to anyone for quite some time now.    when she was found out, her mother slapped her in the face and kicked her out of her house.over the past few months, i have approached and given her 'a talking to' on each occasion she had stolen my things (change and cosmetics), but her stealing seems to have escalated.    she seems a bit young in the head for her age, and maybe for this reason, my husband (in my opinion) does not dish out adequate discipline.    even before i learned about the credit card incident, i had stopped trusting her and made it very clear that this was the case.after being kicked out of her mother's house, she arrived on our doorstep wanting to stay.my problem here is that i do not trust her anymore, and for this reason do not want her to stay at our house.    my husband does not care about what i think or feel about this and has insisted that she stay with us regardless.    this may sound like the responsible thing to do, but as i have lost trust in her, this situation is causing me so much stress it is now making me very angry, sick in the stomach, and interfering with my work.because her mother hit her, the authorities are now involved and it looks like they want her to stay at our house away from the mother (i was never consulted). it looks like she's with us to stay indefinitely.as a stepparent i am/feel powerless over this whole saga.    i think this powerlessness and fear (of being stolen from) is contributing toward my anger, and i am now wondering if i have made a bad mistake marrying into this mess.    i saw a counsellor last week who suggested that we seek relationship counselling, but my husband just got angry when i mentioned this - insisting that he has no problem.    trust is something very important to me, but when i tell him that i no longer trust her, he tells me 'to get over it' - as though regaining trust in someone is like getting over a cold or something.if anyone can offer any suggestions i'd appreciate the communication as i really don't know how much more of this i can take...your thoughts are appreciated.
2040,my 3 1/2 year old son has been hitting and biting. my son's father was recently given 50/50 time sharing. my son has been mad at me because of this. he tells me why i left him at his dad's too long. he will not play by himself any more, and stays by my side. when he's trying to show affection he hits me instead. he sleeps with me now and doesn't want to be alone. what is he going through? how can i help him?
2041,my 3 1/2 yr old won't wear pants. it came out of nowhere after having a high fever of 105. degrees, since then, she will not wear any pants, not even comfy sweat pants or pajama pants. she will cry, throw a screaming fit, and constantly try pulling them off, even as we are going out the door. she only wants to wear nightgowns, and she does not want to leave the house, even to go do her favorite activities, i have to force her to leave the house. she would rather go to bed or lay around than get dressed to go somewhere. she will wear shirts though, its just pants that she has a problem with.she keeps giving me different excuses why she doesn't want to wear pants, like she gets too hot, she has a stomach ache, headache, the biggest reason is she says her knees hurt. i tried everything from giving her tylenol to rubbing icy hot on her knees telling her that it will make them feel better. i don't know what to believe, but it seems to be related to the high fever. before that happened, she loved her clothes. when she got a new pair of pants she would practically live in them all day and all night. she would get mad if i had to wash them, so now she is acting the complete opposite out of nowhere. i don't think it is a power struggle, because she is a really good kid and i have alway let her pick out her own clothes, and like i said before, she loved her clothes before this. i think it might have to do with the fever, but i don't know what to do about it since i can't really tell if it is a physical problem, psychological, or both. if you could please send me any advice on what is going on, i would really appreciate it. do you think she could be developing a sensitivity disorder?
2042,7 years after breast cancer, mastectomy, reconstruction & tram flap surgery, i am experiencing tight, wrenching pain when bending over during yoga. sometimes it is on the right side (where there is a large visible bulge when i lay down and lift my head) other times it is directly under the breast area near the sternum. i have had 2 doctors    (my oncologist & a surgeon) tell me it looks like a hernia. the surgeon ordered a cat scan with contrast and that awful tasting barium, and now reports he sees no evidence of hernia, and no other testing indicated. so i am back to sqaure one and out of pocket expenses are rising with no firm answer for what is causing the pain. my original plastic surgeon is not someone i trust as i was never satisfied with the scarring afterward or his follow up on questions i had. i realize that diagnosis is difficult for many doctors but how can you dismiss obvious problems like viselike pain, by saying it's not a hernia, so it must be nothing of concern? that does not make sense. is there anyone out there who is able to help me with this?
2043,the doctor said i am not absorbing any nutritional value from my food intake,and am losing weight i can not afford to lose.i am 52 and weigh only 95 lbs..my average weight is 115,but doctor said i was going to wither away and die. i eat alot of food for a person my size, but can not put any weight on. blood tests revealed nothing out of the ordinary and wanted to know if there is something someone knows to have me get checked or knows about this condition, because my doctor knows not what to do for me. any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!!!
2044,i have had a colostomy for over two years . for many years, my stool was pretty well formed and fairly regular i only had to drink prune juice to have a bowel movement. about three years ago, i started to occasionally have to ask for something to help me (milk of magnesia or lactulose). then, i had surgery through my back to remove kidney stones twice. after the first surgery, i wasn't having bowel movements, so the hospital doctor put me on alternating days milk of magnesia and lactulose. in other words, a laxative every day. this worked fine . then after the second surgery, it started not to work. since then, i have been on different kinds of laxatives. most of them have worked at first and then my stool started turning mushy which is unusual for me. i'm now on lactulose two times a day (15-30 cc. ) this worked well at the beginning, but my stool was very much again which is unusual for me, although it is now becoming usual since i'm on the laxatives. i'm totally paralyzed and have a neurogenic bowel, so my bowel has basically stopped working without the laxatives. now the lactulose is getting so that it's not working as well. i'm just out of point where i don't know what to do. i've asked about irrigation here at the nursing home, but no one seems to know anything about it. what can i do??? what kind of doctor would i see about my colostomy? i've never had any problems, so i've never seen a doctor. if anyone can help me, i would so appreciate it. does anyone irrigate? how do you learn how to do it? do you to where my colostomy is, i always had formed stools until the surgeries. from what i've read, this makes me a good candidate for irrigation. i really need some help here!!!
2045,22year male, i have taken 50mg zoloft once a day and 2mg klonopin once a day for 9 months. i never had brain zaps now i get them everytime especially when i move my head. last time i took my medicibe was 53 days ago and i tappered down. im so scared
2046,i am 53 yrs. old and post-menopausal for 5 years. i am scheduled for an abdominal hysterectomy in july.    i've been told i have a 9 cm uterine fibroid and my uterus is about twice the size it should be.    one ovary was visualized with an abdominal ultra sound, the other could not be visualized by abdominal ultra sound or transvaginally.    if i ever had fibroid(s) previously, i was not aware of them.    the worst menopausal symptoms i've experienced were during peri-menopause.    i had night sweats for a good five or six years and still have them once in a while, but it's certainly bearable.following is what confuses me.    as part of a routine physical, i had labs drawn on a saturday.    on monday, i started feeling really crummy, almost like i was coming down with the flu.    by tuesday and wednesday, i was really aching and chilly.    by late wednesday, i had severe pelvic pain and pressure.    the dr.'s office called on wednesday with the lab results.    i remarked that i was glad they were calling, because something had to be wrong with me, i felt really awful.    they said i had gout!    my uric acid was high which indicated i had gout.    i didn't have symptoms one usually thinks of with gout - no hot joints, just achy all over.    she suggested that since i had never suffered from gout before, sometimes the first flare-up can be scattered.    she also said i was dehydrated.    i explained the symptoms i was experiencing, telling the person it felt like my uterus was going to fall out.    i told her if i hadn't had a period for 5 years, i would swear i was suffering from menstrual cramps.    she said, dehydration could contribute to some of my pain, advised me to over hydrate and if i didn't feel better the next day, to call and come in.i went to the dr's. (gp) office on thursday.    urinalysis revealed red blood cells in my urine.    the np asked if i could be constipated.    (sorry, this is really tmi.) i felt i was having a bowel problem, since i hadn't had a bowel movement for a couple of days.    i'm someone who regularly has at least 2 bms a day, so, after 2 days, i felt this could be a problem.    they x-rayed my abdomen and the np said there didn't appear to be enough there to cause the pain i was experiencing.    she performed a pelvic exam.    she said my uterus was enlarged.    i need to explain here, my past two pap smears have been difficult, if not impossible to accomplish.    in 2007, my gyne missed obtaining any cervical cells to test and didn't even know it until the test came back with nothing to test.    the gyne explained since i was post-menopausal and not sexually active, my uterus had shriveled (my words, not his) and moved up very high.    apparently, my cervix is very small also.    i had two children by c-section. the gyne dilated my cervix and was able to acquire a smear.    the next year, 2008, the gyne np could not get a sample and i opted to try vagifem inserts and they were able to complete the pap smear in january, 2009.    they had to use an extra-long, very thin speculum to perform the pap smears both times. i explain all this because from january to april, my shriveled uterus was now twice the size it should be.the gp np referred me for the abdominal and transvaginal ultra sounds which led me to check in with my gynecologist.    he said i certainly had pathology that warranted a hysterectomy, but he was agreeable to waiting a few months, doing the ultra sounds again, and see where we go from there.    i asked if there was any way he could biopsy the fibroid to make a decision.    he said no, there wasn't anyway to do that except with hysterectomy.    he said he truly doubted there was any malignancy.    he advised that usually, with uterine cancer, post-menopause, there would be bleeding.    he explained, and i know from my own research, fibroids are seldom malignant (1%?), but, he had no explanation as to how or why a fibroid would develop and/or grow so large, post-menopausal.    so, i've opted for the hysterectomy.i know this has gone on way too long, and i apologize.    the internet can be a very good place to perform research, but it also can be a very scary place if you search too much.    i've run onto web sites decrying unnecessary hysterectomies.    the complications they cite are really scary, e.g., nothing to support the bladder and/or bowel after removing the uterus, something call a rectocele, pelvic floor problems.    i don't want to suffer bladder or bowel leakage if it turns out i could have waited to have the hysterectomy.    but, on the other hand, i've also read that sometimes, a malignancy is discovered within a fibroid that would have existed for years before creating problems.    i don't want to wait 6 months or a year only to eventually have the surgery and be told it is malignant after all and if only i had done something sooner...i'd appreciate any thoughts or ideas anyone can contribute.    were all these issues related or just coincidental?    i feel okay now.    ever so often, i feel slight pain in my lower abdomen, a kind of pinching pain.    i will appreciate input from the group.thanks,
2047,i have been very fortunate to work from home and care for my daughter since she was born, she is now turning 3.    sometimes i wonder how we survived this long financially, but we did and we are grateful and feel very blessed.    we have reached a breaking point, and out of financial necesity i need to return to work outside of the home full-time.while from a very large family, i do not have family or friends that can care for alexis while i go to work.    this time in my life, has by far been the most emotional time for me.    my concerns?    many to say the least.    i am afraid my relationship will change with alexis.    she is so attached to me and i feel like i am abandoning her.    how will she possible understand going from being with me twelve hours a day to just a few at night?    how will these daycares ever really understand her and be able to work through the battles that i face with her day-to-day.    i am so sad and so worried this transition is going to be horrible for both of us.in alexis's defense, she loves to play!    and when i say play, i mean all day.    often beyond what i can offer energy wise.    maybe being around kids all day will be good for her.    maybe me getting out of the house will be good for me.    has anyone gone through this that can offer me some advice.    thanks:)

2050,my 8 yr old son has had three accidents at school. two of them were bowel movements and today he urinated in his pants. all of them have occured within the last 4 school days. he has never had a problem at all like this. i am very concerned about him as well as the school. i'm going to take him to see our family doctor but would like to hear any ideas on why this is happening.
2051,my child has always been an awful sleeper.    always waking up at night.    i have tried anything that anyone has ever suggested. even tried a major bribe (buying her a cat if she stayed in bed for 3 months). that worked for about 6 months. eventually, she started getting out of bed again....anywhere from one to six times a night. so, i kept threatening to take her cat away. i followed through.    took her cat to stay with grandma until my daughter stayed in bed again. life was good!now, here we are 6 months later. now, she wont go to sleep.    takes her hours, and repeated trips back to her room.    i have tried comfort talk, consequences, and even resorted to spanks.    nothing works.i dont understand this.    her bedtime routine is consistant.i honestly feel like im ready to run! i cant take this anymore.    i wouldve thought that by the age of 6, she'd finally just sleep well.what can i/we do????
2052,i was just sitting here fuming again because i saw a replay of the mccain/obama debate from before the election.    the one when mccain said these people are expecting the government to pay for transplants and such, these are cosmetic elective surgeries.    i know the election is over, but i just was wondering if anybody else caught that.    thank god he was not elected.
2053,my wife and i have been raising out 4 yr old grand daughter since sept 2008. she was 2 yrs old at the time. in april 2009 she was dianosed with ostrea sarcome(bone cancer). we were devestated, and we were really torn with deseasons that we were having to make almost immediately. she treatement plan was to go through chemo for 34 weeks, and have her left leg amputated in 10 weeks. my wife kept working throught all of this and i was the care taker who would spend 5 - 6 days and nights at the hospital. my wife would come at the evenings and spend the weekend threre. during all of this, i was taught to do things that the nurses were trained to do. things that were paingful to our grand daughter. but i did them reguardless, because it was the right thing to do. our granddaughter hated me for this. verballly and physically. most of the time she would tell me to leave and that i was mean. over time it really got to me that i just wasnted to quite. but i love her and could not stop. we have been home now since january. she still continues to see me as the bad guy. most other times she loves me and loves to play with me. still i want to run and give up. the real problems is that my wife is the opposite. she allows her to do things that i say no too. this makes our grand daughter see me as what he says doesn't matter. grandma will give me that. i'm mad at both grandma and granddaughter. i've read that younger children will do things because they don't understand. that we are supposted to respond with a positive answer, and explain to them why we are doing it. but the hurt and angry that she throws at me really hurts. i feel like i've stopped my life to take care of her and she owes me. that really sounds bad, but that's how i feel. don't get me wrong, i would do it all over again if i had to. i love her to pieces and if god or whoever could give me her issues, i would take them in a minute. she is too young to have to go through what she is going through.i'm very tired. we spend 5 days a week driving 30 minutes each way to doctors appt. usually 1 to 2 hours at the appointment. then 30 min back. not to include getting her dressed and breakfest. then i take her to school, then i go to work and work 8 hours. there is not enough hours in a day, and not enought days in a week. i'm very tired.i'm just complaining. looking for someone out there with simular issues, and maybe some suggestions on how i can handle life alittle betterthanks for listening.
2054,my 5 year old son has been getting sad faces every day in kindergarten.    there are always multiple comments from his teacher, mostly with regard to not working when others are working, talking in the bathroom, crawling around on the floor, and not walking nicely in line.    he can be very obstinant at home. it seems as everything is met with defiance (i don't want to....). he tends to grunt or stomp when asked to do something.    even though he has learned his sight words and performs well academically, he always voices that he doesn't want to learn...that he would rather play.    he can read all of his sight words but will read with an exasperated voice.    all he wants to do is play!    as with many other 5 year old boys, he is very self centered, does not like to share, hates to lose at anything.    he has a 2 year old brother and they are typical in terms of getting along one minute and fighting the next. i feel like he has changed since his brother was born.    his brother is almost 3 now! should we not be seeing some changes.    my husband and i take away privileges, spank when deemed appropriate, and send him to his room for time outs.    we set up a reward system and that worked for about 2 weeks but he returned to acting out behavior in school.    when in preschool his last year before kindergarted he often got reports of being disobedient by the teachers (this was a christian academy).    when asked why he acts out he will often reply, because i wantede to or i thought about it doing it and i did it. i am at my wit's end.    naturally, my thoughts go to add or oppositional defiant disorder.    i feel guilty because i am beginning to dislike my child.    please help!
2055,i have a son who is 3 (brady).    my niece has a son who is also 3 (kevin).    everytime we go over to my mother in laws house (every sunday) my niece's son hits my son.    kevin hits him with objects (plastic golf clubs, plastic bats) and he leaves bruises on him.    about 3 weeks ago, kevin hit him with a plastic bat (at our house) and left a bruise on his shoulder.    yesterday he hit brady with a plastic golf club in the ribs and there is a bruise about the size of a half dollar.    my neice has put kevin in time out (she doesn't believe in spanking) but he smiles about it.    she says that he only hits brady and none of his other friends but he has also hit my 6 year old.    i don't know what to do!    i can't allow for my son to be abused by his cousin.    any adivce??
2056,my 8 yr old daughter's belly button is infected in some way.    it has mucus around and she's not sick or anything, so i am just concerned where this is coming from? could you please help me.
2057,i am worried that my 7 year old daughter is showing signs of anti social behaviour. after 3 years at school she has not made any (close) friends and rarely gets invited for play dates. i am working mum so after school she is taken care off by a nanny (who also takes care of our younger daughter who is 2.5). my nanny tells me that at play dates in my house she is bossy and expects her guest to play only games she ( = my daughter) wants to play. in general, if things don't go her way she can get quite rude and unpleasant. this year she has had some problems with her social skills at school as well - the school told me that she plays rough and she was also mean to some of the younger kids. after me working closely with school and monitoring her behaviour - these incidents stopped for 6 moths or so but then started again couple of weeks ago. i cannot think of any real reason why she would start to play up again. academically she is very strong and has had highest marks in her first exams.it is important to note that she was only child for 5 years and is still quite jealous of her younger sister. i have also noticed that she has started to lie in order to get herself out of trouble.yesterday she went for a play date at the house of one of the boys from her school - they had play dates before at my house and my nanny told me that they don't get on particularly well as they seem to be too much of the same behaviour. anyway - the afternoon was hell!!!. his poor mother was so stressed and tired by the end of it that i felt a need to write her a long e-mail apologising for everything. this mother told me that my daughter was apparently really bossy, attention seeking, lying and even used f word (not sure where does it come from!)...all in all - at her worst behaviour.i had a long talk with her last night but have doubts that it will make much difference.how do i get though to her as i am worried that if she continues like this she will be labelled for her poor social skills?ambk
2058,hi i have 2 year old(birthday in april) triplets. one of the triplets is very hyper and active and loud. she also does a strange thing with her diaper and other cotton like items. it started about 4 or 5 months ago with blankets. she picks at the blanket until she gets a bit of the cotton off and then drags the cotton across her lips for a minute or so and then tosses the cotton. now she is doing it with parts of the outside of her diaper. she gets a pretty good amount of cotton off the side stretchy part of the diapers and drags them across her lips and then throws them in her hair. she has 2 to 3 bunches of cotton in her hair at any time. i try and correct her about not doing this action but by the end of the day there are 100 bunches of cotton all over the rug. we try to keep her dressed, but she takes off her clothes, or she'd just find a blanket and use that for the little bits of cotton. like i said she is very active and probably gets more time outs than her triplet sisters but i am concerned with this behavior is a bit odd.
2059,my 7 year old recently made a comment to his neighbors (boys) suggesting that they pull the underwear down of another 4 yr old girl neighbor and to spank her bottom. then soon after this comment was made, he was at her home and the girls mother found him in her closet with his pants down, alone. she told me that her daughter told her that my son pulls her in bushes. i have also been told that he explained to other children that the way you have sex is to be naked and to lay on top of one another and to kiss.i am very concerned. i know that we have caught him watching inapropriate sexual scenes on cable tv that we immediately blocked. he has also experimented with typing on the internet search words such as butt or boobs, etc. i am so embaressed and scared. i worry that what he is doing is a problem and i do not know how to erase the thoughts from his mind. i also am worried about how his self esteem will be effected by the fact that my neighbors have told him he is not allowed to play with their children or come in their yard or home. i almost want to move away. what can i do to help him correct this issue and help him with the rejection he is getting as a result of his behavior?
2060,my 6 year old daughter started shaking her head about a month ago, like she was getting the hair out of her eyes.    we took her to get a haircut but that didn't stop the shaking.    she says that she knows she is doing it but can't help it and i believe her as she still does it right before sleep as well.    she also has a little hum that goes along with it.    when asked if something is bothering her, she says that she misses me now that school has started but school is not new to her as she is in first grade.    what could this be?     we started her on amoxicillin because one doctor told us that it could be due to an untreated strep infection.    she has only been on the medication for a couple of days so we're waiting to see if it helps.    any ideas?
2061,my son, turning 7 in feb., has angry, know-it-all, respect issues. he is a loving, sweet boy at heart but when he doesn't get his way or is disciplined, he panics and then he gets so angry!when he learns about a new topic (school, sports, games, anything), he thinks he's an    expert immediately, becomes belligerent, and doesn't want to be taught anymore about it. he talks in class so he misses instructions and blames other kids for distracting him. he talks over top of us, does not want to wait his turn to talk, yells to make his point and is convinced he is right about things he has little knowledge.i've seen so many children that take the word of their parents as the word of god! not mine.he always knows better and second guesses what adults tell him. he lays blame on others and seems to think that when things don't go his way, or if he's disciplined, it is someone else's fault (ie: well if you wouldn't have done..., i wouldn't have to act like... or i'm being mean because you won't let me...). it just won't blow over and he over reacts drastically even if it's just a matter of brushing his teeth, or turning the tv off to practice his reading or do some other activity.even when he was 8mos. old, if we stopped him from doing something he wanted to do (ie: climbing things, playing w/ things he shouldn't), he would just freak out.he's very smart, good at math, loving, and he even says that he wants to behave. he confesses to me that it is very difficult for him not to react the ways he does.can anyone help???
2062,first i want to say hi to you all,iam from canada (eastern nb)and iam soo glad i found this place!!ok i turned 40 yrs old in sept (gulp) always had severe periods everymonth,went to the dr only to find out that i had a 10x9x6 cyst on my left ovary, somy dr referred me to a specialist,and also recommended a complete hysterectomy at the same time! went to the specialist in october /09 and had my hysterectomy on december 14th /09 and yes that is fast for here lol.i had a c-section in 1988 so he said he would go through the same scar as my c-section so it is straight up and down.he said surgery went well.i was in the hospital for 4 days.had no vaginal discharge at all,which i thought was awesome as i was on my period when i went in.lots of discomfort and pain due to sugery but that is normal and i think of myself as pretty tough lol.or so i thought.........saturday dec 19th my incision started to bleed some,it was a little red blood so i was concerned and went to the clinic.they said it was fine it was a pocket they gave me some belly pads to bring home.sunday dec 20th through the whole day i filled 6 of those belly pads to me this was to much,so i called tele-care,they said watch it through the night if continues go to the hospital,it slowed down alot by morning,december 23rd ten days later i go to the local health center where my own family dr was on duty at the time (thank god)to have my 26 staples removed low and behold as they are taking the last staple out pop goes the incision,by this time i am scared (so much for the tough girl) the nurse is saying well maybe we can tape it with steri strips..at the same time looking like she is not sure,my dr came in and is like no it needs to be packed!so here it is january 13th i still have a hole in my belly,the nusre is still coming to pack it,and i can feel it bleeding al the time.my question is how long does an open incision healing from the inside out normally take to heal?then tuesday my reg time to start my period.ugg i start bleeding some red blood,so now im just peed off lol.i had a dr app yesterday anyway so i called him and explained what is happening he says ok we will do a urine test in the morning..i get to the dr do the test,and he finds,,,blood in my uring which he is sure just from surgery,said something prob just let go,he finds white blood cells and lots of sugar in my urine as well.so now the nice nurse who comes thursday,not only has to change the dressing but aloso take blood,,,,all i wanna know is ..is this ever gonna get better??my dr also says do nothing for the next 4 weeks which wil be my 8 weeks after surgery, then when the hole is healed do nothing another 4-6 weeks!!is there a chance it can come open again after its healed??wow i feel better maybe i just needed to vent lol.any suggestion or tips would be wonderful..iam so gonna have cabin fever after this is over lolterri
2063,i have a wonderful 4 year old son who is scarily intelligent, he loves doing maths and spelling at home and has been really advanced from an early age with regards to learning.however since starting nursery last september he has struggled with taking turns, he shouts alot,i think from excitement as well as frustration as he is very enthusiastic, he also is very particulat about certain things ie always sitting on the blue chair and when he cant loses it.he has never showed any signs of agression towards anyone but is alienating himself as the other children dont like it when he shouts at them if they disturb him when creating something, he also says things like dont look at me when upset.he has never been a large eater and is also not sleeping well, waking in the night with bad dreams and taking a while to settle even though he is tired and has been up since 6.30am, he refuses to sleep during the day.today when my mum picked him up from nursery he was crying again and saying he didnt like nursery.i dont know what to do, the nursery say that this is common with intelligent boys whose emotional level is not at the same level but he seems so unhappy and it is affecting all of us every day.any suggestions would be great, have never done this before!
2064,my little guy that is going to be 5 in a ouple of days, has a major aditude problem. if i get after him for something, he come right back in a snitty voice and repeats what i say. he also is very hateful towards me, i know he's a daddies boy but there are days i can't even look at him, and others i'm his best friend. we also have problems in the morning getting ready for school, it's like we are walking on eggshells until we know if he wakes up on the right side  of the bed. it's all so confusing, is it normal or do i have something to worry about?
2065,i have tried everything from counseling to medication.    my son is very smart but he uses it to manipulate every situation.    he refuses to take responsibility for his actions.    he has    been diagnosed with adhd and odd.    when he wants to he can behave in school at home but in a snap he refuses.    he breaks thinks and hurts his siblings if he doesnt get his way.    i have have also removed him from his meds and placed him on an organic diet and it works sometimes like everything else but i really believe we have a serious problem.    what else is there?    i am at my wits end i cant afford a fancy school to send him to.    what else can we do.this discussion is related toschool behavioral problems with gifted 8 year old child.
2066,my son is 6 and he is in 1st grade... he has been in trouble 5 times now pinching another boy in the privates.. i am thinking this is for attention.. my son is an only child, he has done preschool, and kindergarten prior to first grade...    i am a stay at home mom...     the school is working with me to make this behavior stop. i am at my wits end, i have treid everything..    hes not doing it in a mean way...i have tried taking away tv, toys, using the reward sticker program.. everything.. i fear he will get kicked out of school..i was up helping at the school today, and he did it! i didnt see it, but his victim came up and told me!    its always the same boy... an he has a sport with him too...please help!
2067,i've been told a couple of times from very tired looking caregivers, that my grandson is basically out of control, much of the time. he doesn't listen, has been mean to the other children, and is always always busy.    i myself have often wondered if he isn't adhd; he is always busy, and can't seem to spend any length of time with one activity.....just goes from one thing to another. and one on one with me, is good, most of the time, but he demands a lot of my attention. he is very sweet, and loves to cuddle, is kind toward the cats and dogs, and even the monster he invented. i do know there is a lot of stress in his life......he adores his daddy, but daddy had to move out and mom then moved in her new boyfriend (to who she married). he will tell me i miss my daddy, and lives to see him again.how much of this is normal behavior? how to deal with it? i love the little guy with my whole heart and soul, and try to take him every other weekend, so that he has some sense of stability. but i would like to be able to do more, because i'm afraid of what lies down the road ahead for him if his behavior continues on this path. does he need therapy??? thanks so much, i'm so worried.
2068,we have 2 children a boy 7 (8 in sept) and a girl 4. both have never had problems sleeping etc but for the last 3 months my 7yr old boy has had real issues. each night at bed time he works himself up into a frenzy saying he is scared of the feeling of falling asleep. we have tried and the usual things. reading, bathtimes, removal of treats , no tv, football bans etc etc and nothing seems to work. he informs us he just cannot help it doesnt know what the matter is. once finallty he does calm down he is asleep in seconds but this can take over an hr of screaming and him being scared. if i am out he constantly asks his mum to phone me and get me to come home. vice versa if she is out he does the same to me but crys for his mum....    please please help someone ...
2069,i can't get my son to stop talking back....he picks and picks.    he will not stop!    it usually starts with homework.    he procrastinates really bad.    he sits at the table for hours.    i disipline him and he just does not stop.    i finally have to leave and count to ten.    how do i get him to just stop talking back?
2070,i have been treated for a bacterial and yeast infection, however it fixed my problem of stinging/burning after sex for a very short period of time. i went in again and they treated me once again for a yeast infection. the second time did take the irritating feeling away however not all together. at first it was just a very slight stinging/burning feeling, however now it's back all together.it only happens after sex. there is no odor, there is no itching, there's nothing but the stinging/burning feeling after sex. please help! i'm going back to the gynecologist if you have any suggestions please let me know i  d greatly appreciate it!
2071,my son is 6 and in kindergarten. he goes to school and won't pee his pants at school but almost right after he comes home from school he pees his pants. he used to when he was younger and then quit but now he is doing it again. i don't know whats wrong. he does wet the bed at night as well. he usually will only do it once a day but it is only when he is home.    never at school. i have asked him if he feels that he needs to go because if i am around when he does it he will usually be doing the pee pee dance right before but he won't go to the potty. he says that he does feel it. i am not sure what to do.

2075,my 5 yr. old son is so afraid to go to school, he started kindergarten this year. he went the first two days and seemed ok. i did notice strange behaviors like body stiffness and not wanting to talk about his day, upon picking him up from school. then he started to mention feelings of fear and embarrassment. he said he can't talk at school and his voice changed as he told me this. he mentioned getting hot and shaking. the teacher told me on his third day he cried a lot and he wouldn't participate unless she gave him one on one attention and a lot of reassurance. he claims everything is to hard and the day way to long. he really don't like lunch time either. every time school is even mentioned he immediately turns red faced his voice gets low and squeaky and he says he's sleepy and goes to lay in his bed, also wants to be alone. he went thru preschool pretty well. the first time he had an anxiety attack was at a new daycare, one that he only went to for about a month and a half. he was ready and excited to start school. he missed a day last week because he was freaking out so bad, i just couldn't force him to go. it breaks my heart to see him so scared. he just began counseling and is scheduled to see a dr. soon for not being able to sleep and uncontrollable behaviors. the anxiety wasn't there since he hadn't gone to that daycare, school brought it back.
2076,my 3 yearold is a loving hugging wee boy is clever and creative can count to 20 and knows all the letters of the alpahbet he tells me he loves me very much and is a happy wee soul most of the time but as soon as things dont go his way or i tell him i dont want him doing that or i tell him no he cant have another something or other thats he's wanting he flies off the handle throws whatever is near him sometimes at me or his dad he hits kicks flaps his arms around in a fit of rage when i try to restrain him he dos not listen to reason or alow his dad to try calm him down he directs all his anger out on things around him throws his toys and today he lifted a fire log just a small one and aimed at he i have tried not to lose my temper and always put him on the third stair until he shows he is calm and sorry but today i was so stressed by his outbursts of behaviour that i took my hand and gave him 2 spanks on the bum i just dont know if he will ever stop this agressive behaviour and i worry as he is starting pre-school in 6 weeks. sometimes this is making         me and my husban fall out and he can hear us shouting its all just too stressful and i feel im going to fall apart

2079,can anyone help me teach my 3 year old how to say thank you? mom & i have stressed saying thanks for the little things - e.g. when she gets a treat - and she has no real problem with that.but at times she won't say thank you for gifts. she understands what to say and who to say it to, but she is just refusing. we had a guest here the other day who brought her a new doll. we asked our girl to say thanks but she wouldn't. we've refused to take the doll out of it's package until she will say thanks & she's still not budging. now we've told her we're going to give the doll to another child who needs a toy (toys for tots) if she won't say thank you. she doesn't want us to give the doll away, but she seems content to leave it in it's package. this whole thing started 3 days ago, but we've had similar problems in the past several months.some say it's just a phase, and i agree it is. but that doesn't make it okay. she's clear on what to say & why she needs to say it.help!! (& thanks in advance to anyone who shares advice)
2080,guys, the 12 year old girl who was trolling around the child behavior forum is back. she has been mainly posting in the maternal/child forum. she makes up stories to get people's sympathy and when she gets found out, she disappears for awhile only to show up again under a different username. so far we know she's used at least 4 different usernames. they aredogluver123212rkbkmommyof10and the latest is #5onthewayyou might recognize that she wrote a post here about her 12 year old needing glasses. she's the 12 year old! she also made up a big story on the maternal forum about her 23 year old son falling downstairs and becoming paralized. she had us going for a day or two but her story kept getting more bizarre. you can read it at the maternal forum titled prayers needed.i'm just letting everyone know because she keeps coming back using a different username. i want everyone to be aware and watchful. she's actually given out dangerous advice. laura1977 warned everyone about her too back on page 5 on this forum.i actually feel kinda sorry for this kid. she keeps mentioning her brother's death. maybe something really did happen and she doesn't know how to deal with it. i don't know. like i wrote to the others on the maternal forum, i just wish she didn't feel the need to make up stories. if she's needing someone to talk to, she could always go to the depression or teen forum or something. it's sad because her actions are just making things worse for her.who knows, though, maybe this time she'll leave knowing we all are watching for her.anyway, i just wanted to let you all know so we can be watchful and aware.take care, everyone.
2081,i am definitley having my lap band removed in 10 days.    my dr. said it could stay in and never bother me after i had it emptied today but i thought why have this in me if it is not doing anything.    i am very relieved to be doing this and have a great doctor that will perform the surgery.    it is interesting in that all of my friends seem very relieved that i am taking the lap band out.    .    i did not have any problems per say with the band, just acid reflux and no weight loss in 2 years which was partly my fault.    i fluxuated between a 4-6 lb. weight loss over 2 years.    has anyone had this done for the same reasons and were there complications after the surgery?
2082,my son is 4 and having a very hard time at daycare.    he recently got a new teacher and is not adjusting to her yet.    it has been about a month and he has gotten very oppositional at school.    he has his moments at home too, but does not act like this all the time.    he gets frustrated and upset very easy, has started spitting, and is hitting his peers and teacher.    i don't know what to do, but the new teacher is worried about him liking her and i feel she is not consistent with discipline.    i also thought he was in pre-k, but they just told me he is in preschool because they don't think he will be ready for kindergarten next year because he can't stay focused.    i don't know if it's just not structured enough or if he is bored, because he seems to be pretty smart.    he is also telling me all the time that he wants a new school but will not specify why.    should i have him see a professional, change schools, consider a nanny?    please help, i am almost at my whits end

2087,our son is almost 6 years old. he stopped peeing in bed when he was little. we are wondering if something is not right. he sometimes poops or pee on himself especially if he is somewhere playing(playground) or watching a tv show he likes or plaing video games. it does not happen all the time. he might stay with no problems for weeks then when it comes back he does it over and over again. most of the time is just a smear on his underwear. we have been forced to throw a lot of his underwears. he claims he does not know when its coming out although we doubt that. he does not pee or poop in bed. he crys when we ask him if he thinks he need to wear diapers. he is a very very active boy and plays a lot.is he just lazy or don`t want to stop what he is doing to us the restroom? is this normal or we need to get him some help? please help.
2088,i am at the end of my rope with my daughter. she is six years old and in the first grade. she is described (by teachers, doctors, etc) as a bright, sweet girl but . . .she is prone to these temper tantrum/rages. if she doesn't get what she wants, if she hears a no, if she has to wait on something, if she gets frustrated, if she is not the center of attention the water works start. the tears and crying are mild in comparison to the angry, escalating reactions. for example, when the teacher did not call on her, she got upset, kicked her desk, pushed it away, yelled out, screamed and cried and eventually hurt herself by flailing before the teacher could get to her and get her out of the classroom.another time, she was in cool down in the hallway because she was already upset and crying and she got angry and threw her eyeglasses and stomped her feet.at home, she will throw toys, clothes, stomp feet, beat the walls and scream that i hate you, to her father and i.since school has started, she has been taken out of class and put in cool out in the principal's office three times. school has been in session for three weeks, and the three visits to cool out were within a span of five days.she is told the rules before hand, and when she breaks them, it is explained what she did wrong and she acknowledges it. (i yelled at daddy. that wasn't nice.) however, when she is punished (sent to bed, privileges revoked) she will instantly not accept the blame. instead it becomes my fault, my husband's fault, the teacher's fault, anyone's fault but hers. and we are doing it not because she did something wrong, but because you're mean and you don't love me.these attacks are not infrequent. they happen regularly at least every other day. my husband and i don't know what to do. we recently moved and she started a new school, but she had these problems before the move and school change, however, so i don't believe that is all of her problem.are there any suggestions to help us? we have an appointment scheduled for a psychologist but that's two weeks out. could there be something medical that i could ask her family physician to look at? am i missing anything or are there other details and information i should be gathering to give to her psychologist when we go?
2089,my son is 11, almost 12, and he always has a bad temper, always frustrated with everything. he is controlling towards me, and he won't take no for an answer. i am a single mother, and i feel overwhelmed all the time with his behaviour. at school he is quiet, the contrary of what he is at home. don't know what to do with him.he wants things always done his way. he just wants to play, and won't concentrate on important things.he also gets violent.what should i do?

2091,i hope someone can send me in the right direction or help.    my daughter just turned 2.    i have taken her to all her normal doctors check-ups with only one concern over the 2 years and that was that she never slept through the night.    we have kept a close eye on her progression because her sister is on the autism spectrum.    she is hitting all milestones and seems to be pretty on track with everything other than her behavior.    we brought her to the pediatrician because she was having screaming fits since about a year old.    she doesn't seem to have the normal temper tantrums and eventually calm down-this goes on for hours, and happens about 3-6 times a day.    i know she is two, but everyone who sees her behavior thinks this is not normal.    i don't know what to do, the doctor seems to think there is nothing wrong with her.    is this normal???    i am ready to pull my hair out because i do not know if there is something wrong and i should be helping or if she is just one of those kids and i have my hands full with behavior.    if anyone can suggest what i should do next or where to turn to, i would greatly appreciate it.
2092,i hurt for my teenage son.    he is 17 years old and he will tell you i know i'm not an average guy.    for his entire academic and social life, my son has been troubled with bullies and lacking in true friends.    my son has been diagnosed with high functioning asperser  s a few year ago with the most evident symptom being his lack of appropriate social skills.    his lack of social skills easily has made him a target as other children see him as odd and annoying.    he has always had to eat lunch alone and has often been made to move from a table by other kids.    no one ever calls or asks him to come over.    it breaks my heart for him.    i've intervened on many specific occasions of bullying with the school's support, but these interventions have not nor ever could totally shelter my son from his loneliness.    the cumulative result of all the years came to a head last spring.    with the stress of school (he does have an iep) and the obvious daily battle of enduring another day of loneliness....he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.    he began to journal his feelings (very healthy i think); however he began having conversations about his feelings with imaginary friends in his journal.    when asked by our physician, our son informs us that he knows they are imaginary.    over the summer, our son discovered the internet and forums.    although his opinions often open him up for cyber bullying, he has found some friends online.    he began to want to dress in all black clothes and refuses to wear anything else.    he told us prior to the beginning of this school year, that if they don't get me, they don't get me!    i guess this is a healthy attitude to have, but it breaks my heart.    all his teachers say he is doing fantastic this year, but i can't tell you how sad i am for him. he said the other day that he feels like he has to hang around the goths despite disagreeing with them on some moral issues, because, if i reject them, i'll have no one.    bless his heart.    he says he still has his imaginary friends and even draws pictures of them.    his doctor tells me that he is just being creative...but it does concern me.    i believe that he is so lonely that he has had to create his own circle of friends...even if they don't really exist.    this grieves me so much!    how can i help?    i'm his mother and we are very close...thank goodness.    he is going away to a very small community college next fall........i pray he finds a least one other person that accepts him and does not judge him for being a little different. he is a good boy!    never gets in trouble at school!!    someone told me that college may be different for my son.....as the trivial high school antics are not so easily accepted or tolerated....i pray this is true.    he has a strong christian faith.......i'm so glad he has his faith.    please help us, help our son......to feel worthy, to feel an important part of this planet!    how can i help prepare him for college!    guidance please!!mom to a lonely boy!
2093,our daughter is 10 years old.    she has adhd and also been diagnosed with odd.    she has been taking medication for adhd since 1st grade and is now in 5th.    she has always been very strong willed and tends to not go with the flow, either with parents or friends. this year has been evolving to a place that is too much for the household to sustain.we have tried many different behavioral techniques to try to work through things but to no avail.    her hatered for school, her family, her tennis lessons....etc is off the charts.    she says the most hurtful and mean things one human can say to another when she is being presented with something that she does not want to do.    we used to get mad back and fly off the handle and lately we have tried staying as calm as possible and give her choices that she can make....actually seems to be getting worse though.it is breaking our hearts that our little girl has turned on us at 10 years old for no apparent reason.i will add that when she is playing with her friends she is happy as can be.    she lives for that.    she will be all smiles and happy with all of us if she can have a friend with her.    anything that cuts into that play time, she hates with a vengence.this discussion is related tohateful daughter.
2094,i have a five year old boy. when he was younger we had an incident and reported it to the police. he was 2.5 years old when his uncle, who was 8 at the time and was sexual abuse by his mother, was touching and looking at each others privates. i called the police and hold a lot of resentment about the situation. everyone around me said it was normal child behavior, but i worried it was more. the uncle was badly abused and at the time had the mental capacity of a 5 or 6 year old from the abuse. now my son is 5 and is showing what i think are signs of the abuse and everyone around me is again telling me boys will be boys. he as now gotten to where he is pulling his pants down in a room with 3 other kids his age. i am worrying that i missed some signs by listening to everyone around me. i really hope i did not fail my son, but besides these behavior problems he seems to be a happy little boy. he says he does not want to go to school about every other day. he plays well with other children and is my only child. he loves attention, but believes he is getting to big to give his mom hugs and kisses. should i worry or should i relax and let kids be kids?
2095,i start clomid 50mg today day 3 of cycle.    i get so confused by all this.    i know that i should get the opk's but the question is when should we have sex.    should we not have sex until the opk is positive? any help is greatly appreciated.
2096,has anyone had any good experience using this food.i just started this week and i actually feel stronger in my weight training,or is this all in my head.from my resarch on it it looks like a miracle food.
2097,my 5 yr old boy has been diagnosed with adhd, and pdd. i have no idea if these diagnoseses are correct, but my son seems to be sadistic. every minute of every day, he is so mean to me and his sister. his baby sister and i have to lock ourselves in a room at times because he is spitting and kicking. he thinks it is funny to hurt us. this isn't new. he has been this way since he learned how to talk. he is very emotionally disturbed, i know. but this behavior only is with me and others he lives with. i have tried to sit with him and give him more and more attention. he, out of the blue, kicks his baby sister in the head and laughs. he has a therapist, a docter, and med reviews. he is on resperdal, which doesn't make it any better. he has tried other meds that make it worst, or don't work. his psychologist says he has anger issues with me. i don't know why. these behaviors aren't when he is mad. they come out of nowhere. i am scared of him. today, he thought he would wake me up by sitting on a pillow on top of my face. i don't let him watch scary movies, i am a stay at home mom. is he truely sadistic? he says he is going to pee on me. he won't go to his rm when i tell him time-out time. we used pecs pictures because of verbal delays. but i seem to think he is just thinking it is fun to be meant to us, no matter what. please, help. he is too young to go into a hospital for treatment, but he is a danger to himself and others.
2098,i was wondering if you could assist me or lead me to someone who can?    i'm searching for a case in which to carry my ostomy supplies.    the one i have now is pretty old and will need to be replaced.    unfortunately, the only id that's on it is made in china.    it's a vinyl case 8 long x7 wide & 4 deep.     when you unzip it,it opens up to reveal 3 sections with pockets to put supplies.    it also has a zippered pocket and a regular pocket on the outside. also, on the outside, there is a large hook on one end and a handle on the other.    i can't believe they don't still make something comparable to this for ostomates who travel, etc.    so far, i've had no luck finding it or something comparable.    hope someone out there can help.
2099,my daughter is going to be two in november. she has developed a habit of wanting to be in her room. she has a tv, vcr, movie, toys, and is allowed to do anything she wants in there without punishment (prettymuch).    she will offten come out to play or see what everyones doing stay out for 40 min or so and go back to her room for about an hour. she also goes to her room if she doesn't get what she wants, or gets in trouble told no ect.. we have her on a schedule where she gets up, naps, and goes to bed which she handles fine. however, she really does spend a lot of time in her room. my mom is driving me nuts telling me there's something wrong, and i'm not around all day long so i dont see it (i have school and work full time). is my daughter starting an antisocial habit i should worry about or just getting comfortable with having her on space to be free in?
2100,hello ,i have put my son for karate classes . i find all the time practising his steps on family members . he also does the steps when he is lonely. will this not effect his mind ?i am worried?is he ok?
2101,my kid who just turned 3 in march can count to 20, knows alphabets, shapes, colors and is very interested in books. he asks to go friends house but when they come he very very little peer interaction. its the same thing in school. we did access him and they told they don't think of any problem. he talks a lot at home to me and his dad. he understands everything we say and he asks for things. so is this no peer interaction an issue? note english is his second language and he has been staying home full time till 7 months back, then he started going to preschool. he has no behavioral issues. he is a very gentle, soft kid. but just little peer interaction
2102,my daughter has always had a problem wetting her pants.    i've had all the test run and there is nothing medical going on.    with in the last year i've gotten it under control at home but she still seems to be wetting her pants at her fathers every other weekend.i've told him all the ways to handle it but he won't take my advise, he chooses to punish her.    she was at her fathers last weekend and he didn't take her to dance class because he said she pissed her pants and then lied to him about it.    she stayed the night with her step-mothers mom and had an accident over there while sleeping and her father made her aplogize to the grandmother for peeing on her couch.... i'm at a loss on what to do and almost to the point of not letting her go over there any longer...just wondering if there was anything else i could try before resorting to that because when she comes home from her fathers house she always seems so defeated and down on herself which isn't healthy
2103,my family needs help. my grandfather had a stroke 6 weeks ago. it was not massive and the doctors thought we a few weeks of rehab he would be able to go home. they moved him to a reahab place. he has trouble with his left side but knows us all and talks to us. they had some trouble with blood pressure and heart rate but reworked his meds and that is all fine. but he completely refusses to eat at all, and won't rehab. he is very mean at times. he complains that everything taste terrible even water. he says he feels like he is going to through up, but he never has. he has lost 30 lbs in 5 weeks. we don't knwo what to do. every 5 days or so he will have a good day and eat somthing and we are encourged then the next day nothing...we tried everything we know. has anyone else delt with this?? how can we get him to start eating or trying to get better?
2104,my 2 youngest children are 12 (boy) and 14(girl). i used to share custody with my ex,    but my kids would call me all the time needing basic comforting that their father refused to provide. i would even read them books over the phone to help them fall to sleep. when they wouldcome to my house,my daughter would often sleep with me, needing the comfort and i figured she would outgrow it when she was ready, and she did,one year ago. recently, my ex's physical and emotional abuse of my children got out of hand, and long story short, i now have primary custody. during these last 4 months of emotional upheaval, my 12 year old son wants to sleep with me all the time. it's a king sized bed, and there is certainly nothing innapropriate going on. i've asked him why he wants to always sleep in my bed, and he says because it feels so comfortable. ( his father punched him in the ribs repeatedly and told him he was nothing but a lazy fat slob.) i'm thinking he will outgrow this, as his sister did, but am i doing something wrong; am i hurting him somehow?
2105,i have shingles right now, i'm scheduled to have surgery the 27th of this month, will i be okay with surgery if i take the valtrex up to the day of surgery?

2107,can you please help me with my one month old daughter, she cries all the time, i changed the formula i have to see if that helps but it did not, she seems to be constipated, she does not make poop everyday sometimes 3 days goes by and nothing, so i am thinking its either colic or maybe its because she can't go, my doctor just has me changing formulas and i tried giving her some water but nothing seems to work, can someone out there please help me.razthis discussion is related tocollic.
2108,my four year old has enlarged lymph nodes and is acting completely out of control (screaming, being rude to strangers, saying she hates everyone, etc).    the doctor can find nothing wrong with her other than the enlarged lymph nodes (in her neck).    he says it is probably some kind of virus.    she occasionally complains of ear aches but then will say they do not hurt anymore.    can her behavior be linked to the lymph nodes?
2109,our 5-year-old child has some ocd components, and she has recently started digging large holes in the sheetrock of her walls while going to sleep at naptime or bedtime. anyone had any experience managing this behavior?

2111,my child is soon to be 9. when she was 4-5 she was touched inappropriatly by a 14 year old boy. never penetration but he had her look at porn and she was touched.    i didn't find out about this until 2-3 years later and immediately took her to counseling. she saw 2 different counselors and both of them told me after a few sessions that she was doing great and counseling really wasn't needed.now she is obsessed with talking to me about crazy stuff. every night. for 2 -3 hours at a time. she cries and talks incoherantly. i can't understand half of what is coming out of her mouth.    she says she doesn't know if things really happened or if she is making it all up in her mind because things pop in her mind and she can't tell the difference between reality and imagination.today's melt down started with  mom, who wears condoms, boys or girls and then followed with  i may have tried a ciggarette once i told her not to do that again because she is too young and it isn't a good thing to do. that followed with crazy crying and being inconsolable. she then changed the story from ciggarettes to maybe marijuana. when i asked her what the thing looked like that she thought she tried and i clearly told her she wasn't in trouble , i just wanted to know. she then said  she didn't know because she doesn't know if it really happened or notshe constantly asks me about penises and vagina's. she constantly talks to me about sex. kids are picking on her now because of the strange way she behaves. she makes up stories. she is a complete tattle tale and now has little to no friends.i do not know what is wrong with her or where to go . i am so stressed out that i can't take it anymore. i don't want to give up on her. she is my first born, but i can't take it anymore. it's everyday. hours everyday.no matter what i say or do...what i try, it never gets better. never. i have another child too, as a single parent i am at my witts end.do you think she has a mental problem? because i think something is seriously wrong and i don't know how to help her anymore.this is draining and it's tearing my family apart.
2112,i am 24. is it healthy for me to be taking ghreleasers? i am currently on androderm 5mg/daily patches for low testosterone. i just want to know if there would be any negative side affects from me taking natural ghr. this is not a question about hgh. i am not interested in taking synthetic hgh. i would like some recommendations on brands and types of ghr that would work for me, a 24 year old healthy male.thanks!
2113,my grandson is 6, he's been on adderall(adderrall)and now ritalin, since he was 3.    he throws things, has temper tantrums, hits, fights, kicks, bites, wipes feces on the wall, starts fires, steals, lies, does not listen at all. he writes on the walls, jumps up and down on our vehicles, has thrown his psp so it doesnt work, torn up his playstation 2, and anything else he's ever been given.    he blames everything on his 4 yr old sister.    he has no friends at school or anywhere.    he is in first grade and makes f in behavior every day.    he still sucks his thumb.    his mom was on crack until she found out she was pregnant, which was end of 3rd month.    his parents spank him constantly.    they are always screaming and beating him for something, which he does do a lot of terrible things.    they have rewarded him for good behavior but that is very rare.    no one can stand to be around him. he won't listen to anyone and i tell his parents not to spank, they have made him this aggressive over the last four years with all these spankings, but they say that is not true, if they don't spank him, he is even worse they say.    i am so worried about him.    his 4 year old sister says she wants to die, does some bad behaviors, and beats her head against the wall any time she is told no or is in trouble. she needs help too.    psychiatrist said my grandson has adhd, (he has been seeing one since he was 3), the school tested him and said he has severe emotional problems and mood disorder.    my granddaughter has never been seen by psychiatrist.    i don't know what to do, they tell me to stay out of it, but my heart just can't take my grandkids having so many problems.    help me please someone!!!!!!!
2114,my son has some behavioral issues and we are seeking help through a psychologist.    we recently met with a doctor.    he told us that he would like to have permission to keep our son's secrets from us, even though by law we are entitled to know everything our son tells him.    we have never had any counseling experience, so i wanted to know if this is a normal request.    i am not comfortable with this.    i do not think it is prudent to give permission to another adult to keep secrets from a parent, nor do i want to set the precedent with my son to do this.thank you.
2115,i am at wits end with my 8 year old son who has anger issues and after a period of seeming better now seems worse.he has clothes issues and will only wear certain clothes .... getting him to shower/wash his hair is also another issue i am waiting for my family doctor to send him for testing but yet it takes so long to get an appointment. what can i do in the interim,    any discplinary action names me as a 'mean mum' it seems to be his way or no way, now winter is setting in i have coat and boot issues to contend with and finding it more and more trying. taking him to choose his own clothes i thought would be a solution yet still seems to prove not a solution! i was hoping he would grow out of it by now?? but now worried there is a chemical in balance hense my going to the family doctor who seems in no rush to have him tested, we are awaiting an appointment for a pediatric psychiatrist how long should i wait before seeking another opinion, emotionally it is draining and what energy i have ( i have lots ) i find it is disrupting the whole family. his eating is poor and probably part of his condition and adding to home challenges, at school he is doing fine so adhd does not seem to be issue ( well that i know of ) anyone with any advise would be greatly appreciated, what to do next?worried mum
2116,i have a 10 yr old and he is that aggressive towards his brother and his sister. he hurts them untill he sees blood recently he split his 8yr old brothers head open. his 6yr old sister gets strangled by him. he started a riet at his old school so i had to move him schools. he says some nasty things to me that make me cry. he was put on ritalin and catapress but doesnt last for long.my child is at that stage where has no friends i just need to know what i should do to controll him cause i love my son very much
2117,my 7 year old son just started thinking my wife and or i will leave him. if we drop him off at sunday school he doesn't want to go because he thinks we'll not pick him up. his aunt and nephew asked him to go shopping and buy a toy which typically he would love but did not want to leave mom and dad. my wife and i went to diner and grandpa watched him which had been done several times before with no issue has now turned into him crying and not wanting us to leave and wanting to know when we'll be back. how can i reassure him and fix this? he turns on the tears not a grab leg type of worry just crying.    we have tried to reassure him this would never happen.
2118,my 3 1/2 yo son has been day trained for neary 2 years but cant do the night whitch i dont mind so much, but im doing my head in about the days. he wets his pants on average 3 times a day,some days not at all, this has been going on for the last 4 months. we have tried rewards if he is good, taking toys away, treats, naughty corner, put to bed. nothing is working with him, have had him to the doctor i dont know how many times they say there is nothing wrong with him. what else can i do ?????
2119,my 4 yr old son got kicked out of his daycare about 2 weeks ago for bad behavior.    they just plain gave up on helping us.    now he is in a new one in the next town because we only had one in the small town we live in.    he's had a hard time adjusting to the new one.    i talked to his teacher when he started and told her everything that went on at the other one so they would know what is going on.    he would have a tantrum and then throw chairs or toys and time out never worked.    now at the new one he would do really good for about 3 days and then have a bad day to where he would pitch a fit which lead to throwing chairs, etc.    he been there for 12 days and has had 3 bad days.    he had a bad day friday and now they don't know if he's allowed back on monday.    i have talked to our pediatrician several times about his behavior and i finally asked her to recommend an adolescent counselor which we are going to this week.    he only acts like this at school and not at home.    i don't know why he thinks he can get away with it there, we talk to him all the time about listening to his teachers and doing what they ask him to do.    it seems that they are giving up on us too.    we are doing our best to try and help our son but we can't find a daycare who is willing to work with us.    he starts prek next year and we don't want this behavior there too.

2122,im a mum with 4 children i have a 8 year old girl she is really naughty she lies,horrible to others tantrums, swears. i have tried everything but nothing seems to work i know what i need is help what do i do.
2123,hi there,my 27 month old son is happy, out-going, social and very active who sleeps well, can be a little fussy with food, and has tantrums maybe once a day on average -- so nothing out of the ordinary, i believe. i am at home full time with him and his 8 month old brother so he has never been in any kind of day care.my concern is that he shows no interest in sitting down and concentrating on the types of activities i keep reading that other toddlers enjoy, and i wonder whether he is already showing signs of some kind of adhd or attention-related problems. he will not do puzzles, play with blocks, spend much time with shape sorters, or draw or paint, or anything similar. he does like to look at books, and play with cars / planes / trains, but usually not for very long. he tends to cruise continuously and just sample things briefly. he has been seen by an occupational therapist who tried to engage him in activities so she could lengthen his concentration, but he just wanted to run around the room and look at things. she suggested i try to get him to focus on just one toy at a time and sit with him and keep him at a single activity for as long as possible, ideally for at least half an hour a day. i have tried presenting lots of activities to him and this has been tough, especially as i am often forced to get up and leave him to attend to the 8 month old. to keep him at an activity simple persuasion usually doesn't work, only physical restraint which really defeats the purpose.i just try to get out of the house as often as possible to playgroup and the park, but in order to get myself ready to leave i usually put his favourite show on the tv for an hour or so in the morning, and i also use tv at night so i can bath, feed and put the baby to bed without interruption. i am also worried that this is a time bomb waiting to go off, and that i could be worsening any adhd tendencies that he might have for the future.i have bought a few books about toddler activities but am i worrying too much? does his day really have to be filled with structured activities that require my participation the whole time? how can i teach/encourage him to play by himself some of the time?i have started to doubt my ability to provide the right stimulation and have considered day care earlier than i would prefer, although he has severe food allergies and eczema making us nervous about sending him to day care.i'd really appreciate your thoughts.
2124,i delivered my baby girl at 18 weeks.. a week before her delivery everything was fine, i went for a scan and they found so many problems with her it was just not possible for her to survive! she was born on the 20th of december 2009 , she had a hypo-plastic left heart, cyctic hygroma, bright bowel and her chambers in her heart had nt formed properly .she also had turners-syndrome..i found out i was pregnant again on the 28 th of sept after ttc for 7 month today i found out the pregnancy sac is empty and i have to go for a surgical vaccuation on thursday . i just cant believe lightning would strike twice why me? i have a healthy 3 year old boy who keeps me going and a very supportive husband.
2125,my son picks on his face (it used to be around his finger nails before) when he has nothing to do ie. in the car or at night when im reading a book.    i noticed some anxiety when he does it.    he gets a few tiny pimples from it that go away he next day.    once or twice he has picked on a cut that he created.    if i give him 'a lot' of attention and affection he relaxes and stops. by 'a lot' i mean if i hug him through out the day 'a lot' and treat him like a little baby then he starts saying gugu gaga and he is happy.    why?    i have 2 toddlers and i dont have enough free time to do that, what can i do?

2127,we have an 11 year old boy that is wonderful!    he is very intelligent, has a great group of friends, and does well in sporting activities.    however, over the past year until now, he will cry when he doesn't do well at a sporting event.    even if he makes 10 baskets in a row at a game, then misses the next one, he will start to cry.    he also does this on the baseball field.    we have tried everything and do not put any pressure on him, it is the pressure he puts on himself to be perfect.    he does not act like this in school or anywhere else, just on the playing field.    any suggestions as to what we can do to help him control these emotions? thanks!
2128,vitamin d: a weapon against breast cancerif you're a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, all the more reason to have your vitamin-d level checked: research suggests a link between low levels and recurrence of, or death from, the cancer. evidently, low levels of vitamin d are quite common in women diagnosed with breast cancer.naturally, mainstream researchers are quick to back-pedal away from making a recommendation of taking more vitamin d supplements. some doctors would actually rather give you chemo than supplements  i guess they're reluctant to take money out of big pharma's pockets.research has already noted a link between the risk of breast cancer and levels of vitamin d. but researchers are a nervous wreck over recommending getting too much vitamin d.but before they worry about too much, how about focusing on getting your vitamin d levels just right? sure, you can always overdo a good thing, but the point is to know where you are today.i've been talking about the importance of vitamin d for years, back before it became trendy to even think about. i check my patients' 25-hydroxy vitamin d level. levels below 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) are deficient, 20 to 30 borderline, and 30 to 50 healthy. i have sent breast-cancer patients of mine to an eminent integrative oncologist in new york city. he liked to keep his patients' vitamin-d levels between 50 and 60 ng/ml. based on the available evidence, this seems both reasonable and safe, specifically for higher risk patients with a family history of breast cancer, who have had breast cancer themselves, or who are currently being treated for breast cancer.you'll want to work closely with your doctor to get your level back up in the healthy range, which may mean multiple tests to gauge your progress. be patient, but be diligent.dr.i

2130,my son is 4 1/2 years old and is one of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet (most of the time)....however he can turn it off like a switch.    i want to be able to enjoy him the way i always dreamed of when i had children.    i find myself raising my voice more often than not...and yes, spanking his behind....moreso to get his attention....i realize that spanking to some, is not an effective solution. but sometimes i feel that it is the only way to stop him in his tracks.the last two days, he has ran off from me despite telling him to come back...or please stay away from the road, so you can be safe..etc....he looks at me with these devlish grin, and just keeps going.    it's all i can do to contain myself without screaming at the top of my lungs.    he does this running off thing quite often...and i don't know how to get it through to him that this is not appropriate behavior.    for instance, i got a hold of him yesterday, swatted his butt,and took him straight to his room......removed his tv...and explained to him why i was doing that..(you ran away, you could have been hurt..etc)......he says he understands....but the next day he does it again....and again....i feel like i'm consistent with discipline, but i feel that there has to be something else i can try.    above all, i love my boys (3 year old also)0...and i hate yelling....they certainly know how to push my buttons.my boys recently started daycare/preschool...and on friday i got a report that my 4 year old was acting up.    i just want my kids to be respectful and productive members of society.......help?!?i'm just not satisfied that they will grow out of it......i see a lot of    other kids that are their ages, who do not behave in these ways...i realize that it is behavior modification on the parents' part and the childs part...i need help...i would like to establish solid discipline before this becomes a huge problem....

2139,we have a 4 year old daughter who wishes she was a boy. she dresses in boys clothes most of the time and yesterday was grabbing her crotch saying look at my boy pee pee. she is a very cute little girl and wears dresses to events/church/etc. and does not complain to much. she prefers to have boy playmates - but will play with girls no problem. she told me the other day the she does not like princesses even though her friend (girl) told her she should. this is our firts child - so i am not sure if this is normal or something we should discuss further. thanks for any help/insight.
2140,my daughter just turned 7 and ever since she was 4 she found out that it felt good to rub her legs together......at first you can imagine the total shock of my wife and i. we asked our pediatrician if it was normal and she said yes, but as she has gotten older it gets quite embarrasing at times because she will almost do it anywhere. my parents watch her when she is not in school, and they just think something is majorly wrong. i was told that she is too young to comprehend what she is doing and leave her alone. the more we try and stop it or make it an issue, the more she does it.is there something we should do or could do to stop it or slow it down......i don't know but we are helpless.............she did have to leave my parents when she was 3 to go to day care for a while and then it started.....could it have been a result of her whole life changing at that point.....signed please help
2141,my son has been potty trained for about 2 yrs. for the last three nights he has pooped in his pants and won't tell anyone. i don' understand.
2142,recently i caught my 6 yr old daughter with a male cousin showing each other their private parts, touching & kissing.    when asked what they were doing she said they were acting like they were married.    my husband & i are divorced & she never saw anything between us.    then i caught her playing with herself.    is this normal curiousity or cause for concern
2143,my daughter has had ongoing toileting issues since the age of 3.    she is 8 years old and refuses to wipe after urinating.    this behaviour has replaced several years of putting off going to the bathroom and denying that she has to go when asked.    any suggestions?    i have taken her to a developmental pediatrician, and she suggested paying her to keep her underpants dry and clean.    it obviously did not work.
2144,im taking whey protein ryt now but im also planning to take metathione 250mg so is there any side effects if im going to take these 2 supplements simultaneously?    thanks and more power
2145,hello- new topic for me- my neighbors have a 4 yr old boy whom i babysit and see while visiting (i'm friends w/ the mom) the little boy is very smart, but yet, his behavior is unbelievable. he is in total control of his mother, and what i have seemed to noticed, he does not like his mom to pay attention to anyone else but him. if we are talking in the kitchen, he has to be right there in the middle of us, while there are other kids, the dad in the living room... while i ask him to let his mommy have adult time, he will start screaming and crying at the top of his lungs, he will throw things, use the f word. he will get so upset, he will litterally fall to the ground like a 2 yr old having a temper tantrum. he always wants to do what the adults are doing (i know kids are curious) but, it gets to the point where he hurts himself. his mom was cooking and he wanted to flip the eggs like mom. mom kept telling him to get away from the stove because the stove is hot, and he could get hurt. he looked right at her then stuck his hand right on the tip of the pan. he will not listen, ever- when i babysit, i set rules. example, when we were outside, i said he couldn't leave the yard. he looked at me and ran right down the side walk. when i went to get him, he tells me he fin hates me, then the temper tantrum comes. the mom also has a 2 yr old who does the same. she actually had a nervous breakdown and spent 5 days on the psych floor. the father is never home, but the mother never ever grounds, gives him time out. there is no winning, reasoning w/ this child. you can be nice as nice, give him the 3 second count, and he will not listen. i stopped babysitting, but when i still visit- its total caos. stopped visiting, but when i call, we cant talk cause the kids are screaming so loud we can't hear each other. i tried to give the mom advice, but she doesn't listen and just gives him his way, no matter what. when they were leaving the other day, she stopped real quick, i was standing outside her car while she was asking me something, and the 4 yr old kept screaming, mommy! go! i want to go! and because she was talking real quick, he took his chocolate milk and just dropped it to splatter everywhere... (which she wouldn't let him have, but he won) is this normal? my daughter didn't act like this, all kids are different, though. is it the parents? what would be the best advice to give her w/ out offending her parenting skills... i'm telling ya, this would be the biggest show for the nanny- i have never, ever seen a four year old act like this... ever-    thank you.
2146,i am a school psychologist and am currently assessing a    3 1/2 year old student who suffers from significant constipation. the doctors he is seeing are relating the disorder to control. the assessment is revealing that although he has intact speech and language skills he does not use his speech often....he is very quiet. autism has been ruled out. he is also extremely moody and often tantrums. my gut tells me that much of his behavior can be connected to the constipation due to the fact that he most likely doesn't feel good. my question is if anyone knows of the behavioral implications for children who suffer from significant constipation.
2147,i am in a three year relatonship with a man the has went from a twelve pack of regular beer to a case or more of ice beer a day. he has not seen his young children much in the three years. both his parents died from cancer four years ago within six months of each other. i have talked to him, tried to get him to get help. he has been drinking for 25 years and i believe he has cirrohsis of the liver. it has seriously affected our relationship and i cry alot. i want to help him but it seems he does not want to change. i feel like i am slowly watching the man i love kill himself nad i do not know what to do. he is now making me feel like i wish i could just die myself because he is hurtful to me mentally yet i can not seem to leave him. please help me, i do not want to watch him kill himself yet i love him so much i do not want to be without him. what options can i try?
2148,i had a liver transplant when i was 2 years old i am now 24.is it possible that you can live with out medication and if not how long would it be till you went into rejection.i was on medicine till about four years ago when i couldnt afford it anymore.i took the main medicine for rejection until then.i am not going to try to spell it because i have no clue how to.any information would help
2149,for 17 yrs my mother took care of her colostomy, but now she has developed dementia and can no longer care for herself. she uses a 2 piece colostomy, with a wafer and a bag, and has always used stomahesive powder, but everytime i change it for her now it leaks, do you need to let the stomahesive powder set up for 15 minutes b4 you add the wafer? or add the wafer and let it set up like that for 15 minutes.? mom was always a very private person and never saw the need for me to learn how to change her colostomy. thanks for the help.
2150,my 3 1/2 year old was born with a cleft in his soft palate which was repaired successfully at one year. he is still not talking well and many people except for myself, grandparents, aunts etc find it difficult to understand what he is saying. he has started school and the teacher has complained about his behavior. he sucks his forefinger (this started soon after i stopped his bottle last july), takes his shoes and socks off in class (we do this at home or when entering another person's home), suddenly gets up and wanders off when the teacher is teaching, shows difficulty in writing and understanding what she says. she says that he is immature for a child his age and fondles her breast and wants to be carried sometimes. he used a pacifier for the 1st year and we had to discontinue it after the repair. that was when he started touching my breast for comfort. i have told him not to do it and he hardly does it now. he started speech therapy 2 weeks ago and has improved already. but because of his lack of coherent speech his classmates do not understand him so he has no best friend as such but he does play football and run around with them. the school counsellor says that he might be autistic because of this. i think that's an unfair diagnosis because of his cleft palate. he knows his colours, numbers 1-50, sings, can read alphabets and match words, do puzzles well. he babbles but also speaks in sentences of up to 4 words. when i sit with him, he writes his standing and    sleeping lines well, joins the dots, colours nicely and is constantly asking for evaluation by saying, mama look, mama look.    his ent and pediatrician say that he appears normal and intelligent to them. he loves going to school and calls his teacher his best friend but i think that he is frustrated that people cannot understand him and behaves like that. is he autistic?
2151,why msg is so dangerousone of the best overviews of the very real dangers of msg comes from dr. russell blaylock, a board-certified neurosurgeon and author of   excitotoxins: the taste that kills.   in it he explains that msg is an excitotoxin, which means it overexcites your cells to the point of damage or death, causing brain damage to varying degrees -- and potentially even triggering or worsening learning disabilities, alzheimer  s disease, parkinson  s disease, lou gehrig  s disease and more.part of the problem also is that free glutamic acid is the same neurotransmitter that your brain, nervous system, eyes, pancreas and other organs use to initiate certain processes in your body.[4] even the fda states:  studies have shown that the body uses glutamate, an amino acid, as a nerve impulse transmitter in the brain and that there are glutamate-responsive tissues in other parts of the body, as well.abnormal function of glutamate receptors has been linked with certain neurological diseases, such as alzheimer's disease and huntington's chorea. injections of glutamate in laboratory animals have resulted in damage to nerve cells in the brain.  [5]although the fda continues to claim that consuming msg in food does not cause these ill effects, many other experts say otherwise.according to dr. blaylock, numerous glutamate receptors have been found both within your heart's electrical conduction system and the heart muscle itself. this can be damaging to your heart, and may even explain the sudden deaths sometimes seen among young athletes.he says:  when an excess of food-borne excitotoxins, such as msg, hydrolyzed protein soy protein isolate and concentrate, natural flavoring, sodium caseinate and aspartate from aspartame, are consumed, these glutamate receptors are over-stimulated, producing cardiac arrhythmias.when magnesium stores are low, as we see in athletes, the glutamate receptors are so sensitive that even low levels of these excitotoxins can result in cardiac arrhythmias and death.  [6]many other adverse effects have also been linked to regular consumption of msg, including:obesityeye damageheadachesfatigue and disorientationdepressionfurther, even the fda admits that   short-term reactions   known as msg symptom complex can occur in certain groups of people, namely those who have eaten   large doses   of msg or those who have asthma.[7]according to the fda, msg symptom complex can involve symptoms such as:numbnessburning sensationtinglingfacial pressure or tightnesschest pain or difficulty breathingheadachenausearapid heartbeatdrowsinessweaknessno one knows for sure just how many people may be   sensitive   to msg, but studies from the 1970s suggested that 25 percent to 30 percent of the u.s. population was intolerant of msg -- at levels then found in food. since the use of msg has expanded dramatically since that time, it  s been estimated that up to 40 percent of the population may be impacted.[8]how to determine if msg is in your foodfood manufacturers are not stupid, and they  ve caught on to the fact that people like you want to avoid eating this nasty food additive. as a result, do you think they responded by removing msg from their products? well, a few may have, but most of them just tried to   clean   their labels. in other words, they tried to hide the fact that msg is an ingredient.how do they do this? by using names that you would never associate with msg.you see, it  s required by the fda that food manufacturers list the ingredient   monosodium glutamate   on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredients that contain free glutamic acid, even though it  s the main component of msg.there are over 40 labeled ingredients that contain glutamic acid,[9] but you  d never know it just from their names alone. further, in some foods glutamic acid is formed during processing and, again, food labels give you no way of knowing for sure.tips for keeping msg out of your dietin general, if a food is processed you can assume it contains msg (or one of its pseudo-ingredients). so if you stick to a whole, fresh foods diet, you can pretty much guarantee that you  ll avoid this toxin.the other place where you  ll need to watch out for msg is in restaurants. you can ask your server which menu items are msg-free, and request that no msg be added to your meal, but of course the only place where you can be entirely sure of what  s added to your food is in your own kitchen.to be on the safe side, you should also know what ingredients to watch out for on packaged foods. here is a list of ingredients that always contain msg:autolyzed yeast    calcium caseinate gelatinglutamate glutamic acid hydrolyzed proteinmonopotassium glutamate monosodium glutamate    sodium caseinatetextured protein yeast extract yeast foodyeast nutrientthese ingredients often contain msg or create msg during processing:[10]flavors and flavorings seasonings    natural flavors and flavorings    natural pork flavoring natural beef flavoringnatural chicken flavoring soy sauce    soy protein isolate    soy protein    bouillonstock    broth    malt extract    malt flavoring    barley maltwhey protein carrageenan    maltodextrin    pectin    enzymesprotease    corn starch    citric acid    powdered milk    anything protein fortifiedanything enzyme modified anything ultra-pasteurizedso if you do eat processed foods, please remember to be on the lookout for these many hidden names for msg.wow......i always label read for msg, but now it brings on a whole new meaning to label reading.....maybe i need to bring a label information book!! these companies are sooooo sneaky about slipping it in!!
2152,i contracted clostridium difficile most likely either from an e.r. visit b/c of an ear infection, or the antibiotics used to treat it.    i was 7-1/2 mths pregnant and complained for 3 weeks of diarrhea.    no doctors listened to me.    4 weeks later, 1 week after the birth of my daughter, i was finally diagnosed upon return to the e.r. for severe abdominal pain.    i was given flagyl and vancomyacin and improved for 2 days or so. (i was receiving half of the cdc recommended dose of each)    i began to get worse after those two days and the antibiotics were never increased or changed until 24 hrs before being medi-flighted to a hospital that wasn't willing to just let me die.    upon arrival, i was told if my entire colon was not removed that night, i would be dead before any antibiotics would take affect.    my body was so infected and sick, they removed 5 liters of fluid off my abdomin(abdomen)(2 liters were removed at the first hospital, as they thought at first it was my appendix)    i spent 5 days in icu and another week and a half recovering in the hospital.my actual question:    had the first hospital increased my dosage of flagyl and vancomyacin when i first showed signs of relapse (or just worsening) or tried some other antibiotic, could the severity of my illness, and ultimately my total colectomy possibly have been avoided?
2153,my step son has lived with his mother and her grandparents since he was 3 months old.    he and his mother not only share a room, but the bed.    at our house, he has his own room, space, and 'big boy' bed.we have determined that my step son has two different personalities in each home.    at our home, my husband and i also have a 5 month old.    my step son adores him and helps out.    he helps me with the laundry, dishes, and sometimes cooking food.    he's involved a lot.    however, he does not like to be in a room by himself.    for example, if we are all outside and he has to potty, he will not come inside to go with out one of us.    he is very polite and well behaved. at his mom's residents it's a totally different story.    he has told us that he will play and pee himself, because he doesn't want to stop what he's doing.    he told us that he has a 'pee basket' where he puts his wet clothes. his mother tells us that he is completely disrepectful to her, and her grandparents.    he throws temper tantrums if he doesn't get his way. they do not interact with him, they just put him in front of the tv, because it's easier. he has spit, and thrown toys at his mother. his mother took him to a psychogist and the doctor told us and the mother that my step son would be better living with us and his mother having visition. once the doctor told her that, she removed him from therapy.    sometimes he stares off into space, and ingores when someone is speaking to him.    just 2 weeks ago the mother told my husband that their son told her 'mommy one day you are going to be under water'    'maybe i'll want you dead'    we are really concerned where this is coming from.    yesterday at school, he got mad at another student and said 'i'll shoot you in your tummy'what should we do?    we have tried to remove him from that home.    the courts told her to get her own place, and she has a section 8 apartment, but refuses to live there.    we have fought twice for custody and both times we did not get my step son. the judge said she did not have enough 'material change' for her to remove him from that home.what should we do?    we are really concerned for his well being and mentality. please help
2154,my 7 yr old daughter was in the bathroom yesterday for quite a while so i went to check on her....the door was open so i just walked in after knocking and found her hand in the toilet and noticed her hand had feces on it....i just shrugged it off as one of those things, though i did let her know it was wrong and to not do it again. she said she wouldn't.    just a short time ago she was doing it again...she claims the feces was on the seat and she just stuck her hand in it, but i don't believe it.    why would she do this all of a sudden? i am worry wart so please help me understand what to do, if anything.    i am going to have a talk with her now to see if anything is bothering her.    she is a normal, bright, bubbly, happy 7 yr old so this is totally out of character for her.    thanks in advance!

2156,my son is 6 years old and things that he do are not in the norm.    one of the things he do is he still weight on himself whether its in when he is sleep or playing with someone and they are wrestling.    the most unsanitary thing he do is he will stand and pass a bowel movement on himself and than try to hind it by wiping it off of him with paper or wet wipes.    he started doing this at the age of 4 where he would put the feces all over the walk or on his toys.    he is a very smart boy but he has anger problems and doing this is like the last straw for me.    i want to get him some help before he grows into a man and do things i dont even want to think about.    people tell me dont put him on any drugs just discipline him in other ways.    i have tried that and he do well for a while and then the minute he is left alone in a bedroom he do these nasty things.    i'm lost how to i help my son before this turns into something horrible.very concerned mom help!
2157,i have a 5 yr old boy that recently started kindergarten.    he was in daycare all his life, pre-school etc.    kindergarten has been a little hard for him sometimes behaving.    not daily or anything like that, my wife and i have not really been tolerant to the notes home.anyway, yesterday at the store he told his mom that he heard a voice telling him that his mother was stupid.    this really upset her.    he told her it kept saying it.    then on the way out to the car i heard him whisper my mom isn't stupid.    now i don't know if he was saying that to appease his upset mother or what.    not really observing what happened i looked him dead in the face and told him to knock it off.    i asked him right after bucking him in if he still heard the voice and he said no but started asking questions.    hes an advanced kid, talked early and all that stuff.    his story telling and imagination is very advanced, always was.    he can talk his way out of a lot.    hes not a badly behaved kid and liked by all his friends, teachers etc.    anyway, during the ride home he said he hears talking in his head a lot.    i asked him if it was his voice and he said yes.later that night when i had him alone.    i asked him if he heard it in his head and just said it out loud and explained to him about thoughts and your own voice.    i talk to myself a lot.    so does my father.    i mean in our head not out loud.    i am the kind of person that constantly problem solves in my head.    hes also an very concerned kid, thinks and asks about everything.    anyway, hes never mentioned it before.    i have to admit there is a fair amount of verbal arguing in the house.    i'm sure that doesn't help with all the pressure he is under.    i wonder if we just need to calm things down for him and are there other triggers that i should look out for.the only other thing he has complained about is a headache now and again when hes tired.    its rare and goes away on it own.    he has amblyopia (lazy eye) in one eye and gets patched so when he is over tired can get a headache but again, we are not even talking 5 times in his life.    eye doctor says this is normal.i am thinking i have an overly imaginative kid who is a little too analytical for his own good.    i also think maybe all the yelling in the house is stressing him.    he might have even heard me say to my wife your being stupid, who knows. i am obviously concerned and even more upset that we have done this to him indirectly.    he such a caring, loving kid.    shows a ton of affection etc.i have read about ocd on his board but i really haven't seen any sign of that that i would know about. no issues with moods or anything either.    what do you think?
2158,my mother believes that 85% of a child's personality and disposition is genetic and is responsible for how children turn out, the remaining 15% is influenced by a combination of societal, scholastic and aprental influences.    i am stunned.    i believe that the primary influence is parental, despite individual personality inclination.    please weigh on this.
2159,yes alot of people dont understand methadone clinics or use and if they would really take the time and open there mind to see what my life was like before the clinic ad now after oh i think alot of them would def. change their minds i mean it has saved my life and not just mine but my kids even though they r young and dont really know bout the clinic they know momma has to go get her medicine to stay well and if ask them do they prefer the old mommy or the new mommy well the look on their excited lil faces to say my new mommy she is the greatest and that makes me know why i did but yes i was like everyone else i thought well ill go to the clinic    so i can get some dope everyday and it will be cheaper than the streets and it will be there cuz i was so tired of being broke and the everyday grind of the hunt well if u were an addict you know wht the is like    but once i got through with my intake tht day i said well im gonna give it a shot cause i had a wonderful counselor and i thought well here are these ppl that are willing to help me so why not take advantage and help myself so i took it seriously and i have been clean [or methadone only] for 3 years now but some ppl always wanna say well u jst traded all drugs for one well the way i see it is i have health and mental health problems and im gonna be on perscrption med all my life and as long as i take them right well then im ok the way i explain it to most is    wht if i had a terminal illnes which is what addiction really is cuz if u dont get help u r gonna die so if i had cancer shouldnt i take the meds to help me live so that is what methadone is for me but since then i have left and got a divorce from my addict abusive husband i have moved in with the greatest guy now he has never done drugs and he supports me as much as he can understand how to also the first time i paid a bill ontime oh wow it was like the frst line of cocain hahahah to me i was so excited i was broke again but hey those lights werent gettin cut oof on my kids and groc. in the fridge had my own apartment till i moved into my big noce home with my luv nad my kids well they have a great spoiled life now hahahah i dont know if i would still be here to be a mom if i hadnt strtd the clinic 3 yrs ago so if my story helps one person then its worth it to write it my mom was against the clinic till it saved my life but i didnt tell her till she noticed a difference in me and then she said well u know how i feel bout tht stuff but if tht has done this to u ill support u all i know how and then i got my brother strtd it saved his life or he never would have known all the dope he was doing had caused a heart infection and now he is 29 yrs old and has to have heart valve replacment surgery    but she said for the first time in a long time i hve my kids back and now she is a beleiver    if u need to talk or jst get me your story i would love to read it we need more positive education on methadone use
2160,for 6 years my daughter has been asking for a baby sister. well, after 5 years of trying and tons of heart break we have achieved this. i am now 18 weeks pregnant and found out 2 days ago it is indeed a girl. since then my daughter has been very distant and uninterested in anything to do w/ the baby. yesterday i went out and bought a bunch of stuff for the baby and when i got home i was all excited and showing my kids (i have a 14 yr old son as well) when my daughter told me all i care about is the baby. i could not believe what i was hearing. i had to realy push to get her to tell me what was going on. then she broke down crying and told me she is afraid her stepdad won't love her anymore because now he will have a real daughter. (my husband has been the only father she has ever known and her bio dad is no where in the picture.) i told her that was not true and that his love for her would never change. she said we were replacing her w/ the baby and that he would no longer have time for her. i explained that baby's do take alot of time and attention, but that we were hoping she would be there to help as well. i explained we want her very involved and that her relationship w/ this baby was going to be very important. being 15 years older and the big sis, trinity (the baby) would probly be coming to her for things she doesn't feel she can come to us about. she just told me she wasn't going to be around. she was sobbing and i could tell she was very upset. she's 15 and i never thought we would have this issue at this age. i don't know what else to say to convience her that we will always love her very much and nothing will ever take that away. i asked my husband to talk to her, but i'm not even sure if that will help since i couldn't get through to her. does anyone have any sugestions what we can do????
2161,has anyone worked with national ultrasound, inc., or medcorp to purchase equipement? just wanted to know if they are reputable to deal with.    thanks
2162,i am looking for some ways to , on scheduled    basis, track my 16 years old is, making sure he's in school and he's in where he says he is. i know there's mobile software out there that can spy the location but that's not what i want to do. i am looking for a more preventive measure instead. i want to be able to make sure he goes to school, or be at home by curfew when i work out of town. meanwhile, i want to respect his privacy and give him some room during the freedom time.i am a busy single parent and i don't have time to monitor him 24/7. is there any software that helps me to monitor my boy? once again, i want to give him some degree of freedom and start treating him like an adult. but it is unacceptable that he just makes stay out late while i am out of the states for work..
2163,for the last 2 and half to 3 years my daughter, who is now 9 has had issues with having accidents. she has several accidents a day with bm. it started around the time i got pregnant with my youngest, so we just assumed it was due to trying to deal with that, but it just kept continuing. now years later, we have tried everything. we have taken her to a family doctor who ran a few tests (for parasites, blood in her bm, etc.) when nothing came of that he recommended a pediatric gasternologist (he is suppose to be the best here in tucson). we went to see him, followed his order to a t and tried to help her as much as possible. last month he said that he doesn't need to see her because she is doing much better. which is not the case at all, and i let him know how i felt. i have yet to see any improvement. we done everything he has said, enemas, laxitives, stool softners, fiber, diet. i have to admit, my husband does get frustrated at times, my husband tells her a lot to stop being so lazy. i dont know if thats really the case at all or if she truly cant feel the urge. i was confiding to a close friend about this and she said it sounds like she could have something called encopresis. i have researched it a little and feel that is a good possiblity. i asked our family doctor about it, and he refered me to the same doctor. it's just a continous circle with no hope in sight. i dont know what else to do. sometimes i feel so sorry for my daughter because this can't be easy for her. she has accidents at school, and she smells bad. we send extra clothes and have talked to her principal and teacher. my fear is that it will never end and what kind of life will my daughter have. please if you know where i can get help for my daughter, let me know.

2167,my son is going to be 3 in january and has uncontrolable tantrums and i don't want to beat or whip him. we have a history from my side of uncontrolable tantrums and i think it's in the genes, but i don't want it to be the excuse for his behavior. he wears me out when we are outside. i need some help! should we see a psychologist?
2168,any kids do anything similar to this? my 3 yr loves bellies. he has always done this. if he sees someone belly he wants to touch it. we have been at the mall and he'll see a girl wearing a short shirt and will go and lift her shirt to see her belly. another example is my sil used to think it was cute that he wanted to see her belly and feel how soft it was. so she let him see and touch. now he won't leave her alone. everytime she comes over as soon as she sits down he'll ask her to see her belly. when he was younger everyone thought it was a cute thing to do so family and freinds would show their bellies to him. but when i started to noticed that he wanted to do it to everyone where ever we went i started to tell him not to. usally he'll stop, but every so often i' ll see him trying to look a someone belly. like we were at a playland and i heard him asking a 3 yr olf girl can i see your belly. she thought he was funny. i went and told him not and he didn't do it again. .i have asked his teacher about it at school and she said she hasn't seen him do it. i know at first i would laugh and so would most people so maybe he thinks its something to get attention for. but i stopped thinking it was cute a long time ago. he don't do it as often but every so often he will.i know this sounds really odd. i just not sure what to think about this. i never heard of a kid doing this before. thanksbnik
2169,i have 2 children, a step-daughter that is 4 1/2 and a son that will 4 in a few weeks. our household has been intragated for the last 4 years. my step-daughters mother (further mentioned as mom)wanted nothing to do with her after she found out what a pain (her words) having a child was and forfited sole custody to myself and my (now) husband. so all her life she had grown up with me as mommy. that is until about a year ago. mom ran into me and my daughter out at the market. my daughter didn't know who she was so she paid no mind to her, i on the other hand knew exactly who she was and was waiting for a comment. which i recieved. mom walked over to us looked at my daughter and said arn't you going to say hi to your mommy? my daughter, very confused at this point, look at me and said who is she? mom proceeded to throw a fit very pissed off that my daughter didn't know who who real mother was. i immediately left the store. i spoke with my husband about the issue and suggested we go to family court now to put everything into writing. which we are attempting to do at this point. fast forward to now.the judge as recent as june decided that every weekend visits with mom were nessassary to rebuild mom and daughter's relationship. (against our better judgement we have to let her go) out of the last 15 weeks she has seen her 7 times. mom recently had a new baby and is couch jumping if you will. we recently returned to court requesting supervised visits, no overnights, and child protective services to investigate. our request was granted.mom calles to speak to my husband at least 15 times a day, in which he doesn't answer. when our daughter gets home from daycare, we allow her to call mom, on speaker phone to say hello. we noticed that mom was grilling her for answers and when our daughter would as a simple question such as what are you doing? mom would reply with tell your father it's none of his ******* business, how about that?! i have several times advised her to stop using inappropriate words while on the phone with her and have hung up on her many times b/c of her language. that was as recent as last night.here's my issue:this morning my daughter approached me and said mommy? do i have to call gloria mommy and you by your name? i told her she could call us whatever she felt comfortable with. that passified her for about 2 minutes then she said how come god made her my mommy too? she so mean all the time. i thought mommy's are supposed to be nice and love us? and before i could answer she continued with how come mommy-gloria didn't want me as a baby and gave me to you and daddy? i didn't know what to say. i told her we would talk about it after school. well, school is almost over and i know for sure she is going to re-ask the question......what do i say? do i lie to protect her? to i tell the truth? i am not even sure i know the answer... any suggestions!?
2170,my son has been in a daycare center since he was 2 1/2 yrs old, with a very structured classroom and did great there.    he went to a private kindergarten in a church that only had preschool and 1 kindergarten class, and only 11 students in his class, and he did great there also.    this year, i open enrolled him into a school that had very high ratings (the district we live in is really bad).    a week into the school year, he was sent home for his behavior and started acting up at home and church also.    when i was trying to figure out what was wrong (it was obvious that something was bothering him), he didn't know, but then told me he sometimes thinks about killing himself.    there was a suicide early this year that i was not able to keep him from knowing about, so i think he got the idea from that.    i called his pediatrician for a referral- was told i had to bring him to children's er, so i did.    at the hospital, we each talked with a social worker who said that when kids his age say that, it is usually because they feel like it would be easier if they weren't there.    she said she saw no indication of him harming himself, and referred us to a play therapist.    he has been seeing the therapist for over a month now, and she told me on tuesday that she is not seeing any signs of any emotional problems with him.    instead, she is very impressed with what she is seeing, and said that when he tries something, he will not give up until he gets it right, and will not cheat either.    she said most kids would either give up, or cheat and think she doesn't notice, but he is determined to do his very best until he gets it.    i was very happy to hear that- but the problems at school are getting worse every day.    outside of school, it only lasted about a week, and he has been completely back to normal (or even better behaved...) at home, church, and daycare.    but nothing is working for school.    they are doing sticker charts, and his evenings at home with me are dependent on his day at school.    if he had a good day, then he gets to have a fun night at home.    if not- then he has everything taken away at home and has to do something that he considers boring until it is bedtime.    he has occasional good days- but i would say 75% are bad.    just over a month into the school year, i had to leave work today for the 5th time to get him already.    the last 3 times, he has been so worked up when i got there, that he is throwing things and hiding under tables, and even pushing me away from him.    i can't calm him down until the principal leaves the room, and then i have to hug him to get him to relax.    there was a day last week that his whole body was bright red and he was dripping in sweat from the fighting (and fear that i could clearly see in his eyes- the school insists that the only one to be afraid of there is him).    he has been doing completely random and crazy things at school to disrupt the class, and can't handle the results of it.they had me sit through his class one day a couple weeks ago, and all the kids were out of control, doing the things they tell me he does, while he was sitting quietly next to me.    another parent was the mystery reader the next day and said she had to stop reading at least 10 times because they were all so wild.    the current teacher is a long term sub while the regular teacher is on maternity leave, and this is her first time teaching alone.    i think a lot of his problem is the chaos in the room, and he is reacting to that.    he is a child that will react a lot to what is going on around him, and get excited and then not know when to stop- so would probably take things further than the other kids if he gets to that point.    the school won't tell me, but i saw other kids having a lot of the same problems as him, and he is telling me every day about someone else going to the principals office from his class (which is where he spends most of his days...).    the teacher is great, very nice, but i think too nice.    when they explain to me the things that happened, it always starts with well, we were sitting on the floor and he was rolling around and not sitting, but that wasn't a big deal so i let it go.    i have told her many times to end it there, because if he is allowed to do that, it will only spiral from there.    but every time i still keep hearing about things that weren't a big deal to start with so she just let it go.    and i am also told she can't stop the class to make him sit.    but he has learned now that no one will do anything, so why not do it?    last week they started documenting the things he was doing and suspended him for a day.    today he was suspended again for 2 days, and they had him in a room that is used for occupational therapy because they said if he throws things in there, its all soft, and they also had a video camera on him to document the behavior.    the principal sat down with me and went through 2 pages of things she wrote down (she has now been in the class all day for almost a week) and how dangerous he is to the rest of the school.    i brought him to the pediatrician, who said if it was something that needed medication, he wouldn't have done so well up until now.    she said it sounded like he needs to be in a new class or a new school.    that was 2 weeks ago, and i really didn't want to do that, but today it reached a point where i don't think there is any other choice.    they are trying to expell him anyway.    the principal insists that the school does everything perfectly and the only problem is that he needs to get it into his head that he can't act like that at school.    i can guarantee- its already in his head.    he never knows why he does any of it.    but i bring him every morning in a good mood, and excited and determined to work hard and have a better day.    it just doesn't last after i leave.    i have not been happy with the way the principal talks to him like he is just bad and needs to change, i can see in his face that it is only making it worse, but she doesn't care what the cause of the problem is or what needs to be done to help him.    (at least not from my view- or his dr's or therapists...)    last week they started special ed assessments, to see if there is anything special ed could help with, even though his academics are great.    he loves school- and loves doing his homework.    but i think he is giving up now.    after the suspension last week, they started having the principal sit in his class to watch him, which i knew would not go well because it is only with her that he gets worked up and can't calm himself down.    4 days of that, and i have left work for him twice.    today she told me that he can't handle being around kids, and thats why its only at school, and has nothing to do with anything at school.    but he goes to daycare after school and is doing fine there, went to church tonight (after the horrible day with the video camera) for his wednesday night class, and they said he was great there. he's always been around other kids and has been fine.    he says he likes all the kids, they are all nice, and no one picks on him.    no one has hurt him or touched him or anything (that he will admit, but he is usually very open with me and will tell me things that he would get away with otherwise, because he realizes the results of telling me himself will be better than not telling me- and he knows he can talk to me about anything).i really feel like it is time to go to another school.    when we left school today, i did let him know that i wasn't happy about what happened, but then i dropped it and didn't say another word about it.    instead i took him to the school that would have been my next choice, and registered him to start there next week.    i requested a teacher that is good at handling a class and experienced, so he is with one that has been there for 24 years and is the lead of.    my fear is- what do i do next if he still has problems?
2171,just into the second week in january this year, our little granddaughter aged 3 returned home from an overnight stay with her father.    we met up with our daughter within the hour as we had arranged to go out for a meal with them.    on seeing them i noted that our little granddaughters hair did not looked brushed and she looked shattered.    she greeted me as she always does with open arms and a big kiss then she begun to cry.    all evening she was very subdued, pale, and then she called mum at the table 'stinky' 'you are stinky'.    this is not a term we use at all, especially directed at anyone and in such a tone.    i babysat her that week on the mon, wed and thurs.    all three nights were very distressing.    refusing to do anything and everything.    hand in mouth.    hiding under the stairs looking very frightened to come out.    hiding under the breakfast bar on the wednesday, and crying, and looking scared and wary and then after a long period of about 30 mins would break down.    apologising, for being bad.    saying sorry when it isn't appropriate.    lashing out and kicking, refusing to get undressed at bedtime, in the mornings refusing to get dressed.     speaking in an ugly manner and shouting.    screwing up her face during all of this.    throwing her bedtime books all over the floor.    refusing bedtime stories.     not letting us brush her hair, pushing the mirror off the dressing table. don't this and don't want that. pointing into my face and her own and then pointing between her legs,    when i offered no response she did it again, her expression was hard to read.    i told her i didn't understand.    she just run off.     being aggressive with the pets, we have a dog and a cat.    being aggressive with us.on the following sat we had tickets to go see sleeping beauty.    she has been before.    on this occasion her spark had gone.    gone from being a happy animated child to a zombie.this all happened within one week.    the second and third week was just as eventful.    we contacted gateway, a social welfare network for protecting children.    they     advised no contact with the father and that it would be investigated.    4 weeks later they sent a very young girl to assess our little granddaughter, she only has had one, one hr assessment to date.    by this time emma was having good spells.    meantime the fathers father, took mum to court to resume access, despite mum explaining to father,    the    change in her behaviour.    the judge held mum in contempt of court, and a summons would be issued if she stopped contact, and jail.     the report provided by the social worker from gateway summed it up as borderline and basically made it look like its just a petty feud between parents.     visitation was reinstated.    my daughter begged for supervision.    supervision was granted by the court but only by any member of his family.    which defeated the purpose of the whole supervision request.     the whole experience has been gutt wrenching.    our solicitor did not prepare us for anything.    when the application for court was received by the fathers solicitor, the only advice he could offer was that that was foolish for them to do that and that we would just have to go with it.we have contacted a psychologist.    privately.    we have changed solicitors.we have so far felt let down by the system.     i can understand now how children can be open to abuse as the lack of interest in the social care is amazing.    this is now march and still no more word about assessments which was promised.    also they said that there would be no access while assessments were done.    however, when court contacted them by phone the social worker who did the one assessment, felt that the father posed no threat.    based on one visit.our granddaughter has changed dramatically, lost her confidence, her spark, her warm loving embraces are now few.    since visitation started back last saturday the drama has returned..there have been 2 visits since the court date.    on both those dates on returning our grandddaughter displays alot of aggression, hatred, namecalling and lashing out.does this really sound like a family feud?     if my spelling and grammar have deteriorated its because i am weary.mother is so much distressed too she doesn't know where to turn, she is started counselling with lifeline, to keep her head throughout this ordeal.i do know that creche say she talks about us all the time.    fondly about all the antics we get up to.    they report this daily to us.    i know she does this at her fathers or wherever she goes.    but oddly we never hear anything much from her about fathers side of the family about what she does.     a member of staff at the creche did disclose to me that she has only mentioned her dads name recently.my question is this.     what help is there out there for us.    will the psychologist shine some light?    she is only 3.    will the court allow her to interview the father?    this is so important.    this is a plea, a prayer, to stop what is evidently destroying a beautiful being.    if there is anything else we should know, or can do, please help.this discussion is related tosudden behavior changes in 3 year old.

2176,ok i have search online for days and keep seeing the same thing...my daughter is 5 and masturbates all the time. i have asked dr. after dr. what is going on they all say it is normal. i get this but she is 5. i am trying to understand it being normal but it is just frustrating to me. i mean i don  t even know if you call it masturbating but she says it tickles. my first thought was someone touch her i went nuts i found out this was not the case she just likes doing it. what should i do?
2177,hi i am    33 years old i had my hysterectomy done in 2006 with them taking out my uterus and left olvery i had endometriosis bad so a year later he took out my other olvery with him stating to me that the pain should go away since he had gotten everything out. things seemed to be getting better but about six or eight months later i started having stomache pain again not thinking it should have anything to do with my hysterectomy so i started seeing my colon specialites to make sure i didnt have endometriosis on on colon or any other things that might be going on so i had three ct scans and nothing showing up on any except for one where it looked like i might have a kidney stone. my colon dr put me all diffrent kinds of medicine for over a year. i ended up getting my appendix taken out last week and the dr had to get a ogbyn to help asist because he thought he had found a piece of my fallopian tube that was all nuckeled up irritaing my kidneys, my appendix was just fine but they still removed it. the pathology report came back and it stated no fallopian tube but piece of olvery that formed a olvarian cyst. now i do believe when a dr tells you they got everything out and that things should be getting better shouldnt come back and bite ya. when a diffrent dr has to fix what one didnt do. for the last year and a half i have been dealing with bad stomache pain and i have a daughter and    twin boys    and not being able to get out and play and do certain things with them really upsets me.i have alot of people telling me that i have a law suit but im not sure if i would have a case or not. has anyone ever gone threw something like this or close? please help

2179,my little brother tries on my bra's and knickers at any times possible he'll sneak off, strip naked and try them on. he has only just turned 3 a couple of weeks ago, this has been going on for about a year. its not just my underwear its any bra's or knickers that he can find. my mum and my dad tell him off for this, i just egnore it but take back my underwear. i am not sure if this is possible but i think it may be sexual as he has an erection whilst he does this? apart from this his behaviour is quite normal and boyish.

2183,hi,glad i found this forum.     i would up in the emergency at the end of september with severe abdominal pain.    i hadn't been to a gynecologist since my last child was born 9 years ago.     well    they found a large mass in my abdomen.    they wouldn't operate right away as they were waiting for tumor markers to come back to see if they were elevated.    they were, so i was transferred out of that hospital to another one to a doctor that specialized with ovarian cancer.so they took everything, both ovaries, they said one was a size of a softball and it was bleeding.    the other one didn't look good, so they took that one too.     pathology came back, no cancer, praise to god.it's been 5 weeks, and i want to get on some hormones.from what i have read, estrogen plays a vital role in a woman's health.    bones, heart disease, skin, hair, eyes, the list just goes on.    i am 41 years old, and i feel i have just catapulted myself into old age by 10 years.i just went to the doctors today for my post surgery appt, they said everything looked good.     they do not recommend hormone therapy unless i would be experiencing severe symptoms.i want to get on bio-identical hormones.    i feel the medical community frowns upon these, but how do i go about finding a doctor?    i assume i would need blood tests to check my hormone levels, and i would need a prescription to take to a compounding pharmacy.     i have asked 2 doctors, both gynecologists about them, and they both said they would only prescribe the synthetic ones if need be.how do i locate someone to lead me down the path of bio-identicals.i am located in pa.thank you,

2187,my almost 5yr old son has been potty trained since he was 2 with the exception of bm's. he has consistently refused to even try. he was put on a stool softener last year due to him holding bm's and causing both intenstines to become impacted. he did that to himself when starting preschool and not wanting to have an accident there. he continues to refuse to use the toilet no matter what reward or take-away system we try. we tried taking away his pull-ups but after a full month of having to continually throw away pair upon pair of underwear and pants we went back to pull-ups. he simply does not care wether it is a pull up or underwear. he will go in either one equally. he has claimed to be scared of of the toilet although he pees in it just fine and has given me no reason as to why he would be scared. he will tell me time and time again that he will go on the potty. he knows that is what i want to hear and does not want to go to the doctor yet again. he rarely has an accident away from home. he will simply hold his bm untill he is home. he is able to do this even though he is on a high dosage of softener to make sure he does not become impacted again.can you please offer me any advice other than wait it out?
2188,hello to all and happy new year.i had a hysterectomy some 12 years ago at age 29 and have been menopaused since then.    i have given up on hrt as i never found the 'right' medicine that works for me.today, i have hashimoto's which is a form of hypothyroid and my endocrinologist has strongly advised me to take hrt.    i had already tried estreva gel 0.1% last year, but coincidentally, when i first started applying the gel as advised, i had terrible abdominal cramps (like labour cramps) and stopped the medicine after a few days of pain.    my ob/gy told me there was no way estreva gel could be the problem and that anyway i couldn't possibly have abdominal cramps as i haven't got a uterus anymore.    confusing, but still, i never took the medicine again........ and the pain was gone.    to this day, i still don't know if i just had a stomach bug or if the cramps were a side effect from taking estreva.i have been taking estreva, again, for 3 weeks now (since my endocrinologist strongly advised me to and reassured me that it would be ok!).    first 2 weeks on a low dose and i was fine besides tender breasts for a few days.    i have increased the dose on the 3rd week (29th december) and started having the most painful lower back pain on 31st december.    i can barely move, it feels like i pulled my back muscles but i know i didn't, it radiates to my sides (almost like constipation pain but i'm not constipated) and down to my legs; no over-the-counter pain killers help.    i have very sensitive kidneys and i cannot tell if it's my lower back or my kidneys hurting so bad.    one thing for sure: estreva gel is the only new medicine i'm taking and nothing else has changed in my diet and medicine taking.i would like to know if any of you have had similar problems with this medicine.    the information i found on the gel doesn't mention anything about back pain but we're human so it could still be.    i'm confused and not even sure i should go to the gp as i have no idea if the two are related.thank you for your help.    anyone suffered the exact same problems with this medicine?

2191,1 year ago i had my uterius remove.    my tubes where tied and they kept my cervics.    every month my breads grow double sizes and they hurt.    i also get my period.    i thought since i don't have a uterius, i should not be getting my period.    i can't seem to find a answer.
2192,my 10 years old son wakes up about 2 to 3 times a night because he is too afraid of ghost to sleep by himself. the problem started about 2 months ago. he told me that he was afraid of the dark and ghost from the scary movies that he had watched with his older cousins when he was about 7 or 8 years old. he said it did not bother him back then because he was too young to know, but now it seems to pop up in his mind when he sleep or being in the dark. he sleep thru the night only when me or my husband sleep with him or if we allow him to sleep in our room. i wonder if anyone else have similar problem or any ideas how to handle this situation and most importantly is this just a phase or can it lead to some other type of problem. i've read couples of article related to this situation on other website but it seems those kids are much younger so i am very concern because my son is going to be in junoir high next year, how much longer do i have to stay with him thru the night.
2193,i hope this is the correct forum for my question.    my father had two strokes in the last seven years.    i am an only child, so my mother and i take care of him.    he no longer works, but sometimes drives to buy groceries since it's close to home.    my question is -- how do you take care of someone who does not want to be taken care of?he is the most stubborn person i know.    my mother is a nurse, yet he won't listen to her when she tells him he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats.    in 2003, he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of papa john's pizza.    we thought that would be his reality check.    guess what?    it wasn't.then 3 years ago, he had a second stroke.    reality check?    no.    he still does not believe in doctors, nor medicine. he has diabetes, just like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.    he also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and arthritis.    he refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes.he has also suffered from depression for years, even before the stroke.    he was married with two children before he met my mother. i'm sure that's one reason why he's been depressed all his life.    not to mention he was the eldest of 8 children and had to leave school to work and take care of them.    he does not want to move in with his brothers and sisters (who are also retired but on the other side of the country), because of pride.lately he's been having memory lapses after waking from naps.    we don't know if these are mini-strokes, or just part of the long-term effects of strokes.    again, he is stubborn; he does not want to call his doctor about this.    he says he's fine, but i'm scared that one day something serious will happen to him.    since i'm an only child, he's home alone whenever my mother's at work and i'm at work or class.    no one is there to watch him and make sure he takes his meds or doesn't overdose on them.    we worry that when he has his memory lapses, he'll overdose on the meds, not realizing he had already taken them.please, if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

2197,hello,i have been reading about the great benefits of ala (alpha lipoic acid) in its ability to act as an antioxidant and also help with energy conversion in the body.however, what really puzzles me is that since ala is produced naturally by our bodies (not an essential nutrient) how come the body doesn't make more of it's own to clean itself from radicals ? does our body knows something that we don't ? maybe ala is not as important as we think ? ... and if we supplement, doesn't it mean that our body will atrophy its own production to compensate for the excess ?also, which tissues, generate that body's own ala ? what mechanisms are involved in its production ?

2200,my 3 and a half year old was born 13 weeks early.    only had cpap help - no ventilator as he could breath on his own.'he is a very, very bright - intelligent, happy child; a normal 3 year old.    except for a couple of things.    he won't be toilet trained - especially for number 2's.    he will sit on the toilet - has no problems there and will do wee's -    but nothing more.    he won't wear undies - he told me this morning he doesn't like the feel of them on his 'bits'.    prefers the nappy.    i am intending to buy him some boxer shorts to see how he goes with them.he has also taken to talking to his food at dinner time.    he's fine with breakfast and lunch - but dinner time - it's all play mostly.    particularly with vegetables, he makes up stories with them....dances them around his plate, plays 'families' with them, builds 'towers' and cars etc with it.    he also has a' thing' for round food.    loves the feel of round food and will not eat meat unless it's minced or chopped into the tiniest pieces.we are at a loss as to what to do about both problems.    he is easily distracted when out and about - but when something interests him he fixes on it and you cannot distract him at all.    he's a fantastic mimic and has a great memory.    he's more advanced than his 4 and half year old brother with numbers, letters, arty stuff and he's trying hard to read.    he is very very intelligent and extremely polite - but has no sense of the 'regular'.    cannot get him to do a task - says 'no thank you, i dont like to do that'.any advice appreciated
2201,my six year old daughter took forever to potty train. she would pee in the potty right from the get go but it took three years to get her to not poop in her pants. it was so so so very frustrating. the all of the sudden when i had my other daughter in january this year she stopped going in her pants. she hadnt since then, but within the last two weeks she started doing it again. sometimes if she comes home from school with poop in her pants she says its because she doesnt like to wipe with toilet paper. at home she wipes with baby wipes. sometimes she says she didnt know that she pooped. i dont know if i believe her. could she really not know if she pooped and then not know that there was poop in her pants when i ask? i dont know why now she is doing it again. its very frustrating and i have no idea what to do. =( should i take her to the doctor?? please help =(
2202,hi.    i have a newborn and she's one month old.    she loves her bouncy seat and another little gadget from fisher price that we picked up but she refuses to sleep in her bassinet.    i have tried putting hr to sleep in one of the toys and then moving her to the bassinet but as soon as she goes in there she screams bloody murder.i have tried ignoring the screams for a while but as a new mother, it's very hard.does anyone have any suggestions?    i'm terrified that when it comes time for the crib, she will never accept it.    have i created a monster already at only 1 month?
2203,my 9 year old son has all of a sudden developed a problem urinating. of course we start by going to a doctor thinking possible uti. that test came back negative. so after alot of questions about school, friends, and inappropriate touching the doctor came to the conclusion that this was a behavorial issue. they feel that his bladder has been over-stretched for such a long period of time that it does not return to a normal size after urinating. as a mother i have watched for two days now as my sits on the toilet for hours at a time because he is overly concerned that he will have an accident. he cries not because of pain but he says that he always feels that he must urinate. as soon as he empties his bladder and stands up he feels that he must go again. can this really be a behavorial issue?
2204,i am currently 22 years old and have never had lice until last year. i went on a trip with a youth group i was in and came back itching. i thought maybe it was just my psoriasis acting up (i have scalp psoriasis), but after a few weeks i went to go get my hair cut and was told by the girl that i had lice. i was completely mortified! i slunk over to the drug store with my mom and got some nix. i followed the directions and did everything right but they kept coming back. it is now over a year later and have tried everything to get rid of them. i don't know where they are coming from! i have sprayed and vacuumed the bed, the couches, and my car. i am at my wits end! i feel like i want to shave my head but i can't because of the psoriasis. i can't seem to fight them. i called the doctor and got a prescription cream but i have to leave it on for 14 hours and i have school in the morning...what should i do?!?! please...i am begging you for help...anything!!!!

2208,my son is 16 months old and still cannot walk or talk. he has no words at all, but can stand if he is holding onto something. every doctor i see says something different. my son was born with torticollis so i always believed that his neck was effecting his abilty to sit and crawl. he finally began sitting at about 10 months. he has been slow is almost all areas, he didn't even get his first tooth until he was a year old.when he was one the doctor said my son was developmentally delayed. thay also siad his head was a lillte large, his teeth appeared a little pointed and his penis was slightly abnormal.do all these little anomilies add up to something else? what type of doctor should i see?i feel very alone in this situtaion. the doctors seem to be ignoring the fact that he cannot walk or talk at all. am i over reacting or could there be something seriously wrong?
2209,hello - i have a couple of questions re vitamins. i am a 33 year old woman (no children). i take the following vitamins: centrum multi, folic acid, calcium+d, (ocassionally b12), omega 3.is it necessary for me to take the extra folic acid? i was told that this will help with my reproductive cycle when i am ready to have children. also, when is the best time to take vitamins?i usually take them in the morning when i eat my breakfast.
2210,i have a 5 1/2 yr old son who can be very sweet at times but for reasons unknown he does not follow simple directions when asked to do something and has to be told 10-15 times within a five minute period to do what he was asked meaning daily routine tasks washing hands and face    getting dressed cleaning up his messes and constantly having to be told to eat during meal times. i have tried time outs taking privileges away (tv,toys etc..) at this point i am at a wits end i am running out of patience very quickly. do you have any suggestions????
2211,my three-year-old son throws a huge tantrums several times a day.    for instance, we are serving x for lunch, and he wants y, and we say he needs to have a few bites of x before we can have y, and he throws a huge tantrum. these tantrums have gone on as long as 1 1/2    hours, and they are making us miserable. he won't give in or budge; he's incredibly inflexible.and uncompromising. i know he's only three, but his 5-year-old brother has asperger's, so of course we worry that he might have a tinge of something. he also has separation anxiety at his preschool and doesn't want me to leave; he usually cries when i do go but then the teachers say later that he has had a good day.my questions are these: is this normal three-year-old behavior? will he become more flexible as he matures? how do we encourage greater flexibility? and how do we handle these tantrums? in general, we stick to our guns about what we've requested of him, and he sticks to his guns, so it becomes a monumental battle of wills.

2213,hello, i had a hysteroctmy june of 2006. i still have my ovaries. i started having some brown discharge about a year later assisted with some pretty intense pelvic pain. i had the hysteroctmy due to stage 4 endo and i also had pre cancer on my cervix. my question is...can i have endometriosis on my vaginal cuff or on my ovaries??? the pain feels just the same as it    did before the hysteroctmy and the discharge comes with it! please, if you have any insight on this for me it would be very helpful.thanks,rockinmom1
2214,a few years ago, i was referred to an endodontist for possible root canal, which she did and decided that although i'd had an infection, that this took care of it.    my dentist at the time after more x-rays, questioned this but i was not showing any more problems. recently, i have developed, a sore throat on the right side, my tongue on right side, underneath has an odd blister-like,    swelling and    on the right lower, the lymph gland is swollen. i am seeing another dentist, listed under    oral & maxilfocial surgery to have #'s 31 & 29 removed ( upper right back ) friday.    i have had this lymph swelling neumorus times in the last 10 years, under the care of 3 different dentists.now, my question, could this cause other, seemingly unrelated symptoms ?     i'm experiencing, a lot of stomach problems, diagnosed 6 yrs ago as ibs but more recently seeming to be worse---- a lot of burning in stomach and abdomen..& pain/aching in my spine.    my system seems to be very acidic and i am tired. i'm already diabetic and have fibro so its hard to determine if this infection ( as my dentist seems to think it is,) is causing these added problems.has anyone had certin conditions go from bad to worse, due to an infection of this type ?
2215,i have a 3 children one 5 one 3 and one 1.the problem we are faced with is with our 5yr old son. i'm not his real dad and his real dad has not seen him since he was 2yrs old. i've started the adoption process and i have sat down with him and explained everything to him and he understands a lot more than i thought he would.i think our problems started about 2 years ago when we moved away from the area we were brought up as kids and were my son was starting to get into things.it started with not doing as being told. then we put him into a play school and he seemed to have gotten worse from then on he was there for about 3 months when my partner and i pulled him out of it.this seemed to help for a week or so then he went back to telling lies stealing things from his brother not sharing toys sitting in a conner on his own and so the list goes on.we tried everything we could think of to get him out of it but with no luck. it just seemed to make him worse. if he had a good day we rewarded him for it but that was chucked back in our faces as soon as he got his reward.we tried the no tv no toys sitting on his bed shouting at him talking to him sitting in the conner watching other kids playing timeouts days out all of it with no affect on him.we thought he might start behaving a bit more when he started school last year but this seems to have made no change.at school and round other people  s houses he's as good as gold does as he's told we his told and uses his manners.i sat down with a few weeks ago and asked him why he is being like this and it took a good 3hrs before he started saying anything other than don't know um can't think etc.he said he wanted to live nearer to his grandma's and granddad  s. i took this on bored and spoke with my partner who is not too sure that this will change his way and is thinking of moving. i'm up for moving as i'm willing to give it a try but i have told him that in order for us to move he must first show me that he is going to behave. i have also explained that if we do move it will be me giving up my collage course of which i'm not even half way though and we can't just click our fingers and move threes a lot more to it than that.does anyone have any ideas of what we can do to get him to behave we are at our wits end with him.many thanks in advance russell.
2216,hi, i don't know if this is the right place to post this question since it's usually about children and teens but my parents are rude.    off the back rude to be honest.they tell me to move or do this right now! or say come here right now!and before i would use to just do whatever they say, but now i'm at my wits.    i'm ready to say enough is enough!    i want to get this problem over with.    i know, it's usually the parents dealing with this kind of stuff with their children but this time it's me that has to deal with my parents who are acting like children.sometimes i do say to them at the grocery store at the checkout if they say move this cart to that side now. and then i say excuse me to the cashier while i pull my mom or dad to the side and then i tell them that was very rude.    don't you dare try and say that to me again.    you think you can just say that to me in front of people like that?    no.    i need you to apologize right now please! and if they say no.    who do you think you're talking to? and then i say apologize right now please! and then if they say the same thing again i just go to the cashier and say i'm sorry, we don't need these groceries anymore.    do you mind putting them back? and then my parents become irate and then i pull them out of the store and then we all go home.    usually i would've spanked them for their behavior but that's usually at home because they did it to me before so i learned from them.    i don't do that anymore, because it's so rare that i would hit them thinking i would regret it after.so please help me deal with my parents.    i need them to be more respectful because at the moment i am like karma to them.    if they are mean to me i am mean to them, if they hit me i hit them harder, if they are nice to me, i'm nice to them.thanks :)derek

2220,hey i'm hannah and i'm 18.now before i start explaining i already know i am going to get plenty of lectures from worried adults but yes my parents know i cut and so does my therapist and everyone else who is important. i know i shouldn't do it and it's bad for me and leaves horrible scars for a temporary situation i'm completely aware and know the consequences for doing this but what i do need is advice. i can't stop. ive been to hospitals and recovery groups and all that jazz but we all know those things never really solve anything. i don't know why but when i feel like i'm losing control of a situation i cut. i take a razor to my thigh. ive been doing this since i was 13 and no it's not a cry for attention. no one knew until i was 16 when i told my parents i was going to kill myself. and from there i went to a mental hospital for a week.when i cut i feel like i'm in control of something for once and when it's over i feel a sense of..calmness. but a few minutes later when i look at the damage i did i feel like a big part of me has died. i want to stop but it's the only thing i have control over. my brother passed away 2 years ago. he was my best friend and also had depression like me. he always promised that everything would be okay and to be strong like him but when he got in that fatal car accident in 2010 we found out he over dosed on his depressions pills and passed out behind the wheel. we don't know if he just wanted a high, an accident or a suicide but my brother would never do anything to hurt anyone else and he was not suicidal in my mind. but whatever it was, was the result of him going 98 mph on a highway and hitting another car. it was never determined if he died of the od or the crash..both would have killed him and yes the person he hit is fine, he hit the back of her truck. after that, i felt like i don't know like the hope i had of being okay was gone.i think about it alot and just try to think of the awful scars i already have and how i don't want to make more. i guess my real question is, how do you express your emotions without hurting yourself? ive tried writing, running, reading and of course seeing a therapist. i don't want to cut anymore and i know my brother would not want me doing this.what can i do to get my emotions out in a healthy way?
2221,my son is 2. he does not listen to anything we say. he shouts alot. and when we disiplin him he just dosnt care. he goes it to a day dream alot. and he has also started shoutin in his sleep. he does this at least 4 times a nite.
2222,i have a (non identical) twin daughters (minna & misk) and they are in their 19th months old, both in a good healthy situation.sometimes minna, when she stares on any thing like (tv, picture, faces ...etc) she came with several fully (not the normal or if we name it over) eyes blinking 3-4 times according to the distance between her eyes and that thing, when she gets closer to the tv for example she came with 6-7 ones.usually we keep them away from the tv, about 3 meters minimum, she is very active, joyful and funny same as her twin sister.me and her mother really afraid because of this, also we don't have any one in both of our families with this case or even wearing eyeglasses.for your advice please.
2223,i am a manager of my community pool in my homes association.    normally these pools do not have a life guard on duty but have rules posted saying no children under 12 allowed without an adult swimmer, 18 or older).    other rules for safey are posted too: no food, alchohol, glass, animals in pool area.    no running etc.    you've all seen them if you have been in these pools.this is my first year as the manager and only day 4. we have 214 units in our hoa with about 25% of these now being rentals of absentee landlords.    most of these rentals turn over every year or two bring new families.just in the past 4 days i have seen very few adults at the pool with their children who are under 12.    trying to enforce this rule is almost impossible.please parents:    do not let you kids go to any pool without proper supervision. do not depend on other people to watch your kids.    we have tried issuing keys, but these kids are smart--they just open the gates from the inside.    we did try a pool watcher but they don't show up.    don't let your kids be the ones responsible for shutting down    great summertime entertainment for the whole area.    remind your kids that alcohol & swimming do not go good together.thanks for reading this.

2226,i have been married for 7 yrs and have a 16 yr old daughter from a previous relationship. for several years before i was married, we lived with my mom off/on.my husbands 12 yr old son lives with us too and we have a 3 yr old together. my husband is very strict on all of the kids. for the past three years, my daughter has been getting very angry about the rules and whenver she cant get her way, she calls her grandma and complains. my daughter is angry because we are strict and she wants to hang out with her friends and she even said that we were abusing her by not letting her have a social life....we told her that when she can be respectful, do her school work, chores and we meet her friends, then she can go out more. whenever my daughter calls my mom about something, my mother calls me and questions me about everything we do with the kids. my mom says that my husband has no right to discipline my daughter because he is not her father and i am choosing a man over my child.my husband gets angry because he says that i am not hard enough on my daughter and that i listen to my mother instead of him (which is not true)everyone had a huge blowup last week and there was all kinds of ugly things said and my daughter went to go stay with my mom. we agreed that we would go to family counseling.i told my daughter last night that she needed to come back to our home if we were going to work this out and she got very angry.    i told her that i was going to pick her up today so she can go home.my mother called me this morning angry,saying that my daughter was up all night crying and why i am making her go home if nothing has changed?    i am trying to tell them that nothing will change if she is not at home.my mom thinks she should stay there for a month or two until we have a lot of counseling and then she should go home.my husband is again mad, saying that i have no control over my daughter and if i do not show him that i have control, he does not want her to ever come back to our house.he even said that if my daughter doesnt come back today, that my 3 yr old can never see her sister or mother again and my mom babysits the baby while i work.i dont know what to do....
2227,my 7year old is fine until she goes to bed at night we send her around 7pm and she starts complaining of feeling sick and being hot and making every excuse possible even to the point that sometimes i think she makes herself sick on purpose. we have just had another baby and wonder if thats the problem. i dont know what to do. can anyone advise me?
2228,i have a 3 year old boy who will not go to bed. he will stay up till midnight or later till he finally passes out. once asleep he sleeps till about 7 am. he refuses to go to sleep in his own room even after we reads stories and try and make him as comfortable as possible. he just won't settle down and sleep. he is a very active little boy but doesn't eat regular meals all the time. he is more of a healthy snacker then a full meal eater. i need help to get my young boy to sleep. anyone have any suggestions?
2229,my 5 year old once again today spit on another child.    this has happened now 2 days in a row.    it also happened last week.    i have asked him why he did it and he says it's because the other children won't let him play or that it was his turn to talk.    we have talked about how to use our words instead of spitting.    today, i was very upset that it had happened again.    i have warned him twice that if he did it again that i would wash his mouth out with soap.    well, today i did as i said and followed through with the soap and put him in his room.    at first it didn't even phase him and then 10 or 15 minutes in the tears started.    he will start kindergarten next year and i'm sure they will not tolerate him spitting at school.    i'm not real sure how many more times my daycare will allow this behavior before they ask us to leave if it doesn't stop.    please give me some guidance as to what i should do to stop this behavior?
2230,my 8 year old niece went through a phase acting as if she were a dog.    she is now acting as a cat, putting snacks on a plate, a bowl of water on the floor and eats them as if she were a cat. she'll curl up in the corner and and lay as a cat would.    she also will do things and blame her 6 year old brother even though he was nowhere near what she did; she seems pre-occupied with boys at school; is sassy and also will purposely hurt her brother by scratching him or hitting him.    her grades are good.    am i right in suggesting my sister seek counseling for her?
2231,i has emergency surgery two weeks ago and had all of my colon and bowel removed. non reversible. can anyone who has had this done tell me if they had any normal bowel movements after surgery. i thought it would be impossible and the nurse said that you sometimes feel like you have to go but dont. i definately have had a couple of bowel movements and think this feels weird. nurse said could be as surgery was emergency i didnt get a bowel prep first. she didnt really convince me that it was normal though. any ideas?
2232,i had a question on phentermine cap 15mg . i am almost finished with my last month supply. my doctor said it was only good for 6 months then it loses it effectiveness. i'm afraid that if    i don't have an    appetite suppressant that i'll gain the weight that i have lost and worked at so far will come back. and i will be    twice as big or bigger and i watch what i eat and drink plenty of water. exercise 3x a day for 60 min. is there a another appetite suppressant that my doctor can give me to keep me from eating as much. i have had all the tests and nothing is wrong with me . i eat till i get full or usually don't eat at all . please help, any advice is welcome.
2233,i need some advice.    i have a 4 year old boy who loves to play with pirates and skeletons.    it was cute and fun at first, but now it is getting to be too much and i fear that is all he is thinking about.    most children i meet have a broad spectrum of what they enjoy but he is pretty stuck on this.    i've been reading books to him since he was born, when he was two i read a human body book and he was intregued by skeletons.    so i thought wow! my son must be    a doctor prodgey ( how dumb was i). so i think alot of this was my fault.    while i should have introduced many different things such as tomas the train, we were learning the human anatomy and crusing the halloween isles, because that was the only place they had skeletons.    while he learned alot of the atomical correct names, this fasination seems to have evolved to become gross.    i fear that the 2 years of this could have caused some mental damage because it was not age approprate.    so gradually i slowly threw alot of the halloween decor away and have been trying to introduce different things, but he is just not interested and seems to withdraw.    what should i do??    i had him in preschool last year, he made friends easily and was quite social.    his teacher said that all the pictures he drew were of skeletons.    she said that we was a good student and listened well.    am i just being weird?    what can i do to help introduce things in an easier fashion?    did i cause irreversible damage?        please help....
2234,i have a 5 year old with severe autism, he was diagnosed 2 and a half years ago.for the past year and a half i have noticed my other son who is 3, turning 4 in a couple of months is not developing as expected.everytime i give him food to eat he will throw it or smear it into the floors and walls, each time he does this i remove the food from him and give him 3 minutes time out, i have been doing this for 12 months with no result, he is also very agressive, he constantly hits and bite me or throws things at me, again he gets 3 minutes time out each time but it doesnt make a difference. he attacks his teachers at school, he is not interested at all in being potty trained, he smears his stools from his underpants all over my walls and floors.he is constantly on the go from 4am until 8pm, he doesn't sit down for a second, and if he does he has to mess with something or someone.even if i take him out for a treat he will climb all over the place. he also seems to have no sense of danger even after hurting himself numerous time doing the same things. he also doesn't take any instruction from anyone, at school or from me. when you talk to him it just goes right through him, he hs had hearing and sight checked and they are fine.the health visitor has referred his to a child development centre after seeing his behaviour at the 3 year check up, she told me i am doing everything right with him, like praising every little good thing he does, ignoring some behaviours and using the time out disipline.i am at a dead end, i am so physically tired and mentally drained with trying he isn't interested in any toys either, he only ever wants to play with toilet rolls.my house is a mess as every day he breaks something, he has just pushed my brand new tv off the table today, smashed 6 eggs on the floor earlier on. it is like this everyday. what could possibly be wrong with him? any ideas? his speech is fine and so is his eye contact.
2235,my daughter is 2 years old and socially she is not nice she bites, she hits, she throws temper tantrums, she kicks, and when she is around other children ar adults she just normally cries.this discussion is related toagressive two year old.
2236,hi this isn't really about a hysterectomy... but i couldn't find a related category. i currently am having pain in my vagina. ive had a yeast infeciton before and i don't think this is one. there is no white discahrgy stuff but it's really red and irritated. it burns to pee and it's uncomfortable. it kinda hurts and i tried having sex and it hurt.it all started after my last pack of birth contorl pills. i normally on my pill have a 3 day period. this past month i was still bleeding when i had to start my new pack of pills so i bleed for 7 days +. anyway, i didn't think anything of it and took a minocylin pill i use for acne and ever since i've been having these issues. i am 100% positive it isn't an std. so is it still a yeast infection just without the white **** or just horribly irritated or what? also how can i make it stop!?!
2237,i am a 50 y/o female who underwent total laparascopic hysterectomy with removal of ovaries on 5/26/09.    i had fast growing polyps and anemia.    i have a history of stage 3 breast cancer that was 8 cm and had 21 lymph nodes removed with cancer cells in 1/3 of one node.    i was/am estrogen receptor positive.    i was on tamoxifen for five years and had side effects of increase in size of endometrial lining (11 instead of 3) and growth of polyps that protruded from cervix.    i have had, even prior to hysterectomy, some nights i am so hot and wake up wet all over.    i don't believe i've ever had a hot flash, and definately not while on tamoxifen.    i don't know what all this info will mean for any hormones for me.    i had, and desire to have after recuperation, a lovely sex drive and life, though some dryness had occurred in the past year.    i'm a bit concerned about all this after reading posts.    i take no supplements of any kind, or had not.    right now i am on a serrous glutenate pill for my anemia.    i believe my healing is on pointe in that i am decreasing pain pills and moving fairly well with help from others, not lifting or pushing anything.    i had no risk factors for the breast cancer other than being overweight.    any input, insight, would be welcome.    thank you.    anchor76

2243,i was born with a bilateral cleft lip.    they were repaired long ago, but i am not satisfied with my lip; it is very thin and flat.    i am considering fat injections, but i am concerned that my lip may not respond to the procedure like a normal lip would.    is there any information on adults with repaired cleft lips having fat injections and what the outcomes are?
2244,my daughter just turned 6 and in the last few months we have been noticing some behavioral issues that are very concerning.    it almost seemed as though she couldn't distinguish between reality and imagination, wondering if what she thought of may have actually happened.    an example of this, she would say i don't know if i picked up that baby referring to a stranger at the store, or i don't know if i drank that water referring to the water that had gathered in a rotted out pumpkin.    very outlandish comments, but she really wasn't sure if it had happened or not.    in the last month or so she started saying she couldn't remember things she just did, such as brushing her teeth, or wiping or finishing her meal.    she will go up to brush her teeth and i will see her brushing, but she is confused after and doesn't know if she actually did it.her teacher hasn't noticed anything as severe as this at school, but she did say that my daughter zones out at school at least few times a week, to where she will have to pull her back in to get her focusing again.    i mentioned this to her ped. and she wants to follow up in a few weeks and suggested ordering thyroid tests or possibly a mental evaluation.    it has been very scary to watch some of these behaviors and i am hoping that it is just a phase.    just hoping i might be able to get some advice until then, because i haven't been able to find much about this online.
2245,ok i have a son who will be 2 in dec. and he has been sleeping through the night for awhile now and all of a sudden he has been waking up everynight screaming at the top of his lungs. at first i thought it might be night terrors but he is awake and standing up in his crib. now i have a very different situation he sleeps in the same room as my husband and i and his 9 month old baby brother. we live with my sister and her husband in their small 2 bedroom house because we can not afford our own place, anyway he wakes up his brother in these fits he throws and i am expecting another baby in march and would like to get him out of this if it is possible. if anyone knows of anything that would maybe help please let me know!

2248,in case you missed it, the fda cited a food processing plant in yakima, washington called snokist for moldy applesauce.    this company is a food supplier for the government school lunch programs.    an article i just read had even more deplorable description of the facility than what was reported in the nightly news.    absolutely disgusting the descriptions i read about the condition the facility has been in while it is processing this stuff as food that goes across the entire country.    i'm shocked that i am not reading anything about recalls of this food.    i don't care how hot the vats are that the applesauce get, i'm not interested in eating something that they skim the mold off of and get away with calling it food.    i have enough food sensitivities without aggravating the problems by allowing toxic mold to get cooked into the apple sauce--along with reading about the conditions i read in the article i will post the link to shortly.if any of us were to make our own homemade apple sauce, we would never use apples that were obviously moldy.    we would have the good sense to throw out the apples that were so unfit for consumption, because we know it isn't safe.    we would use the freshest and cleanest fruit we had on hand.i just thought it was too important not to alert other people of this serious issue in the food supply.    this isn't right to do, because that mold can't be good for anyone who already has compromised health, even if it is supposedly killed     by the cooking process.    plus, it would obviously change the flavor.    i'm definitely throwing out anything with that company name and any canned apple sauce with a not so well known brand name.    supposedly none of it reached any food banks or schools, but how can they really be so sure, since the company was cited more than once in recent months and didn't really change its practices once the health inspectors went on their way and had their backs turned.    i won't be leaving the stuff i'm throwing out for anyone else to take for themselves, because i can't be sure it's safe.    this company has lost all points with me.    this is absolutely appalling to me.http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/fda-company-sent-moldy-applesauce-to-school-lunch-program/

2251,hello,     i had one ovary and the uterus removed june 06.    no menopuase symptoms.    the last ovary removed on feb 5, 2008. no menopause symptoms.     suddenly this year, sometime in april 09 - i began getting what i thought were hot flashes.        here and there, then lately 11 - 13 times a day.    is this possible to happen sooooo long after the final removal of my last ovary feb 2008?    thank you!
2252,we have just read 10 year with sleeping problem not being able to sleep by themselves.    our 10 year old daughter will go to bed fine (at approx 8.00pm) just recently she has began coming out to us crying saying i'm frighten/scared,    the problem intensifies when we go to bed (leaving her night light on), she will come up to us crying (in a state) and will not return to bed without someone with her, once taken back to bed she will return shortly after in the same state.    making her return to bed herself only makes matter worse.    she is an avid reader and has recently read a book that she is now saying has scared her and she is frighten in her bedroom.    she will not discuss the book or her fears, but will play quite happily in her bedroom during the day.    she has always been frighten of the dark.    could you please offer some suggestions or advise, we have tried speaking with her about this problem but no luck so far.

2254,my son has had penis foreskin which doesn't stretch back, leading to itchiness and redness for the last three years. i find that now he often fondles and plays with his penis. is it mainly because of his itchiness or he finds pleasure in doing so? when confronted he says that he finds nice feeling in doing so. please advise?thanks,
2255,in the last year or so, my nephew has demonstrated behavior that has raised suspicion of sexual abuse or inappropriate touching in the past.    he has been to a counselor and social services have met with him, but no solid conclusion was ever reached.    recently, he visited his maternal grandmother's house (with the mother) and upon returning, he intentionally peed in his bedroom.    i've just learned that this is the 2nd or 3rd time that he has done this and all after having visited at his grandmother's.    (please note that this is the residence at which any suspected abuse would've taken place, as it is where he lived the first 3 or 4 years of his life.)    when the grandmother is approached about his behavior, she says that it's probably because he doesn't get enough attention at home.    we are at a loss... there just seems to be too much of a connection between his behavior and its timing for the two not to be related.    what is driving this behavior?i'm not sure what other information you would need in order to accurately make an assessment, but i'm assuming that it may be helpful to know that he is 5 years old and has a 1 year old half-brother.any insight you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.    thank you!
2256,i am scheduled to have a tah bso in approx 4 weeks and was told that due to the degree of anatomical shift related to the size of the uterus and cystic ovaries ureteral stents will be used to demarcate the bladder structures to help prevent unintended damage. has anyone experienced this and how will it add to the post op period? very much intolerant of pain and nausea. have previously had 2 c-sects and can relate to the post op period, but the stenting adds a new dimension. if there is anyone who has had this coupled with the tah? when were your stents placed? have also had epigastric pain after eating meals. have been told that the pain is from the food passage being compromised and creating a reflux picture, all due to uterine size. has anyone experienced this? any suggestions? again do not like pain and nausea.
2257,its a method of 'reading' the bodies meridians via energy channel points that correlate to the acupuncture points with modern electronic technology..yea, sound weird. i know someone that swears by it, to see what is going on in the whole body. now i am a 'facts' kind of guy, not into smoke and mirrors. so i will ask, has anyone here had this done.?since i do know partially what conditions i have, if i do this part of my believe will be how curate it is in pointing out what i already know about myself. the whole deal, including the after appt is under $300.
2258,my 5yr old son has become extremely emotional, angry and some time aggressive since start yr 1 at school. he is fine when visiting with other people (friends and family) but as soon as i turn up his behavior changes dramatically. i am struggling to cope with how he has changed and his anger towards me. he cries at everything, he is in tears at least 5 times a day, he shouts at me and on occasion lashes out too. he is an extremely affectionate boy usually, and i praise him for good behavior and tell him i love him several times a day. i need help with what to do to help him through this as he then gets upset about his outbursts saying ' i cannot help it mummy, i am turning into a naughty boy and i don't know why' and ' i cannot stop it mummy' this is breaking my heart! help please
2259,i have an 8 yr old boy who goes to third grade and is doing very well.he knows how to skate, swim, is in yellow belt karate, reads at level grade 5!only thing is we have to be behind him so he bruahes his teeth, ties his laces properly, sits well on the table and other things we have repeated millions of times!my husband thinks he has a learning disability because of this! but isnt it normal to be behind your child for certain things? should i bring him to the dr to see if he has a concentration issue or is it normal for an 8 yr old boy to forget stuff even if we repeat!?what can i do to help him?
2260,i see my gynecologist this thursday for my 6 week post op check up.    what should i expect with that visit?    better yet, what should i expect, you know, life post hysterectomy?i had a unilateral oophorectomy last december.    no problem.    i hadn't had a period from the month prior to that surgery through the following month.    february's period was one that i hardly knew i was having one.march through june, my periods were beyond out of control.    heavy bleeding, major cramps.    the cramps were bad enough that i was lying on my bed curled up in a fetal position.    in june, my gyn put me on provera, which did very little for me.    slightly less bleeding.in july, i went back to the gyn.    he told me that under no circumstance would he accept any argument about my having a lavh.    i had that done september 8th.    i was introduced to hrt that same evening after my surgery.i'm currently using a estrogen transdermal patch.    i'm finding that only 1 out of a package of 4 actually stick to my skin.    no, i'm not doing anything different with the other 3.    it's frustrating!    although, i do have to admit that the hot flash thing isn't as bad as it was about 4 weeks ago.    i guess that's something to get excited about!    *smile*i've been having some slight discomfort around my belly button, in the area (both sides) of where my mons pubis attaches to my groin.    has anyone else had this kind of discomfort?    or am i just going coo coo?i know this is long winded.    i just have so many questions about the hysterectomy and the surgery induced menopause thing.    i don't know what to really expect.
2261,i am a 50 year old woman. i have always had a normal sexual life, however the last few years i cant have sex anymore it hurts to bad i feel like i am being ripped apart, my husband is getting really angry with me but the pain is to much for me to handle i dont have any medical insurance so i cant go to a doctor. if anyone can help me please do i am lonely upset and need help.....
2262,ok, so i am 20 years old and i have been smoking for almost six months now. progressively, i began to smoke more and more out of control until recently i began waking up with terrible nausea and the hersey squirts.    i understand that what i was doing was irresponsible, i was using to help avoid depression symptoms and allowed myself to make a habit out of something i was trying to use in a medicinal way.    i ended up in the er so terribly dehydrated that my blood was like diesel.    i ended up getting 4000 cc's of fluid intravenously due to the fact that i couldn't even drink water.    i am ashamed to say that essentially i let myself get so high all the time to the point i was starving myself of water and nutrition.    at this point i will say this: if you smoke weed make darn sure you are caring for yourself. you would be surprised at how much you may or may not be treating yourself as i did so please learn from my stupidity.    at this point, i'm stuck with this decision:    do i smoke now while i'm still feeling a little ill just to feel a little better and induce slight appetite?    or should i try to cold turkey it for awhile, which is leaving me so very hungry?    any help from people with experience with this issue will be more than appreciated.
2263,my grandson was born very early weighing only 2lbs. 9oz.    he had complications but came through them but stayed in the hospital for 2 months.    he is a very bright and creative child.    he is also very quiet and shy and spends a lot of time alone.    he does very well in school and is even in some talented and gifted classes.    my concern is that he throws fits at school and now is throwing fits on a regular basis.    if he cannot do something perfect he gets very angry.    i had him twice in the last month and was shocked at the fits that he was throwing.    i did even pop him once because he threw a toy down and caught me off guard and i just reacted.    normally i do not spank my grandkids.    also, he is so disrespectful to me and really won't even talk to me.    i sometimes have to ask him a question several times before he will answer me and his answers are very monotone and rude.    he gets so angry playing video games that he will begin to cry his frustration level gets so high.    i am pretty sure that his dad acts this way to him and this is where he is learning this behavior.    i am worried about my grandson.    i try to talk to my son about his behavior but he says he knows he needs to change but he doesn't think he can.    i have to be very careful because i know if i say too much i will probably get told to mind my own business.    i am so worried about my grandson, he is way too young too be so angry, i have never seen a 7 year old behave this way.    i know you can't tell me what to do but possibly some suggestions.    i would appreciate it.
2264,so this is my first 3 year old, but i am beside myself.    he is almost 4 years old and i seriously don't know what to do with him.    he is so grouchy and can be just mean to other kids.    he gets so mean and nasty when he thinks that someone is being mean to him or doesn't do what he wants.    i took him to a b-day party tonight and he was playing and then all the sudden i looked at him and he was arguing with a little girl and giving her death looks.    this usually happens the places i take him.    my husband thinks it is normal, but i don't.    he wants to play with other kids, but then has a hard time doing it.    it broke my heart tonight when he came over and said, noone wants to play with me.    but honestly, if he was being nasty to them, i don't blame them.    i have had so many talks with him about being nice to others and i don't know what else to say.    he often thinks he is being funny by making up little phrases and saying them to other kids, your a bubblegum head.    i know that he is just trying to be funny, but other kids don't usually think so and then they are turned off by being around him.    i have also tried to talk to him about this.    he is not a good sharer either.    if there is a toy that he wants, he will not share it, no matter who asks him.    i want him to have friends, but he is making it difficult for others to like him.    is this normal?    it doesn't seem like other kids are acting this way.    many of the kids at the b-day party were playing together and having fun.    we take him places that he is around other kids.    he goes to school 2 times a week, i have friends who have kids his age he plays with, we have signed him up for different classes with kids his age.    i just need feedback.    thank you.
2265,my daughter is six. she is a middle child, two older brothers (12 and 9) and one younger (5). she is very grown up which, for the most part, i am grateful. she can clean her room, takes her own baths/brushes her own teeth/gets herself dressed, etc... she does very well in school. her teacher says she is very bright and she rarely needs help on homework. 95% of the time she is the perfect child...but there is that 5% of the time that makes me nuts. she talks back. not in an ugly way but like tonight i told her to go to bed and she said that her older brothers aren't in bed yet. or if i ask her to take something back to her room or whatever she will point out that so and so has something in there that they aren't taking back. we were leaving my mom's tonight and all four kids were acting like clowns. i said stop jumping and screaming. you all are acting like two year olds. she walked off and i heard her say two year olds can't talk. i just really wanted to spank her for that smartmouth! but i've tried that and it does no good. she also whines a lot and cries every morning when it's time to get up and get ready. she has started many a day with a spanking for turning her tv on and standing in front of it when she is supposed to be getting dressed or for laying back down when she is supposed to go eat breakfast. to make it worse she tattles on my to her father when i spank her and he gets mad at me. he is very hard on the boys but rarely punishes her. last week she rubbed her fingers on her bottom and then waved her hand in her 9 yo brother's face. her dad thought this was funny. i had to be the heavy and punish her for it.
2266,hi all,my friend who is 60 has experienced vaginal bleeding. she went to the doctor and the doctor who did a scan of the womb first of all said there is a thickening of the linking of the womb but that he doesn't think it's cancer (he showed her all the scan pictures too), but he has referred her for a d and c (she has to have a general). she is very over weight.bit worried that he didn't think it was cancer yet has referred her for more tests. if he thought it wasn't then why would he refer her for more tests?any ideas? if the doctor doesn't think it's cancer, are they normally right, do they normally have a good idea by looking at scans?thank you in advance.
2267,hello!    last december (2006) i had a lavh.    i didn't have sex for a few months afterwards, but now, still to this day, sex is nearly intolerable.    anyone else have this issue?
2268,i'm nervous about having this done. my appt is aug 17th. can you let me know a little more of what to expect? when will i really be able to drive. do you really wake up after surgery and all you can do is yell and moan for the first day? is it that much worse than having babies? any info...people that have had it done that want to talk or from the professional view. i'd like info , please. thank you, martha
2269,my daughter has always been a picky although healthy eater, but she has begun holding all foods in her mouth and cheeks until it is liquified, and/or chews her food into tiny pieces before swallowing. she barely ate one of her favorite foods (sesame chicken) saying it was too crunchy or hard. we have tried ignoring it, as well as talking to her about it, but it seems to be getting worse. she is losing weight now, and was pretty slim to begin with. we thought it was sort of a game to her at first but it seems to be more of an issue that she has no desire to change now. any ideas as to what is causing this or how to stop it?
2270,my daughter is exactly the same.... ive cried and cried.... i tried the 123 magic with no hope.... ive done everything... i thought maybe it was because she was the 2nd child, but she gets the same attention i showed my first child..... i hope this passes....she is allergic to mold, dust mites, and sugar....she just started kindergarden (so no naps any more) and we moved.... but she was doing the temper thing in our old home too.... so it cant be the move... it might be sugar??this discussion is related totemper tantrums from 5 1/2 year old girl with typically sweet disposition.
2271,hello, i just have a question pertaining to my gf and her 14 year old son. she has been a single mom for half of her son's life and then got married when the boy was at age seven (her ex-husband was not his biological father). obviously she has now gotten a divorce and we met early on in her seperation from her ex-husband (alittle over a year ago). i have noticed that on occassion her 14 year old boy sleeps with her whenever i'm not there (i work nights four days out of a week) and recently - in the last week or two - this behavior has somewhat increased. he has slept with her probably three or four nights that i haven't been there over that time frame. i feel uncomfortable with that situation occurring, mainly because of the child's age but also because neither one of them (especially my gf) seem uncomfortable with it. furthering more background to this is the fact that the boy is more sexualized for his age then some other kids that i know in his age group. also in her previous relationship with her ex-husband, the boy would try and sleep together with them and be forced by the ex-husband to sleep on the floor in their bedroom, right up until the boy was roughly 12-13 years old, when finally he slept in his own room. finally, my gf did confide in me that one night last summer, he did enter her (our) room and tried to imitate me while she was sleeping - talking in a low voice, calling her by her name rather than as just mom and some other things that i did find disturbing. i feel that i'm not over-reacting to this and i haven't brought it up with her yet, but feel that maybe alittle honest feedback would help me before i decide on what my next action should or shouldn't be.
2272,i feel like i am out of options when it comes to disciplining and working on behavioral issues with my almost 4 year old boy. we have tried a variety of methods and none seem to work. i read a lot of information on behavior issues and discipline but the standard line is to be consistent. we are consistent. we do not back down from the rules and he always gets caught and has to go through punishment, but it does not seem to make a difference. the biggest issue is that there seems to be a major control issue that goes on, but i don't know if there is more to it. it started out with tantrums. besides the normal ones at home, once he seemed to realize he couldn't get away with them there he would wait until we were out in public and then try to do whatever he wanted. this was about a year ago. he would try to sit up in the cart and stand and i would tell him to sit down. he would look around and then right at me and smile and slowly stick his foot back up to stand. when i would get him out he would start to scream and throw a fit. so every time we went out in public this would happen in some form so we would take him to the car and he would have to sit in there until he screamed it out. eventually this stopped, but he just moved on to something else. the next thing became playing in bed. he shares a room with his brother and they have bunk beds. well, he would play in bed for hours. he would grab onto the bars from the bed above and swing on them. jump around, etc. we have a video monitor so we would catch him every time. he would go to time out and lose privileges. this lasted around two months an then he transferred his behavior to preschool. first it was running away from the teacher and laughing and not doing what she would say. oh, he also has an issue with women. he does not listen or obey as well as he does with men. then it was water. he also has an issue with this. an obsession about water and if allowed he will drink and drink and not stop causing him to pee himself continually. so then he tried to sneak water all the time. then when that stopped he started intentionally peeing himself. he would stand up in the middle of circle time, spread his legs and pee in front of everyone and he is fully potty trained. this went on for a few months. then school ended and now the peeing has stopped but he has started to throw fits in time out and in public. he doesn't throw himself on the ground    anymore, but whines and cries for hours especially in public when he doesn't get his way and he has been playing in bed again. he just seems to move through various issues after each ones eventually doesn't work after months of trying it. we give time outs, take away toys, lost privileges. he doesn't get to do certain things when his brother does when he has been bad. we have a chart with stickers and if they get a certain amount they get a piece of candy and if more a toy. he doesn't care about this. he shows off his x's to people instead of the stickers. we thought he might like the negative attention so we try ignoring him. still has consequences like time out but he gets ignored in time out and then has to play by himself instead of getting attention. nothing works. he doesn't seem to care. he just keeps doing it. i have no idea what to do and it is frustrating that everything we try seems to no avail and reading advice never seems to help as it is already what we do. any suggestions?
2273,i nanny for a family with three kids.    9,7, and 4.    the four year old is a girl and has just this week started acting strange.    on monday she went potty and was in there forever.    she was being really private about it all and was shutting me out completely.    she flushed but for at least 20 minutes, if not more, she kept wiping and wiping.    her mother told me this was not too strange as she has done this before but after she finished she refused to put underwear on.    she wouldn't tell me why and she also refused pants.    she went around with just a shirt on the rest of the day.the next day i went to the house in the morning and for almost 2 hours the mom fought with her about having to wear underwear.    she cried and cried, i don't want to wear underwear!    she also will not wear pants.    since tuesday she understands she must wear underwear, but she will not wear pants.    her mom and i have to dress her in only dresses, which is getting tricky with the weather getting colder and colder.i have noticed in the past week or so that she also always has her hand in her panties and wants a lot more private time.    she has started wanting to be in her room alone and wants me to go outside so she can stay alone inside.    yesterday, i went outside to play with her siblings and when i came back in to check on her, she had her hand in her panties again.she has also started to freak out when i tell her that we need to go somewhere (school, to get her siblings, dance, etc).    today when i put her in her carseat she freaked out when i tried to buckle it saying, i don't want it buckled!    i told her i had to and convinced her to do so.    right when i placed her in the carseat, she put her hand in her panties.    i'm worried it's a new habit or some kind of coping mechanism for anxiety she is having.    and i wonder if the reason she didn't want the seat buckled was due to not being able to put her hand in her panties.i am at such a loss for what to do, as is everyone close to her.    i want so badly to understand so i can help her, but i am helpless.
2274,my grand-daughter has just today turned 10.    her mom and dad are divorced, but on fairly good terms.    my son is remarried to a girl whom the kids love.    lately my 10 year old granddaughter does not want to go to her dad's.    she goes into her bedroom and stays there, she will not eat (even her birthday cake).    she has been lying , and text messaging four letter words to her friends.she also has bouts of diarrhea when she comes to my son's.    jusy last year she wanted to comelive with her dad and his new wife permanently.    he told her that he would love that, but she must discuss it first of all with her mom.    now, she doesn't even want to come when it's his weekend to have them.    they (my son and his wife) have an 18 month old son, whom both the girls love very much, but lately the one granddaughter doesn't even bother with him.her mother is very manipulative, and i am wondering if this could be caused by something that is going on in her mothers home.    her mother works nights, and her stepdad takes care of both the girls.    he is very good to them.i have a bi-polar condition and my son used to suffer from anxiety.    could any of this be influencing my granddaughter.we love her so much, and so desperately need advice and guidance.any help will be appreciated.thank you
2275,please help!hi there i have a 3 year old son with down's syndrome. he is adorable but sometimes his behaviour becomes very difficult to manage. he refuses to eat at the table with the family and if he is left to sit with with us he will escalate into a full blown tantrum ie: bang his head try to throw himself off the chair, scream inconsolably and become aggressive. he doesn't calm down and can behave like this for up to 2 hours. he will sometimes only eat if i distract him with toys or the tv. he bites, scratches, pulls hair and slaps when he is angry. normally these episodes happen several times a day but he does have good and bad patches where sometimes it's worse, sometimes it's better. a few days ago he got into a temper because i tried to feed him his breakfast. he hit his face on the floor so hard he made his nose bleed. i'm really struggling to cope.can anyone suggest anything or offer any advice? could it be possible that he also has autistic spectrum disorder. i can't get any medical professional to take my concerns seriously. some of them have suggested i am being an over anxious mother, but when he is seen he is mostly happy and contented. they don't see the other side of him.many thanks sarah
2276,my 3 1/2 year old daughter has been having daily inconsolable tantrums for approximately 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the past 2 weeks.    recently my wife went back to work and we put our children into daycare.    the daycare staff advises us that my daughter does great and when i arrive to pick her up she seems to be happy and having a good time.    however, when we get home she become increasingly agitated until she finally has a tantrum and then she just can't seem to recover.    we have tried focusing her attention on other things and timeouts but nothing seems to calm her down.    the last two days i have put her in the bath early and it seems to calm the tantrum.    does anyone have any suggestions or advise?
2277,i want to get some people  s opinions. this month i think my dh and i have finally gotten the deed done. but of course i am still waiting to be able to take a hpt. i am on   3dpo   from my ovulation tracker but i  m 11 days from my first positive opk (i  ve had 8 positive opk  s in a row) and its day 33 on my cycle. now, i can  t really say how regular i am because i have pcos and i am normally on clomid plus this is my third cycle since my m/c back in july and the first time for my dh and i to ttc. so i was thinking about taking my prometrium. i  m thinking of doing this because; i believe i  ve m/c because of my progesterone levels were very low in the beginning and i was put on to prometrium but i think i started it too late. and if i  m not pregnant then it will induce my period and i can start my first round of clomid again. does this sound feasible?
2278,occasionally, my 15 month old son has hand tremors, which concern me.    the hand shaking is usually right after a nap, where he is still a little sleepy.    the tremors last anywhere from 1-3 minutes, that i see.    i first noticed them when he was as young as 10 months old.    i have touched his hand to stop them and when i release his hand they continue.    this is not a daily occurrence.    is this something to be worried about?
2279,hello everybody. i was hoping to get some advice/feedback on a particular topic. my step-daughter has been with me and my husband for 2 days and she's going home today. during the entire time the tv has been on, and she always throws a fit when we turn it off. i am getting concerned for her, because she does look a bit overweight, and has a pretty bad attitude. on top of that, her language skills are low, and most of the time babbles. it sometimes takes us a few minutes to figure out what she's saying. she's almost 4, and will be going to school in september.is this caused by her always having the tv on, or are there other causes such as how she's raised at home (she lives with her mother, and i'm not sure on how she treats her and disciplines her). does anybody have any suggestions on how to sort of fix her attitude and behavior? it's getting to the point that i don't want to be around when she's here because she only causes trouble, and never listens. i know kids are like that, but this is a bit extreme.thanks in advance for any advice.
2280,my daughter is in a shared parenting situation, her childs dad lives with his parents, they are in a dirty court battle over school issues since he is starting kindergarten, the mother hada day off on tuesday, (the child normally would ride bus), but the child spent his normal monday at his dads, who does not live in the school district, she told the father monday evening, since she was off that she would pick up the child at 7 to get him home in time to catch the bus, which is at 7:35. i, the maternal grandmother went with her and the paternal grandfather (after waiting for 10 min) came to the door and said we are not giving him to you,,its not happening and then slamed the door in her face. i wittenested the whole thing. last evening, thursday, when the child was at his home with his mom, he told her, papa did not slam door, please dont be mean to my other papa. now, i ask you, doesnt that sound like someone is teaching or coorosing this child to either lie, or actually smooth over the truth??? is this acceptable behavior??? please help us.
2281,my 13 year old son with add is having a horrible year with teachers who don't know how to work with him at all.    he is constantly loosing assignments, teachers score his work lower than it should be (i have math tests to prove it), he has been in suspension more times than i think are warranted for arguing with a teacher.    they want all children to do exactly what they are told exactly when they are told to do it.    my son doesn't transition well between classes.    they want him out of honors - which i feel if he gets out of honors he will be more distracted in the other class. he refuses all medications and i will not force medications on him.    i am at my wits end in dealing with the school.    my kid has a 504 plan.    i have sought the help of the 504 coordinator & administrators but no results. special ed isn't an option since he doesn't meet the state criteria for qualifying. i want to pull him out since i know the way the teachers don't know how to work with him and i personally feel like they don't care either.    what am i to do?    the kicker is i work full-time so homeschooling is out. i would love to do the private school thing - but in this area they are all religious schools with doctrines that we really don't believe personally - besides i don't know if they would do any better. i would love to hear from anyone that has been in a similar situation how it turned out both good and bad since we can learn from each other.
2282,how smart is your right foot?you have to try this , it takes 2 seconds.this will boggle your mind and you will keep you trying over and over again to see if you can outsmart your foot, but, you can't.it's pre-programmed in your brain!1. without anyone watching you (they will think you are goofy......) and while sitting at your desk in front of your computer, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.2. now, while doing this, draw the number '6' in the air with your right hand. your foot will change direction.i told you so!    and there's nothing you can do about it! you and i both know how stupid it is, but before the day is done you are going to try it again, if you've not already done so.
2283,when i was younger i got hit in my eye on accident,i suddenly got a reddish/brown freckle in my eye and now i'm 18 and i still have it. it has never bothered me, i can see perfectly fine. but, now i'm looking into getting it removed, but i'm not sure if it's possible? and if it so, about how much would it cost?
2284,i don't know why but over the last year i've been getting dizzy when hungry, but not of the norm. like, lets take christmas day for example. i mean, who really eats on christmas morning when there are presents waiting? it had only been an hour after waking and i felt like i was gonna pass out. my brothers say that they can't eat breakfast, it makes them feel like throwing up. but, i'm the other way around! is it normal? is it a blood sugar thing perhaps? or, am i just a chunkamuffin' that needs to shrink her belly? =)
2285,i have a son who love to irritate, do the opposite of what you say, argumentative, speak then thinks, he gets in trouble alot at school for this behavior on the other hand he is very intelligent, he will be taking ap courses next year in middle school, gets commended on taks, loves to read, reads about history, he is a very big boy 5'3 125lbs. he gets in trouble quite a bit and knows he shouldn't have done it, but he is quick to react. i have to be a drill sargent and so does his dad, it's quite irritating. does anyone know what i am talking about, could anyone give me some kind of advice or reassurance that this is a boy or something that can be done. any help would be great:)

2287,i have an 18 month old son who recovered from the stomach flu about one week ago.    for the past 3 nights, he wakes up 2 hours after we put him to bed, and vomits up his whole dinner.    he is otherwise fine, no diarrhea, no fever, normal during the day.    he is not on any medications, and he has been drinking milk fine up until this point.    is it possible to develop an intolerance to milk?    anyone have any insight as to what could be causing this?    thanks.
2288,hi, i am a 52 year old woman who was always suspected of hypothroidism. i have always had a weight problem but, because i always ate healthy, no sugar, no salt mostly veggies and salads. never was a meat eatter, always had to eat several egg whites a day for protein.doctors really need to look further than at a persons body size in considering what is wrong. not all heavy people eat alot or improperly. and    heavy people obviously can have hyperthyroidism. under-treated or untreated hyperthyroidism is bad. for years i have had many symptoms of thyroid probs, both hypo and hyper. eyes bulging out of head, extreme fatigue alternating with hyperacvtivity,brittle hair(used to have such good hair salons never wanted to cut it), heart palpitations,dry eyes, constant fainting, have not had to tweeze eyebrows in 10 years, barely any hair on legs and underarms, insomnia and etc. i have always had very low blood pressure and was recently told it was too low,, low sugar(glucose),;ow cholesterol, all indicative of how i eat , not what was assumed because of my size and rapid weight gain weekly. i went to doctor and told him my symptoms, at first he giggled and said by looking at you i know you do not have hyperthyroids.how rude and condascending, once again i was just a fat person who all of my problems were that i was fat, not thinking for once the weight was a symptom, not a cause. as you can see i am angry, sorry. i dieted, went to a    nutritionist, etc.    etc. i continued to gain weight, but there were periods as well that i was hungier, eatting more, eyes bulging, heart palpitations, extreme mood swings and very hyper, not sleeping, but losing eight. i gave in, figured i needed a psychiatrist, went that route, was not it,my eight went to a whopping 378 pounds with extreme rapid gain, i could not take it anymore, i decided to get baritric surgery. once again i was prepping for surgery and my thyroid test was bad, indicative of hyperthyroidism.i was informed to go to my pcp, i did, once again another doctor said no way    i should be skinny therefore it is not right. i went ahead with the surgery and have since lost 110 pounds and am 20,000.00 poorer. i had several more lab tests done since and thyroid got worse after each time.i am now going to another doctor an endocrimologist, they think i have and am going between hypo and hyper.my brain functions is not what it was, no memory, cannot comprehend alot, cannot focus, first half of day i am hyper(no caffeine), then at about 1:20 i start to crash. i am actually exhausted and hyper at same time. i have headaches which i have never had before,pain in right eye, bulging eyes, weakness.i went to a carddiologist to rule out my heart, it is all great.i am told and read that undiagnosed and untreated hyperthyroidism can lead    to calcium depletion(osteoporosis) quickly and am frustrated and concerned with what the overlooking of this condition has caused my body and overall health. is it possible to have both hyper and hypo at same time, and how can a person be heavy and hyper? also, i    read that rapid weight loss can cause an increase in    amiodarone, which can cause hyperthyroidism, is this so?also i have googled and researched bariatric surgery and hyperthyroidism and found that many people have been diagnosed post op with hyperthyroidism. is there a    direct or indirect correlation between the two?
2289,my legs get very itchy after i shower, this has never happened to me before but it's been severe for about 3 months. i use dove bodywash, and i put lotion (target brand) on my legs whenever they feel dry so i don't think it's dry skin that's causing this. it gets so much worse after i shave my legs that i've considered not shaving them anymore. i can't wear pants for about an hour after i shower or the itching is absolutely unbearable.is there a specific topical treatment i could use? lotions, bodywashes, etc? thank you so much for your input!
2290,hi,i walked in on my 5 (almost 6) year old son and 7 year old daughter.    he was touching her private area and they said that he was massaging her.    my daughter knew something was not right with what they were doing because she was afraid i would get mad.    i am worried about this behavior and what to know if it is abnormal or what?thanks,concerned mom
2291,hi    i have a soon to be 8 year old daughter who is causing me some concern.    she is excelling at school and the teachers say she is very clever, the problem however is that socially she is very immature.    she squeaks rather than talks and when she does talk its all baby language - this only occurs at home and never at school. she pretends on numerous occasions that she is an animal and slides around the house rather than walking.    she will never dress herself and has poor hygiene habits - forgetting to wipe herself and leaving toilet roll on the floor rather than flush it she also forgets to wash her hands on numerous occasions.    overall she is a lovely clever girl but i am very worried that she is not making friends like she should and is regressing back to being a baby and this behaviour is very worrying.    she stays with her gran after school while we are out working and she is surrounded by her cousins varying in age from 1 year to 10 years old so its not as if she doesn't see more grown up children.    i would add that she has a little brother of 3 who is already leaps and bounds ahead of her socially.    when we ask her to do things she can look at you blankly as if she really hasn't understood what you have said - its so confusing when her school work is excellent and progress reports at school are outstanding.    help!
2292,my 3.8 yr old and i were looking at pictures from before he was born. when he saw a picture of my husband and i he asked where was he. i responded that he had not been sent to fabrication yet (since he loves machines and things of that sort). now he asks where was i before fabrication. i was starting to explain the whole seed story when my husband suggested that i should stop, that he`s too young. i don`t know what to answer.the scientific side, the spiritual one?on another occassion he also asked what happens after we`re old? and insists if we go back to being kids again. i could easily answer we die. but the questions coming after that i`m alrealdy imagining. who`s god? ....what do you suggest?
2293,my mother was referred to undergo a ct scan with iv contrast on her lower abdomen. this was due to pain shes feeling on the lower left side of her tummy and lower back.    her attending doctor suspected an ovarian cyst when he tried to feel and touched the part that was pointed by my mother.i already got the result of the ct scan just now. but her doctor will not be available until next week.the lower abdominal ct scan says:history: palpable mass left lower quadrantaxial slices of the whole abdomen taken at 10.0mm interval without and with oral non-ionic iv contrast reveal a 2.0cm long ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta before its iliac bifucation, measuring approx. 2.8 cm in its maximal diameter with demonstrable intraluminal thin hypodense rim consistent with minimal thrombus formation found along its posterior wall.    the rest of the abdominal aorta including the iliac tributaries shows minimal segmental rim calcifications.impression:-distalmost abdominal aorta bordering to aneurism(aneurysm)with minimal thrombus formation-kindly correlate re: apparent findings of as follows:rectosigmoid polypoid lesions.left psoas to iliopsoas hypodense focus: to rule out a lesion like abscessresolving hematoma etc.-atrophic uterus with monkeberg's arteriosclerosis kind-incidental note of probable hepatic cystswhat does this mean in plain language?    can you help us explain what the result says?thanks a lot in advancemr. j

2295,i have a 16 months old daughter to whom i gave birth in c section.    there were complications (intrauterine cerebral ischemia, i believe is the medical words) and she used to take several medications including iv. she made a brain mri and the diagnosis reads as follows:protocol:axial t1, t2 & flair; sagittal t1&t2 and coronal t2 scanning of the brain are performed without contrast media.findings:both lateral ventricles and third ventricle are grossly dilated with elevation and thinning of the corpus collasum.    there is also bilateral perisylvian abnormal development of frontal and temporal gyrus with widened sulci and loss of corticomedullary differentiation.the basal ganglia and thalami are splayed by dilated ventricles otherwise the brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres are intact.    the fourth ventricle has normal size and shape.    the orbits, temporal region, sella and perisellar regions are normal.    there are normal flow voids on both carotid and basilar arteries.    the visible para nasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.    cranio vertebral junction is also normal.she has not still crawled, talked, walked.    she has also gross esotropia and she doesn't seem to see from far and also with concentration.i am worried about her and that if there is any solution for her, i want to try because i don't want to miss any opportunity she will have.    i also think that any treatment that will be available could be at an early age, which is her age now, and don't want to pass by the possible solution.    so please i need help! help! starting from what to do to the maximum solution.
2296,i am a single mother with a 21 month year old boy named dmitri. he has medical problems from the day he was born. a week after being born, he had such a bad eczema problem he appeared to be wearing a mask of cradle cap. we found out that this a reaction from an allergy to breast milk and other food that i was eating. we later discovered that he is allergic to food in general and also to many other allergens. his only source of nutrition is a diet consisting only of a formula called elecare. even on the diet, he is constantly broken out and itching due to many reasons. he also gets lots of flair up that consist of pus-filled and oozing sores on his body. this flair up causes him to be still getting up like a new born so he is often drained. he is on steroids and atarax twice a day among many other medicines. often, he is up to 15 different drugs and he takes the maximum dosage of each. i am worried about the long-term effects of these medicines. the doctors are now suggesting a feeding tube and that is a step i would like to avoid, if possible. they are also asking me to take him to a super specialist doctor but i can't afford it because my insurance won't cover it due to it being out of state. i would like to ultimately be able to feed him something other than his formula and get him healthy enough to not need so many medications so; he can have a normal childhood. this is his last resort. if we can't get him to a super specialist they're saying i might have to make funeral arrangements.
2297,i just want to know what are the efas or essential fatty acids that a human body needs? and i want to know what are the natural food or fruit or vegetable sources of efas? i also want to know what are the amino acids or essential amino acids that the human body needs and its natural food or fruit or vegetable sources? i am not very excited about synthetic sources really....i just want natural sources..

2305,my 5 yr old son and the neighbor boy, 6 yrs old, were caught touching each other inappropriately.    mouth to penis and penis to penis.    two different times.    the first time the mom's handled it the way we thought best.    the second time my husband was included and our children are no longer ever allowed to see each other.    this ends our friendship.    how do you know when it goes beyond natural curiosity?    the other mom has voiced concern in the past that she thought something had happened to her son.
2306,my 11 year old step son still poops his pants.    my husband and i got custody of my son when he was 5 years old.    his mother and us lived in diffrent states. she was not a good mother so we were able to get custody.    when we got him he was never fully potty trained.    he would have accidents but we would say he is young that is okay.    the whole 6 years we had him his mother would barely call or see him.    she would only see him in the summer.    he would have problems pooping his pants in school and it would fall on the floor and the teachers would call me after they found the poop on the floor.    he would not do it everyday but he would do it enough.    then bout 9 months ago we moved to the same state his mom lives in.    he has been seeing her everyother weekend.    since we moved here he does it everyday.    we have tried everything from making him wash them out, spanking him, embarrassing him, talking to him and taking all his toys away. nothing has worked.    i had doctor's tell me nothing is wrong.    i had counslers tell me to ignore it.    we have tried all that.    he smells so bad when he does it that my 6 and 7 year old children tell him he smells.    he said that he cannot feel it and it does not bother him if he is messy and smells.    then after he does all that he does not feel the need to shower.    my son is also adhd.    but i have a daughter that is to and she does not poop her pants. he also trys to hide it by putting the underware in hiding spots in his room. the next thing you know the house is smelly because of it.    he gets in the vehicle when the family goes somewhere and it is almost unbearable to sit in the van with him.    i feel sorry for the other kids because they have to sit back there with him.    i have asked everybody i know for help and all the ideas have been used. can anybody help!!!!
2307,i am scheduled to have a bi-lateral oophorectomy next month and am confused as to whether both or only 1 ovary should be removed.    i've been having severe perimenopausal symptoms as well as have cyst on right ovary. doctor doesn't want to put me on hrt now having these symptoms but will after the surgery.    are there any good reasons to only have 1 ovary removed?    i am 53, haven't had period in almost 9 months so am 3 months away from 'officially' being in menopause.    thanks to all!
2308,my seven year old boy had chesty problems from age one.was noticed more when he was asleep that he sounded realy chesty.doctor kept palming us off saying it was just viral but as we were not satisfied we took him to a&e where at the hospitial they gave him inhalers (brown and blue) when he was about 3 yrs old.when age 4 yrs he was rushed to emergency doctors whilst on holiday with a chest infection and was very pooly. now age seven he sometimes complains of headaches and quite frequently has nosebleeds,mosstly when hes asleep.he wakes up very distraught coverd in blood with blood stained sheets and cloths ect.the bleeds take a while to stop and are very heavy,on 1 occasion there was blood splatered all over the wall at side of his bed n he was covered.it seems 2 just pour not like a slow trickle.he has always been chesty over the yrs and can quite easily get colds. im worried that all this may perhaps be conected over his six/seven little years???...
2309,i work with pupils with asd and have been informed that one of our pupils has been trying on his mothers underwear at home, she caught him once but has been unable to discuss it with him. he is 12 years old and has asperger's syndrome. any ideas?this discussion is related toson cross dressing.
2310,last week a 6 yr old boy (we'll call him child c )at school came forward and told his teacher that another 6yr old boy,his friend (we'll call him child b)    had sucked his penis and he didn't feel comfortable with what happened. child b, when questioned how/why this took place, he stated that he had previously exchanged such sex acts with my son, we'll call child a. my son said he thinks it happened many many times, both he and child b    had sucked each other multiple times. he said they started with kissing, and he couldn't give me a reason why for any of it. he doesn't seem to know its wrong. my question is, do i completely freak out and assume he needs to see a psychologist, or is even something this gross normal ?    if my son had come to me and told me what happened i'd be less concerned, but sounds like he would have kept it up had the third child not come forward.the police were called, they aren't going to do anything cause they are all the same age, and the teacher who didn't see them hiding behind a bench on the playground doing this, will likely be reprimanded but not sure anything more will come of it.as it stands now, i'm scared to send him back to school. i'm not sure if he was victimized or if he is the 'perp' sort to speak. he said he's never seen such an act, no ones done it to him before and i'm a single mother with a tight grip on his life i feel comfortable that he's not been abused or exposed to this prior to this happening.where do we go from here ?
2311,my daughter who is 37 months old has recently been deficating on her bedroom floor and then playing in it during nap time.    she has a 3 month old brother and the behavior started around the time she was born.    i could not get her to leave diapers or pull ups on and so i switched her to underwear (she was born premature and has been slow to potty train).    if i remind her every hour or so to use the restroom she is usually fine with the occational accident, but i feel she is intentionally going to hide so she can play in her feces.    how am i suppose to get her to stop doing this?    i have tried everything i can think of from encouraging her to use the toilet to taking her privledges away from her.    it happens every single day!    please help!
2312,my daughter is 5 y/o and for the past year or so has been having episodes of extreme shyness/crying.    she has expressed activities/sports in the past year but when it comes down to participating in them she shuts down.    she usually will run to either of us crying and say she misses us wants to go home.    she is a very outgoing child at home and with her friends but becomes very shy once her participation is required for these activities.    i have been told she is shy at school as well but is coming out of her shell more. she is a very dynamic child and very social but seems to get shy at times for no apparent reason.    i am not sure what to do when these episodes occur i have tried several things but nothing works consistently.    i am concerned how she will be in kidergarten next year.    i am not sure if this is a phase or a problem i need to address.

2314,i have had my pouch over 16 years.    since then i have become hypothyroid, have developed fibromyalgia and am being treated for developing lupus.    i am on lyrica to help with the fibromyalgia.    in the last month i have started having night time incontinence once or twice a week.    it is not watery but normal stool.    i asked my doctor to treat me for pouchitis in case that is the cause and am on cipro and flagyl right now.    i am noticing that my muscles in my anus don't seem as tight as they were and don't know if that is due to my long term pouch or if maybe my lyrica is relaxing things?    does anyone have experience with this?
2315,dear doc,i recently had a baby 6 weeks ago and my 2 year old has reacted most likely the way she should, but i am out of ways to discipline her or how to react to the situaton. she is a very stubborn little girl with a big personality which on a daily basis is very hard to deal with, i cant leave the baby at all, i have to basically build a wall between him and his sister otherise she will hit him or fiercely scratch his face or head and if we are not careful he will cop an object thrown at him. she will take his dummy away and throw it. when i do let her have a hold or touch him she will be gentle at first, then she will attack him. i know it is all about jealousy but how do you cope and discipline this behavior as well all the normal 2 year old behavior. we have tried so many methods of discipline from ignoring the behavior, naughty corner, time out and talking to her but nothing is working and she keeps on doing it which is putting alot of pressure on the family. please help us.
2316,hi: a yaear ago i had my first born a little girl on 11/17/07 everything seemed well til my labor day, never got bigger than 2 cm and had to get an emergency c section after the nurse broke my water to speed thing i got a high fever and my daughter started to suffer, i was ok with the c section anything to make    my daghter be out of any danger. unfortunately i started bleeding out of control two hrs after the c section and i almost died so the doctor told me that the only thing that was left to do was a partial hysterectomy..the good part was that my baby never suffered any problem and now she is a healthy one yaer old, but i stillcannot get over the fact that i    cannot have kids again, but i do have my ovaries and everything    else so my husband says we still have hope: surrogacy, etc ! i feel so guilty when i feel as if my daughter is not enough i mean i want another child so much... at times i blame my self, others i feel as if something was done wrong on the medical side, but how to be sure... there is no way. hope someone can relate
2317,please help . . .    our precious 3 yr old nephew is going through a rough time while his parents work their way through their agreed upon separation.    his daddy lives some 5 miles away and though he sees him several times a week and sleeps over with daddy 2 or 3 nights a week, he cries at each house for the other parent.    the other night he was up nearly the entire night crying for his daddy, which finally brought his mommy to tears.     when he's at daddy's, he does the same thing, crying for mommy.     they try to have dinner as a family one night a week at one of the houses.    they are both very loving parents and give their son a lot of attention.    while this three year old is a smart & sensitive young boy, he also shows signs of bossiness and needing to control his environment.    he recently started in a small, home setting type    daycare, and is doing quite well with that, but it's a lot of changes all at once.     there's lots of love for him from grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.    anybody else going through (or gone through) this problem?    any suggestions would be welcome.    thanks - aunt janet
2318,my son has become overly sensitive in the last 6-12 months.    he's a very active and loving little boy.    he has many friends and plays well with them.    he's doing well (average) in school (preschool) and is learning at a normal to slightly above normal rate.he is extremely attached to my husband.    a short while ago, it seemed that every morning he would cry when his dad would leave for work.    hysterical crying.    that has gotten a bit better, so i'm not overly worried about that.however, if he wants something (stay up a little later, have someone lay down in his room with him while he goes to sleep, watch/play something on tv) and his request is denied, he begins to cry almost instantly.i've tried to remain calm with him and let him know that his crying is not going to change the subject...however, once in a while i do tend to get irritated and i get angry.    same with my husband.we feel as though his sensitivity is a result of our frustration and we've been trying not to react that way, but it just doesn't seem to get much better.any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    thank you.
2319,type your medical question heremy husband is a liver transplant recipient from 2003. he has stopped taking his medications. i found out he has not taken his anti-rejections medicines for at least a month. how long before this liver rejects?
2320,hii am 35 with 2 young children (5 and 2) and had a hysterectomy following the birth of my 2nd little boy, my ovaries were left in place.    march this year my ovaries were removed due to benign cysts and i am now on hrt (evo 75 mg i think).    i started on the lowest dose in march and last month was upped to the 75 mg dose as i was experiencing really bad mood swings and the hot flushes etc.    i have found my moods are fine now and the hot flushes are much better but i have no sex drive at all.    it really upsets me as well, as all i want to do is go to bed and sleep.    my husband is very highly sexed i guess and has no understanding and sex is very important to him, whereas now i couldnt care less.    is there anything i can do?    i find i am more just going along with it as i feel so guilty about always being asleep or not interested but it all feels like a pretence and no longer that enjoyable.    i am not dry or anything and it is not painful, it is simply i have no interest in it or enjoyment.thanks
2321,i have a son who is 8 years old and is struggling every day of going off to school, and leaving mom. he does go off with his dad to go fishing, to the store; he stay's overnight at his grandparents, for fun, periodically. he say's that it's easy because he is with family, but to go to school he is leaving me (his mom) and he will miss me. everyday it's a battle to get him to school and even for the teachers to get him to do his school work. he continually asks the teacher if he can call his mom. he is in the 3rd grade this year and in the previous years of grade school, my husband and i have never had this problem with him. i don't know what to do or how to handle the everyday situation? i'm afraid he will eventually have a low self-esteem, feeling that his parents don't want him because they are kicking him out the door to school, and that's not the case. he has an older brother who is 10 and two younger siblings 7 and 2.
2322,i had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and appendectomy due to severe endometriosis which had infiltrated my ovaries and was all over my other organs as well (plus a lot of endometriosis was also removed that had adhered to my bowels, bladder, and appendix) .    to help me avoid radical menopause sypmtoms, my doctor immediately started me on a .5 mg. vivelle-dot estrogen patch after surgery, and i felt fine.     two weeks later, he added a 100 mg. daily dose of prometrium to my hrt therapy to avoid recurrence of endometriosis growth.    my problem is that i am having unpleasant side effects from the prometrium, including exhaustion, minor headache, and lightheadedness.    i don't like how it makes me feel.    what other alternatives would you suggest to the 100 mg. prometrium?    can i take a lower dose or cream that would possibly lessen these side effects?    i would prefer to take only the estrogen, but my doctor is concerned that it could stimulate the regrowth of endometriosis.    thank you for your feedback.
2323,sorry i was gone for so long. my father spent weeks in the hospital, first for internal bleeding which then led to a heart attack. it was exhausting and long as i drove up to ny and back.i am so glad to be home.my father is doing much better. thank you all for you well wishes and notes!! :)
2324,hi, i have three children to which my two boys have special needs, varies from asd,add,pdd,adhd and separation anxiety. my daughter is the middle child who has not been diagnost with anything (thank goodness). but lately we have noticed that she tends to loose her short term memory. she is unable to remember her abc only via song. but if we are to point them out she cannot remember them and stairs in the blank sky. she is 5 now and has been in school for almost two years, everything she has learned, she cannot recall. if we ask her what she ate for lunch as an example she response i don't know, if we say what letter is this e.g d, she will stair at the page and become extremely quite and say euh i don't know. it is getting more and more stressful for all of us, as she cannot focus to remember. our concern is that she maybe trying to feed off the mental illness from our two boys. is there something we can do???a worried mom. stephanie
2325,i have a 7yr old son in the 1st grade that has some behaviour problems.    he thinks pinching is like playing.    i've tried everything i can think of as far as discipline and it has been frustrating for me to find a solution.    i don't know how else show him and what else to say to get him to know that it is inappropriate.    when he was 3 i had to deal with the biting and pinching and when i took him to his pediatrician, he stated that he was probably not happy with his environment.    so ever since then he was put in a school with a smaller environment and he improved greatly.    now i'm dealing with pinching and not listening since last year when he was in kindergarten.    i know i've been told that he is a boy and he is at that age, but i just don't want him to hurt anyone else and i don't want to hear anymore situations from the teachers or parents.    i am a single mother and i know it makes a difference if there is a male figure in his life but this is getting ridiculous.    he is also sometimes a monkey-see-monkey-do.    we all thought he would grow out of it, but i don't know it's still going on.    please help, any suggestions is greatly appreciated and accepted. :o)

2328,my boyfriend's 9 yr old (just barely) touched my 6 yr old daughter by squeezing her butt and putting his hand over her vagina.    all of this was over the clothes.    they may have been discussing being boyfriend and girlfriend, and he may have used terminology like i want to sex you up.    my daughter is almost done with her counseling and seems to be fine.    obviously, we don't allow the kids to see each other anymore.    at my urging, the boy is now going thru his own counseling.    i have a hard time thinking this was just playing doctor due to his age and the areas he was interested in.    my ex-husband called child services and the investigators deemed it child upon child activity with no findings.    he is, however, taking me to court for custody of the children since i did not break up with the boyfriend.    can my ex charge the boy with molestation?    does anyone agree that this seems out of bounds for normal child sexual development?    thanks
2329,we have a 10 yr old grandson that is living with us so he can go to our school district.    he has been having bowel movements in the tub, this has not just happend it has been going on for a while.    he is very backward and shy , his mother is divorced and living with someone for about 6 years now.    we have a feeling that he was abused by his real dad when he was about 3-4 years of age.    he was in counciling for about 2 years, it didn't seem to help.i some ways he is very bright, but in other ways i am not sure.    he has to have a routine for things , but we can change it at timeswithout too much trouble.    when he comes in from school the first thing he does is look at the clock and tells me what time it is,to the the excat second.
2330,what causes my 7 yr old to be so angry and aggressive towards me his mother and others    lifting his hands and trashing his room for no reason
2331,a few months ago i noticed a lump on my forehead. it isnt painful, actually it gets to be itchy at times. i haven't bumped my head or anything and the lump comes and goes. i would feel the lump grow around nightime but the next day its gone. however this time it looks like its been there for several days and i don't know why. what should i do?
2332,i am strongly against any and all flu vaccines and have been my whole life.    i have never had one nor have my 9 and 5 year old kids.    well my wife joined the panic bandwagon and just had to get it done.    my son they would only give the nasil which made me even more angry.    but the point to my question is that my 9 year old daughter who has cough variant asthma had her shot and 1 hour later she collapsed to the floor and was out for about 30 seconds.    whites in eyes showing.    she came to and the ambulance was pretty much at the house.    they took her to er and they did ekg, chest x-rays, blood work and a few other tests.    every thing came back normal and they said she must have just passed out due to anxiety or something due to the shot.    the dr gave me the most political answer when i asked if this could be a side effect to the shot.    she has never passed out in the 9 years she has been around all of a sudden she gets a vaccine and boom.    i just want a honest answer.    becuase the medical field does not want people to think vaccines are dangerous and when something does happen it seems like they try to hide it to not scare the rest of the community.    any answers would be great.    thank you
2333,doctor, i have followed with interest many comments on the issue of accessory breast in the armpit for more than a year. i have never seen a picture or heard of anyone that has the size of what is under my right armpit. it took a lot of courage to finally write this. it is not a tissue - it is a full breast with no nipple protruding. more than a handful if you tried to clasp. it has grown over a 10 - 11 years period. size kept increasing after my two kids. i was scared and still am scared what i will be told if i saw a doctor. it does not hurt at all. occasionally    (once every two/three months) i feel some sharp pain but in the right breast not in the accessory. recently, in the last 6 months, i also noticed a lump in the left armpit too - almost the size of a tennis ball. neither of them hurt. i do not consider these a cosmetic issue, i have only chosen to live with them silently out of fear that removing them might lead to complications or my pictures may be splattered over medical journals....but now i am also worried should they become malignant. i am about 5ft 8' and 200lbs. overweight but not fat. about 3 doctors who took a cursory look in the past claimed it was ancillary breast tissue and the little bumps i feel inside were nipples. but each time i touch both they feel lumpy. what do i do? sorry for long post...can no longer be silent. thanks.this discussion is related toaccessory breast tissue.
2334,contemplating a hysto. at the same time dr. does da vinci laprascopic to remove one ovary that has a 6 cm cyst on it.    i'm 55, past menopause, totally asymptomatic, never had kids.        no cancer in my immediate family, but definitely cardiovas. problems, dementia, and osteoporosis.    have been on hrt for 5 years.    after lengthy research, i've done a 180 from wanting to just take out both ovaries and be done with to wanting the doctor even to attempt to conserve the ovary with the cyst on it.        there's all sorts of issues that made me change my mind about the ovary removal; main problem with a full hysto., versus a partial leaving the cervix, is that the cervix may be of benefit to sexual enjoyment.         can't find mention of any other reasons to conserve the cervix, but that's a good enough reason alone, i think.     anyone with experience/opinion on this?     health downside to conserving cervix and removing uterus?    (i'm fine with continuing to have annual paps.)
2335,.... a little background history...... when i was 2yrs. old, a city dumpster fell on my, causing me to bleed internally,    having to have surgery. it left a scar, and as i grew, so did the scar -- it is now 10 by 1.5 across my abdomen, right below where my rib cage ends and seriously looks like a set of railroad tracks. my tummy looks like it is smiling. i have insant 'muffin top' because of this scar. apparently the scar has adhered to muscles, tissue, and lord knows what else.i am scheduled for surgery october 21st. the surgeon is going to cut out the entire scar, make sure that all the adhesions are 'gone' and then proceed to give me a new 'less visible' scar.anyone else have this kind of surgery?
2336,my son will eat nothing but bland food, by that    i mean for example chicken nuggets,    fries, raw carrots,raw peppers......anything with more of a taste and he will not eat it....for instance if i put ketchup on hisfries he won't touch them.i have no idea what causes this but i have not noticed any negative effects from it.    he does eat some fruit....does anyone recognize any of this and if so can you help??
2337,i am supposed to have a slipped lap band.    the gp who does the adjustments here in australia said no slip.    the surgeon who does the lap band surgery, said it was slipped and tomorrow i am getting a second opinion about it - is it slipped or not.i am having no sytmtoms that you would get with a slipped band - pain/problems.i am wondering, is it possible to have a slipped band without pain/complications and if it is replaced, what is the process that you have to go through before/after surgery to get back to eating normal food again.    i have been told two weeks prior to surgery, optifast and two weeks after surgery optifast and then two weeks of pureaed food/straw food.    i am not very keen on optifast and the other one i have the dietician had a problem with because it had to be drunk with skim milk - doesn't think it will decrease the size of the fatty liver.
2338,hi i have been chartiing my temp every day for the last month or so and i have ovulated a progestrone test came back to say i had but i dont see how my chart shows that. i keep to the times between 7-8 in the morning for taking temp. can anyone explain what im looking for and how it actually works really want to understand my body right now and could use any help.

2342,is it possible there is a link between these two?    the pain in my knees is getting worse by the day.    bilateral tkr on 12/29/2004 put me back on my feet again.    now i can only walk about 30 minutes a day which has come on in the last 60 days or so.    either there are defective parts already worn out in the implants or the pain is coming from somewhere else.    an orthopedic surgeon who i saw here in alaska (and i have no respect for asked me a couple questions and said i need to see their spine specialist)    he never even looked ay my paperwork for past surgeries and had me scheduled for an mri.    the paperwork said i had never had back surgery: that was not true.    i had a laminectamy l5 s1 in 1985 and never have experienced back bain since.    so with no back pain whatsoever how does this doctor think i have spinal stenosis?does anyone know if there is a link between the two?
2343,i just went in for my 2 wk post op chk up from a lapriscopic total hystectomy i discussed with my doctor before surgery that i wanted everything removed due to them finding a mass in my uterus and there already being a high risk of cancer in my family. but when i asked about hormones today he said you should not need them since you still have your ovaries. i was shocked & very angry cuz i have a history of ovarian cysts as well! but what i don't know is will i have a period since i have my ovaries but my uterus and cervix are gone???? can someone please answer this for me. i have been online for 2 hours trying to just find this simple answer and all the research i do tells me nothing!! any suggestions on where is a good place to get all the info i need would be most helpful! thank you!

2345,i had juvederm injections done under my eyes and in my laugh lines 9 months ago.    the filler under my eye were too swollen and the doctor removed some of it but she did an uneven job and 9 months later, i still have lumps under my eyes and lumpiness under my laugh lines.    can hyaluroidase still dissolve the product 9 months later?     will hyaluroidase    melt away natural fat/tissue or just the product? also, some days the swelling/lumps are much more dramatic than other days.    do you know what could be causing that?

2358,i have had mirena since december 2010. for the past month and a half i have been experiencing pregnancy symptoms. when i first started having symptoms i took a digital pregnancy test (first response) it came back positive, so i called my ob immediatly and they got me in right away for a urine test at the office. it was negative, skeptical i went home and took the other test from the box again it came back positive. so again i called the doctor and told them about it, and again they wanted me to come in for a blood test. so i went back and got the blood test. after i had it done i went back home and took another home pregnancy test (first response) this time it was not digital, it came back positive with a very faint line. then i anxiously awaited the phone call from the doctor then next day, finally it came! it was negative!! so being the skeptic i am, where did i go?? walgreens for two more brands of hpt's. i took one from each box and both negative. when those came back negative i just stopped thinking about it for a month and now here i am. i have been feeling movement, fluttering?? or maybe just gas bubbles. i also seem to have gained some weight, which could also be from not eating right.. i just dont know!!! i wanted to insist on a ultrasound after both of their tests came back negative, but i figured they already thought i was crazy so i didnt call back. so the question is, do you think i could indeed be pregnant?? should i schedule another appoinment? or is this all in my head? has anybody reading this had a similar situation and been pregnant? thank you in advance for your time and responses. :-)

2365,i had a hysterectomy dec.2010 due to fibroids and heavy bleeding.    i am 48 years old and sadly, didn't research things as much as i should have.    due to the economy, my husband had to take a job out of state and i work full-time and also raise my developmentally disabled adult daughter.    i was afraid of having another bad bleeding incident and was extremely anemic.    i thought a partial hysterectomy was just my uterus, leaving the ovaries intact and just found out that my doctor took my cervix also.    she never once told me that she was going to do that.    she in fact, pushed to take the ovaries, but i told her no.    now i'm afraid i will never enjoy sex again because of my dryness and i feel cheated out of a decision that i thought i made with all the knowledge and research that i did do.    i don't know how to handle this.    are there any women who feel the way i feel?    i feel castrated.

2370,i have been feeling like this since i was 12 years old and im 26 now. doctors never could find out what was wrong. been on numerous meds nothing helped. i tried smoking marajuana because i herd it helps with the nausea and it did. been doing this for some time now. i dont smoke alot, just one hit or two about 30min to an hour before i eat and i feel normal and can eat without any problems. not saying i think this is the best idea just nothing helped me and it got to a point where i completely stoped eating alltogether and started having more health issues. i got tired of feeling sick and never being able to eat i didnt feel normal and i lost hope and even got depressed and tried to commit suicide over it. im so glad i found a solution but i still wish i could just figure out what is causing this and have it taken care of.-drewthis discussion is related tofeel sick after eating.

2382,hello,,, on february 18th i had an endometerial ablation done.    it seemed as if i was progressing and getting better.the purpose of the ablation was to correct my irregular cycle.    i was having extremely long periods.    sometimes a month long.    but the periods were never heavy, so i was not aniemic.    i have had all the testing to rule out cancer.    that is not an issue.on    march 8th i started bleeding heavily.    the next day on the 9th, my husband rushed me to the er, i was flooding everything and passing huge clots.    my dr came to the er,,, after a carefull exam. it was decided that i was to start hormone therapy.i took 2 back to back prescriptions of hormones.    did not stop my bleeding,, it did stop the pain i've had with the constant cramping.    but the hormones made me extremely moody.ok,,, so i'm still bleeding, and still having severe cramps.    i've become a couch potato.    it seems as if anytime i do anything other than walking around the house,, i bleed and cramp.    i'm typically not a couch potato type of person.now,,, hysterectomy has been suggested.    and i have an appoitment in april for this.    i dont know what to do,, about ready to pull my hair out.    been bleeding since christmas eve.any insight from anyone would be greatly appreciated !
2383,hello,first of all, thank you for your time.i've recently been diagnosed with spina bifida occulta in my lumbar spine, accompanied by split cord there aswell.i also have a low lying conus medullaris due to a tiny bit of fat tissue connected to it at sacral level.i also had a congenital inclusion dermoid cyst in the back of my head (occipital region), which has been successfully removed when i was 2 years old. i'm 20 now.i've recently had a check-up mri of my head to see if the cyst had come back, but it hadn't.but i saw something else on the mri, which got me worrying a bit.it's about my cervical spinal cord, it looks as if it's going to split there aswell. the mri only shows a part of my cervical spinal cord, since it's an mri of my head. but it certainly makes it look as if it's about to split completely, since the posterior side of the spinal cord is already showing a split, which isn't normal i assume?i really think the posterior 'split' of the cervical spinal cord is there, and isn't due to me moving or something, because it shows in more than one series (with contrast, without contrast, coronal and transverse series).i don't have any symptoms in my hands or arms though (yet). well, the 2 smallest fingers of my right hand are a little smaller than they should be, they also look a tiny bit webbed, but no neurological symptoms.only the split cord of my lumbar spine is causing some -minor- neurological symptoms in my right foot and leg.could you please take a look at the photos i added, and tell me your opinion?should i have an mri done of my cervical spine? please let me know what you think.thank you for your timeblonmp

2385,good evening everyone!i have been desperately searching the web for some hope regarding my diastsis and the associated problems from it. i had back surgery in 2006 after having my son in 2005. i look like i am between 6 and 8 months pregnant and there is a physically visible and unquestionable separation of the abdominal muscles. i have digestive problems and have been on copious amounts of dangerous painkillers so that i can work (against doctor's recommendations) through the pain. i feel that my only chance to lose this hanging weight and lack of strength around my middle and get off these pills is to have this surgery. however, i cannot afford to pay for plastic surgery. what are the chances my insurance will pay? i have had a c-section and back surgery (lumbar area) and there is zero muscle tone to hold anything in. i have been put on anti depressants because of all of this and the meds i take (aside from their dangerous nature just because of what they are) cost my insurance between $1,000 and $1200 per month as it is. any advice at all will be so appreciated as i have been depressed and in pain just thinking i was fat and deformed until i read about the diastasis. now i feel there is hope, if i can get my insurance to cover it...i am going to post most of this online as well in the hopes that more people can offer me guidance. thanks again for your time, take care!i want to get my life back; end the pain, get off these dangerous meds, and feel good about myself again. maybe stop being depressed too...?!
2386,well most know that i had an abdominal hysterectomy on november 4. i have had several complications with the incision but for the most part the surgery has gone good and has helped. my incision has gotten infected which was reopened and stitched. few days after the stitches the infection got worse and away more painful yesterday the stitches had to come out because come to find out i am allergic to them and the infection is worse. the incision is very ugly looking and has broken back open again due to the infection, i have to wash it out three times a day and cover it...however i am allgeric to most band-aids and the bandage tape...any ideas what else i could use to cover it when it needs to be covered??
2387,i am 5 weeks post abdominal hysterectomy and now have pain below my belly button, i have several large lumps in my abdominal area that were very bruised right after surgery.    bruises went away, lumps stayed.    and i have pain that starts at the incision sight down the front of my groin area into my right thigh.    plus i have been running a low grade fever for 2 weeks.    spent one of those weeks on augmentin.    both the pain around my navel and from my incision down the groin and into the thigh get worse as the day wears on.    is this normal???
2388,honey is a well known bactricidal, and mildly neurotoxic, as long as it has not been pasteurized.    i am curious is anyone has a preferance for any special brand of honey, or a suggestion that one type of honey may be more effective than another in dressing a wound. or a protocol for using honey on a wound.
2389,i am suffering with rectal and vaginal pain, 3 months after my vaginal laparoscopic total hysterectomy.    i also had the removal of a large benign fibroid cyst/ tumor with a prolapsed bladder stitched into place.    i also suffer with and have interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.    i had my bladder stitched during the surgery but it appears my bladder has prolapsed and fallen again.    i have had 2 mri's , they can  t find any reason for my continues pain in my rectum that travels down my buttock on the right side and then down the back of my leg,    also severe    lower back pain. my vaginal pain is dull/ achy and constant, i take narcotic pain pills with very little relief, and i rely on muscle relaxers for relief but can hardly stand the side effects.    i suffer with constipation that  s a side effect of long term pain med use. i have had 4 natural child births, at 52 i  m left with little muscle strength from 4 episiotomies. does anyone have any of these same concerns? it has left me very depressed and stressed, my local ob wants to take a wait and see attitude while i suffer with the pain, i also had a quadruple heart by-pass surgery found prior to any heart damage occurring. the heart surgery was 7 month prior to the hysterectomy; i was cleared for this surgery and have no heart issues. i need to find answers so i can get some relief; i need to get my life back.

2391,hello! help please any suggestions are welcome?i had a mirena inserted in december of last year.    if definately pinched, and i was sore for quite a while after, but i made it through.    my periods last 10-12 days now, but at least i have some clue of when it's coming now.    how ever i am have huge mood swings right now, and finding this topic under depression freaked me out.    everything else is fine, i do have ptsd, but it's been under control for some time now, so to feel so awful and then find this topic under depression is curious to say the least.    if this mirena is going to make me depressed, then i need an affordable alternative because my isurance wants $300.00 for the appt, and $150 for the shot...and the community center won't take me since i have insurance. i'm wondering how long i can keep it in without doing damage to my insides if i do have to keep it.    i really can't afford to get depressed right now.    this is crazy.

2393,i have realized i am extremely sensitive to artificial sweeteners but also on a low calorie diet (i know what a curse, huh?) and have been digging up all the reaseach i can on them.found a site called www.splendaexposed.com that pretty much runs the gamutartificial sweeteners: this category of non-nutritive, high-intensity sugar substitutes includes aspartame, acesulfame-k, neotame, sucralose, and alitamenow i read this quote on the sitethe two safest choices of sweeteners to date are saccharin and stevia. yes, saccharin! saccharin is actually similar to stevia in its origin.    it originally came from a plant imported from china, and in its original form, is a complex sugar extract from the plant itself.    stevia is extracted from a plant grown in south america, and is also a complex sugar extract.i did not know this about saccharin (sweet and low). saccharin was the first type of artificial sweetener developed all the way back in 1878.can anyone confirm/has anyone heard that it is in the same category, safety-wise, as stevia?? i had never heard this    the info is from the above site and comes from a book called splenda: is it safe or not? by dr. janet starr hull.thanks

2398,i have a low ferritin level and my doctor put me on ferritin.    i called the compounding pharmacist in town to find out if it is availible to buy there and they said they have never heard of it.    i called my dr. back and they said that they are the only ones that have it available and i have to buy it in their dr. office (an integrative women's health office).    i am wondering what the difference is between ferritin and ferrous glycinate.    i am also wondering if the side effects of the ferritin are similiar to the other iron suppliments that are out there.    i am also wondering if ferritin is better absorbed with vitamin c and if taking ferritin with calcium can prevent optimum absorbtion.

2406,hello, i am posting this to reply to jane328 to whom i cannot reply directly.i have the same problem as you, jane,---clogged ears ever after a rhinoplasty, and doctors who cannot diagnose the cause of this suffering.i feel that my ears are clogged, essentially, because my nose is too small.i cannot get a proper volume of air in at once, creating a suction issue. i feel like i am breathing through cocktail straws.i feel this suction throws off my eustachian tubes' ability to equalize internal pressures. therefore, my ear drums are always a little retracted. their retraction translates as a feeling of pressure and clogging.i may not be expressing the nitty gritties of the technical issues involved correctly, but i believe the general expression that the unnatural pressures that have been created by having an extreme suction situation when breathing, or simply an unnaturally small nasal vestibule has created eustachian tube dysfunction to be correct.i would like to cotnact you, jane, to fund out what else we have in common. did you have an infracture of your ascending process of maxillae? what tests have you had done?please contact mepequita.elenorita@ymail.comthere are two dots in my email, one after pequita and one after ymail. please contact me. perhaps there is a light at the end of the tunnel for us!!!anyone who has any insight into this problem please contact me or post here, in addition. thanksthis discussion is related toclooged ears after rhinoplasty.
2407,first off, my question is not about a hysterectomy although it pertains to my question.    i am 36yo and had a abdominal hysterectomy twelve years ago, which included the removal of the upper portion of my vagina, cervix, and uterus.    i still have both my ovaries.    my concern is that i have had dry pasty white vaginal discharge for many years.    i wouldn't call it discharge because it stays stuck to my vaginal walls and does not flow out of me on it's own.    there is no itching, no odor what so ever. i have to use lubrication during sex with my husband because the discharge is so dry.     my doctor cannot find anything wrong.    my paps are normal, no yeast infection, bv infection, and no stds.     maybe someone on here can help me figure this out.
2408,i have several strange cravings lately.the first one is i have to constantly chew ice.    this is a constant behavior.    i have to get up in the middle of the night several times to do this.    and because of this habit, i do not sleep very much.also, i have a constant craving for dried rosemary.    i eat it by the handfuls.finally, this craving is not so strange i also feel the need or crave nuts, seeds, granola, etc.these strange behaviors and cravings are really taking a toll on me, and the ice chewing is making my family crazy!please let me know what you think, thanks for your help.
2409,hi...i just had the lap-band surgery on aug 19th...so i am 6 days out. each day has gotten slightly better than the one before as far as being able to get liquids down. yesterday was still very slow going. it would take about 3-4 hours to get one 11.5 oz shake down....slowly but surely. well...today i woke up and it seems significantly different. i could drink my shake in about 30 min. i also was able to drink way more water than the prior days combined. i had broth and a suger free jello cup all before it was time for my next shake. i am just wondering if any of you that have been through this had a point where the change was so major from one day to the next. i am assuming that alot of the swelling went down and it is just going though easier...but couldn't hurt to ask. thanks

2415,is it possible????    i had a hysterectomy and after surgery i could not move my bowels for at least 3 weeks!!    the doctor told me that sometimes our organs don't wake up right away after surgery.    well it became worst as weeks and months went on.    i was rushed to the hospital 4 months after surgery, i was having a difficult time breathing.    i was admitted and test were done.    i was backed up with poop, and had to have an enema, which really did not do much.    i then was instructed to drink a gallon of some stuff (that they prep you with to have a colonoscopy).    that was a nightmare, as i was drinking this, i became very bloated and nausea.    it took, 15 hours before i could move my bowels.    a total of 2 days drinking and pooping and i still was not cleared out!!    still having trouble moving my bowels, sometimes days before i could go and then a week.    i called a gastro doc and he set up a colonoscopy.    i had to prep 2 days before the procedure.    the morning of the procedure i still was not cleaned out!!!!    yuck.......still had to have the test.    now come to find out i have colonic interia, but never had problems before the hysterectomy.    i have also been having problems with my left leg (nerve) and 2 small toes going a little numb on me................but again never had this until the hysterectomy!!!!i am a very active person, previously had 3 c-sections and when i was just 10years old i had to have my right ovary and tube out........due to a cyst that had twisted my ovary.    i have also had 2-3 laporoscopy's.    i know i had alot of scar tissue, but when the gatro doc had gone in he said and put it on his report, colon features a sigmoid that is sharply angulated.............only on the left side.    well when i had the hysterectomy all i had left was the whole left side(ovary & tube).    is anyone else experiencing these problems.    i have never gone to a doctor for being constipated until i had the hysterectomy!!!!    is it possible they might have damaged muscle and nerve and the left side of my colon when they performed the hysterectomy????

2424,my 3 year old has regular constipation.    she is also small, 30 lbs, so it is hard to feed her high fiber foods that help her constipation and still allow her to gain weight.    when she eats high fiber foods, she won't eat as much as she should and therefore doesn't gain weight.    to add to the trouble, i give her nutritional drinks to help her gain weight cause she is so picky.    could i start mixing some benefiber with her milk and help her get fiber that way?
2425,years ago i had a hysterectomy...2 years post i had a ct scan which showed what the radiologist said was an ovary.    the doctor was defensive and said it was impossible. my gp sent me for a sonogram, and it was a mass and regrowing ovarian remnant. i just had a ct scan over a month ago, and the radiologist said there is a small uterus but it looks like i had a partial hysterectomy. i asked my gyn as before, and he was defensive as before. my gp is in haiti on mission. should i let it go, and assume it is a misread? what advice would you offer? i've been having abdominal cramping, but just assume it is ibs or something.thank you.kira***@****
2426,considering this versus a hysterectomy since dr. feels i would be a good candidate now.    please no comments from hers    foundation, i already know what you think.    thank you.
2427,i'm taking 50,000iu vitamin d3 per week because of my low vitamin d level.within a few days, the following symptoms developed:- extreme thirst that won't go away with fluid- fast heart rate (i could hear hear beating in my ears whole time)- muscle tightness- extreme fatigue (could sleep 24hr if i wanted)- increase in appetite (found this to be good since i've always been underweight and not much appetite)so, i did some research and read that these symptoms are caused by magnesium deficiency.    so, i tried high doses of magnesium with vitamin d for a few days and it did not help a bit (even tried topical magnesium oil which is known for best absorption).i also read that these symptoms are caused by high calcium in blood.but, i wanted to try 500mg of calcium just before i give a rest to the recovery due to the extremely uncomfortable symptoms. and within a few hours of taking calcium those symptoms disappear, and i get great energy that i have never felt before.can someone explain why this happens? i thought all those symptoms are from high calcium in blood so i was supposed to avoid calcium and take magnesium instead????? so confused......
2428,i learned from a physical therapist after gallbladder surgery, and same pain returned,that i might be having trouble with my diaphragm, how can i a low income senior get help with this very painful situation?
2429,i'm 33 years old and had a complete hysto 15 months ago.    everything is great except i have no sex drive.    sex ranks up there with cooking and cleaning.    i am on hormone replacement with testostirone.    that does not help.    it is not painfull just not something that intrest me in the least.    my husband is not happy.    he tries to understand but he is man.    anybody got an idea?
2430,i had a partial hysterctomy 10 years ago.    so, as i still have my ovaries, i still go through pms symptoms that are regular.    my biggest complaint is breast tenderness!    trust me, i do like when they get larger every month, but it seems like about every 3 months they are unbelievably swollen and sore!    this month was my worst experience...my boobs were sore for 9 days!    my co-workers even asked if i got a boob job!    it felt close to when you quit breastfeeding!    i will be 41 in april and i've been reading alot about hormones lately.    i think i may have 'estrogen dominance'.    my question is this:    how do i figure out the 'days' of my cycle?    i can't seem to find a website that helps women like me that has had a partial hysterectomy and understanding how the hormones work with our bodies when we don't have a period!    i have just ordered a cream that has black cohosh, evening primose, & other plant extracts to help balance hormones.    does anyone else have these issues?
2431,i do take take presription medications due to heart attack 3 years ago. also take vitamin c, multivitamin, co-q 10, fish oil, saw palmetto and milki thistle. i am wondering- do you take any break from vitamins? lets say once a week, a month...? or you take them all the time with no breaks? there is a very little data about this. thank you in advance for your answer
2432,why treat nutritional deficiency with drugs?(omns, november 13, 2008) a recent study suggested that statins might be used to avoid the effects of nutritional deficiency. writing in the new england journal of medicine, the jupiter group described a study of statin drugs in people with high c-reactive protein and low cholesterol. (1) high c-reactive protein levels are associated with inflammation and heart disease/stroke. the authors concluded that, in apparently healthy persons with elevated c-reactive protein levels, rosuvastatin (crestor) significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events.their much-publicized claim, that this statin lowers the risk of heart attack by approximately one half, is technically correct though highly misleading. the reported annual incidence of coronary events was 37 people in 10,000 (controls) and 17 people in 10,000 (treated). similar results were reported for risk of stroke. when expressed as a proportion, a 46% improvement (17/37) sounds large. however, an improvement of 20 events (37-17) in 10,000 people known to be at risk is less impressive. such an improvement means that 500 people (10,000/20) with this increased risk would need to take the tablet daily for a year, to prevent one person suffering an event.the paper does not explicitly report deaths. one reason for this may be that if a person on statins suffered a heart attack, that person was about three times more likely to die than a control who was not on statins.the cost of rosuvastatin per person is approximately $1000 per year. so, treating enough people to prevent one heart attack costs $500,000 per year. since about 70% of the heart attacks were not fatal, prevention of a single death from heart attack would cost even more, approximately $1,700,000. giving the benefit of the doubt, we may allow for a similar reduction in stroke and say that only $250,000 is needed to protect one person from a stroke or heart attack. it is hardly surprising that astra zeneca's share price increased by $1.3 billion dollars on release of this paper and the corresponding media hype. (2)the media suggested millions of healthy people could cut their risk of heart disease by taking statins. (3) they also claimed that statins could cut the risk of heart attack for everyone. (4) this is inaccurate and incorrect. the study did not include normal healthy people, only a sample of a relatively small number of people, suffering from inflammation (increased c-reactive protein) - a known cause of heart disease and stroke. out of 89,890 people considered for inclusion, 17,802 people (19.8%) met the specific criteria of poor health for the study. widespread prescription of statins to healthy people is not supported by these findings.the fact that statins produce a modest improvement is unsurprising, since they are known to lower inflammation, as do many nutritional supplements. as bill sardi has pointed out, crestor lowered c-reactive protein by 37%, but vitamin e lowers it by 32%, (5) and vitamin c by 25.3%. (6,7) these effects are similar to those of statins and would be expected to provide comparable benefits, without side effects and at a lower cost.crestor and other statin drugs have serious side effects. the incidence of established side-effects, such as rhabdomyolysis (0.3 per 10,000 per year), myopathy (1.1 per 10,000) and peripheral neuropathy (1.2 per 10,000 per year) seems low, (8) but may be underestimated as it takes time to establish long-term side-effects. (the depletion of coenzyme q10 by statins is a particular concern.) the figures imply that for every ten people who avoid a cardiovascular event, at least one previously healthy person will suffer a non-trivial side effect of the statin drug.the doctors reported a statistically significant increase (270) in diabetes in the statin group compared to the placebo group (216). over the course of the study, this corresponds to an increased risk of approximately 61 in 10,000 people. so, the number of people on statins reported to become diabetic was greater than the number that avoided a heart attack! these people might have shorter lives and be at greater risk of heart disease in the long term.notably, the jupiter study was stopped early, which the authors admit prevents assessment of how side-effects might outweigh reported benefits in the longer term. the study was to last 3-5 years and the criteria for stopping were not included in the original published design. (9) the paper claims that when the study was stopped these [diabetic] events were not adjudicated by the end-point committee. the committee either knew about the diabetes in which case it was considered, or it did not and the committee was not doing its job properly.the jupiter name stands for justification for the use of statins in prevention: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin; the reader might think this justification sounds more like a marketing plan than a scientific endeavor. the researchers did not address the underlying cause of the inflammation and increased c-reactive protein: they simply treated the condition with drugs. in many cases, raised c-reactive protein is a result of nutritional deficiency. (10)it is worth mentioning that several nutritional supplements inhibit inflammation and lower c-reactive protein, without causing known side effects. deficiency in vitamins a, (11) b6, c, e, a, folate, carotenoids and lycopene, (12) and selenium (for example) is associated with raised c-reactive protein. (13,14,15) we suggest that the $250,000 cost of preventing a single cardiovascular event with rosuvastatin might be better spent funding a study of such inexpensive alternatives the deficiency of which may be the cause of the problem.the people at risk could be encouraged to supplement their diet and restore their health without using these expensive drugs to conceal their underlying sickness.stick with the supplements!
2433,i have been having re-occuring boils about once every 2 months. it comes, pops then goes away. i went to the doctor and he gave me an antibiotic to help kill off the bacteria that could be causing it. i have already taken one anti-biotic, and it says to take two every day for two weeks, but after researching, i don't want to use the anti-biotic anymore and would rather fight it naturally. i am big on tea (green, white, etc.) and try to eat healthy foods. i would go the natural way, but i'm now worried that since i took one pill, i am letting whatever bacteria there is build up a resistance to it. should i try to fight it off naturally with nutrition, sleep, and exercise, or keep taking the antibiotic so the bacteria won't become resistant. thanks!
2434,i am a 32 yr old female, i weigh 220 an 4' 11'.    i currently suffer from high blood pressure, pre diabetes and anxiety.    i only take medication for the blood pressure tho.    i do not like taking medication due to the side effects!    can anyone give me some advice on any other things i could try to help my problems??    my anxiety gets even worse when its time for my menstrual cycle, i feel so weirded out that i don't know what to do...    i just wish there was something out there that could help an not have all the awful side effects.    thanks for any help!!!

2444,i sweat a lot all over my body. i recently got rashes all over my body which itch a lot, especially on my belly, groin and under armpits. now the rashes have spread all over my body. tried many ointments, talcum powder but to no avail. i had recently travelled to my worksite, this is the second time i've got allergy after visiting the worksite.    don't know if any plant is causing this. my doctor says it is due to sweat, but there is no relief. i also am a diabetic, though blood-sugar level is not very high.i do have my tablets regularly. thank you in advance for the answer
2445,about axillary breast tissue not being a problem post-partum / breast feeding; i discovered i had such tissue while pregnant (excessive swelling, pain). when breast feeding, it only got worse. after my daughter was born, we tried in vain to get her to latch on. most of the time, she would not, so formula supplemented her. in the meatime, the extra milk i carried (not going to my daughter) gathered up in my axilla - all the way down to my elbow! (very tough tissue where once was soft); the axilla was swollen so much, it was like a golfball, and i could not lower my arm without tears in my eyes. i expressed what i could for relief (painful to do), but after several weeks, i had to dry up naturally (oh - more pain) to stop the process altogether. talk about post-partum depression! we both survived, but now years later, i still have pain and swelling - not as bad of course, but the tissue is the reason. i am definitely going to look up lipo or resect surgery. it is time! i would love to go sleeveless like i did in my 20's. all the exercise and weight lifting can't alone help this problem...this discussion is related toaxillary breast.
2446,i have been on my period for almost 3 weeks and it changes every day. i had a tubaligation 7 years ago. i can't be pregnant. what else can it be.
2447,i had lap-band surgery 5 weeks ago and am having a terrible pain in my left side under my rib cage towards my back.    does anyone else have this or does anyone know what this could be?    it hurts the worst when i am walking around.    it is like a bad cramp after eating and going swimming or something...the pain is intense and makes it hard to take a breath or even walk but the weird part is, it comes and goes.    this has been happening for about a week now...any suggestions???
2448,assume one is in the very earliest stages of kidney disease with a gfr of 85 while >90 is considered normal.    what kind of dietary ristrictions should be followed?    at what point is it necessary to reduce dietary phoshorus, potassium and salt?    what levels should they be reduced to?    is this for the purpose of maintaining normal blood levels of such or is it to reduce stress on the kidneys?    what is the amount of protein restriction?    also, are magnesium supplements harmful to the kidneys?    or is it just that someone with impaired kidneys may run into a problem.    are there any vitamins and minerals, if so at what dose?
2449,i wear a ostomy bag    for ayear now and lately the smell that comes from my pouch is awful i am embrass when i am in public sometimes the pouch would make loud noises and then here comes the smell i take a lots of meds iron pills    and hibh blood pressure cholestrol meds and diabetic meds also please give me    some helpful information on this    problems.

2452,my sister had a hysterectomy coming up to 2 years this may, an she has never recovered. she has seen countless doctors, an been back for keyhole surgery since, an has never been told exactly what has happened. she is now in a wheelchair, an suffers constantly with unbearable, an only what she can describe as severe pressure pain, and she feels as though she is dragging her stomach behind her. she is now on mophine, an a lot of paracetamol. she doesnt get any relief hardly with the pain, an cannot do anything at all for herself. it was supposed to be a straightforward hysterectomy, and a large fibroid removed, but this has turned into a nightmare. before she had this op, she worked full time. can you help in anyway. ann
2453,do you know why your dr scheduled one set of days as opposed the other. i'm on clomid 5-9 and i've read that there is more success with days 3-7?    just wondering the rationale for both.
2454,hey i am a 22 year old white male. i try to lift 4 times a week and run once or twice. i am pretty skinny but have gotten some tone over the past year. i take whey protein right after my work outs, and occasionally for breakfast as well. i was just thinking about starting creatine before lifting and wanted to get some opinions on this. i wanna max my results, but in a healthy long-term way. everything i have read is pretty mixed reviews.thanks!
2455,i have always been a very skinny person. i have a super fast metabolism and although i can eat an enormous amount of food i never seem to gain any weight. in fact, its like i actually loose weight. i feel like i am wasting away and there isn't a thing i seem to be able to do to make myself get heavier. does anyone know if there are any types of meds i can be prescribed or something to do that can help me get a little meat on my bones?
2456,if people are using marijuana to combat the effects of chemo i don't understand why anyone would be concerned with long term effects as it would be used ( supposedly ) short term. any drug has negative effects if over used. some would say if doctors are not getting a kick back ( like they do from prescription drugs ) they would be likely to combat any so called home remedy. i think the medical marijuana issue has some merit but the government is to lax on policing the care givers or pushers depending on what side of the fence you are on. in michigan i know that people are mis-representing the need to use it;but its a fast growing business in times of economic hard times.
2457,i have a swollen gland in my arm pit that is tender to touch and making my arm and hand swell. should i be worried?
2458,i am a overweight registered nurse who has 25 more years before i retire. i work on a busy telemetry floor and in constant pain. my knees are going bad and etc. i dont enjoy my life anymore. i live across the street from a park and havent been there in years with my kids. my question is ,does anyone know a bariatric center or hospital that finances the clients themselves? my credit is not up to par but i can certainly make monthly payments on the lapband surgery. i can afford up to 2 payments a month. im just having problems getting financed!
2459,hello ladies, i had a total abdominal hyster in jan. 09. i was put on vivelle dot .1mg 2x a week. i have done well so far considering the hot flashes, mood swings, ect. i however totally lost my appetite after my hyster. i lost alot of weight, and being very thin already was not a good thing.i have been now adding a medication called megace (a progestin) which is given to people w/ certain hormone related cancers and to people w/ eating disorders.    it has indeed helped and im eating everything i can get my hands on.i am wondering tho, if it is used for estrogen dominant cancers, ie, blocks estrogen, should my vivelle dot be re evaluated? i have noticed sore breasts/nipples and some mild hot flashes since starting the megace.    can anyone shed some light on this for me???
2460,i hear and read about what i should not eat, what is left? what kind of foods do you all eat? i have a triple whammy. i also have type 2 diabetes and thyroid problems. please help!!

2462,novasure vs hysterectomy     women's healthwhen was novasure created 20 years ago?    how long has the procedure been available?is having the novasure procedure and uterine ablation just a bandaid for a hysterectomy? i'm 53 had ectopic pregnancy, 2 miscarriages, 3 abortions, (no full term) 3 d & c, perimenopausal,    i go through 10    pads a day for the first 5 days of my menstral cycle and my period lasts for 10 days.    i might skip 1 month ot 2 then i'm like clock work again. i had a myomectomy 3 years ago.    family history my mom had a hysterectomy 51 many fibriods and heavy bleeding. will i have to take hormones if i get a hysterectomy?thank you for your quick comments!
2463,i had this injection on the 3rd may which includes diphtheria toxoid/human poliovirus type 1 inactivated/human poliovirus type 2 inactivated/human poliovirus type 3 inactivated/tetanus toxoid and since then i have developed symptoms which have gradually become worse. the next day i felt uncomfortable with my left eye as if my eyelash was constantly in contact with my eye. i then felt numbness around my forehead which moved towards my eyelid and the top of my head. i was told that it was due to my trigeminal nerve first branch being affected and that it should improve in time. unfortunately it has not improved and i have developed a tingling and burning sensation in my left arm and leg (the injection was given into my left arm). at times i have found it hard to breath and i have felt a pressure on my lungs. are there any other cases that are known like this and what could i do to improve? can someone please help me?
2464,so i just left my dr and i thought id share the info she gave me.i was getting a mix of pos and neg hpt and she said clomid will do that if you take hpt too early because clomid does something with another hormone that your putuitary (sp?) glad releases and causes the false positives.and also clomid can make you have pregnancy like symptoms.
2465,hiseptember 02 2010 woild make it 2 years since i had a partial hysterectomy. (my womb was removed). i am 40 years old and without a child. is there hope out there for me?in case you're comtemplating on having a hysterectomy, please do it as a last option and after you have had numerous opinions. i went in to had a fibriods removed but my uterus was taken to safe my life or so i was told. i would never had willingly had the surgery done.if you ask me, i don't feel normal. i have the emotional swings. most important of all, i do not feel sensual and because of this i feel less then a woman.    i think i rather had die with my womb intact then have a hyterectomy. enough of my rants and back to my question: is there hope of me having a child?
2466,if i had a partial hysterectomy, cervix and ovaries intact, can i still have mini periods or spotting    from lining of cervix?
2467,i had a hysterctomy (uterus and ovaries) about 10 weeks ago.    for the first 7 weeks i felt great.    when i returned to work three weeks ago, i started staying tired, even on weekends, everything started hurting, i spent last thurs. with a pillow over my head because of a headache, and my heart started pounding.    according to my doctor, i'm fine; i should have had the symptoms weeks ago, but they're normal.    i trust my doctor, but i really don't feel fine.    i've tried working on hobbies and stuff, hoping it would make me feel better, but it just doesn't. i'm so tired that all i want to do is lay down.    is there anything i can do to keep going until this passes?    i'd like to still have a job when it's over.
2468,i am getting ready to get started taking hcg and i have had a total hyster rectomy and i wonder if it will mess with hormones?
2469,my brother had a triple bypass heart surgery nov. 15, 2011.    he is also diabetic with high blood pressure and high cholesterol.    he is most recently suffering from depression due to the lengthy post-surgical recovery period.    he is 55 years old and owns a car dealership.    he desires a homeopathic approach to assist with the depression.    he has never been prone to depression previously.    please contact us with any assistance you can offer.    thank you.

2471,one of my friends tried to donate blood recently, and the red cross report told him that he tested positive for malaria. he is american, but has had a lot of exposure to tropical countries over the past 4 years, and his last visit to india was two months ago. he doesn't know if he has parasite falciparum or vivax.he lives in washington d.c right now, but does not have health insurance. he has shown no symptoms of malaria whatsoever, but both the tests that red cross administered came back as positive.he does not know what to do, as treatment may be so expensive in the us. he will be making another trip to asia in mid-january, and wonders if it is ok to wait until then to go to a doctor.what would you suggest?thanks so much,shruthi
2472,i'm a 22 year old female, i weigh 209.5 lbs currently (weighed 215 lbs on nov 8th when i started my diet plan), and i'm 5'2'' tall. i now exercise 45 minutes 4 times a week and aiming to every day of the week. when i calculated my bmr (according to moderately active since i started exercising and i move a lot at home with my two little kids), it was 2440.my diet plan is eating 1440 calories a day, and exercising as mentioned above. i should mention that before starting on nov 8th, i had not exercised or done anything close to exercising (not even walking, i hardly ever go out since i had my kids), and i started with 45 minutes of light calisthenics (focusing on abs, legs, and arms - tracy anderson method for post-pregnancy exercise). i have also noticed that i usually reach only 50% of my needs of calcium, iron, and potassium per day.about a week ago, i started to feel suddenly unable to breath right, not while exercising or after it, just arbitrarily. i just feel like i can't take a good deep breath for a short while and it comes and goes throughout the day. can this be related to my diet or exercising? maybe due to low iron intake? although i have had mild anemia when i was pregnant, never got it checked again after that and stopped taking iron pills after childbirth. any thoughts?
2473,i had my surgery 4 weeks ago using the da vinci robot. recovery is going well. however, when i left the hospital my thighs had some numbness on the surface and deep pain. the skin feels and looks odd, kind of scaley. when i mentioned it to the doctors and nurses, they thought it was due to the nerve irritation when lymph nodes were taken. has anyone else had this type of pain?
2474,about 3 years ago i had a complete hysterectomy. since having my hysterectomy i have experienced pain on my left side, where my ovaries would be. over the past three months the pain has become more intense and happens more often. i had an ultrasound, but it showed nothing out of the way. do ultrasounds show scar tissue? and if this persists the next step will me be an mri, will that show scaring and if it is scaring what can be done?
2475,i am a 44 year old femaile who has been on premerin for many years now,,,,all of a sudden i have developed pains in my breasts, like growning pains.    i can't lay on my left side for longer than 20 min. without it killing me.    i had a mamo and ultra sound and they both came back normal....does anyone have any thoughts.
2476,found this article and thought it might be interesting to those looking for information about research into corneal transplant alternatives:http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2012723870_eyes26.htmlbest wishes to all.
2477,this is just a thought i've had:     most if not nearly all bacteria live in an acid environment. if the body is too acidic them you become ill.    simples !!!this is quite hard to reverse,    so......     what about the idea mine to wash through the vital organs etc. with an alkaline substance,    for instance.    magnesium.this is similar in substance to the idea of an epsom salt cleanse.    (which i do myself)......but perhaps just a simpler version of this may be a good idea for ills.     it seems to make sense to me.any thoughts anyone ??
2478,i am only 11 but everything i eat makes me feel very sicki went home sick yesterday and i fell asleep when i got home....it's 4 am and everyone is asleep and i can't wake them upanswers???
2479,i have done the hcg diet and it worked well for me, my energy was high, it seemed like my body actually tolerated it very well.    i iost 38 lbs.    now another problem has arisen since.    i have extremely low cortisol levels ( adrenal insuff) have you ever heard of any other users of hcg with this problem?
2480,i had a total lah along with a rectocele and perineal body repair. it's been over 3 months and my stitches at the top of the perineum (bottom of vaginal opening) are still there and very strong. because of this, my husband and i cannot resume sex yet. (did try once and my poor dh got cut!    ) i don't think that they are long enough for a doctor to grasp and a thin layer of skin may have healed over the stitches. i've heard of stitches not dissolving even after 11/2 years! is that true? if the doctor can't get a hold of them to remove them and they won't dissolve on their own, is there anything i can put on them to help them along? i'm having trouble with my insurance company paying for the surgery and surgeon is out of state. therefore, i cannot afford to go to the gyn unless i know beforehand that there is something that can be done. any advice?
2481,okay...so i've tried so many things in the past to relieve anxiety, and none have helped much...gave up coffee, but then started back up again...which was stupid because it really was helping.as most of you know, i have a doctor induced phobia of taking pills...even the thought of taking herbal supplements scares the daylights out of me because of all the bad experiences i've had in the past with medications. even taking vitamins scares me...silly i know, but...true.anyway...thought it's about time to quit smoking as well. i've read the literature...i know how bad smoking is...i know it causes anxiety and does not relieve it in any way, shape, or form.now is a very good time to quit because i have the urge to do so. i have been having very bad chest pains for the past week now...not sure if they are anxiety induced or not, but i don't care...i need to stop smoking, and need to do it now!i am reading allen carr's easy way to stop smoking ( which someone on here suggested about a year or so ago)...other methods have failed me miserably.allergic to the tape on the patches, can't chew gum, keep swallowing the lozenges, etc.allen says in his book that there should be no added anxiety when trying his method...but for those who have a preexisting anxiety condition? i'm not so sure.anyway, i've heard that certain smells can alleviate anxiety. i know this to be true to a degree, because the smell of avon's soft pink bubble bath always used to make me feel soooooooo good....i would relax and fall asleep just smelling it.but of course, like all good things, they took it off the market because they needed to make room for new    ( nasty smelling  imho ) aromas...at least that's the excuse they give when you call them or write to them.so...anyone know of any other nice smelling products or such that may help?lavender doesn't cut it with me anymore...makes me nauseous and gives me headaches now.can't even drink the lavender tea...which used to help.there are many essential oils out there, but not sure which would be the best...also not sure of exactly how to use them. do you put them on your skin? in a pot of boiling water?thanks in advance to all.

2489,somebody please help me with this a.s.a.p please. ok the story is i was having sex with my girlfriend a couple of nights again and since i'm uncircumcised i happen to go in to hard the virgina and the skin pulled back and i just started bleeding everywhere so i went to the emergency room and the dr. told me to just put on neosporin because it was just a little tear. the tear got healed but then i got a rash inside the foreskin and it's really really itchy and if i try to pull the skin back it hurts to much to even do that. i don't know if it was the neosporin or something else so i stopped using it but its still there. please help me with this a.s.a.p, the itchyness is driving me crazy and when i happen to urinate it stings a little on the sides because i guess the pi hits the rash.thank you.
2490,i received a tetnus, hep a, and typhoid shot last thursday (all in the same arm) and i have noticed a lump about the size of a golf ball in my arm pit.    it is painful when i touch it.    when i put my arm down, you can tell i have swelling.    i have been traveling all this week and will be out of the country for 10 days (nicaragua).    should this cause me some concern and should i see a dr. before i leave on thursday?

2493,i have had life long anxiety with a huge flare up last november. i tried ssri's, which helped some, but seemed to send my digestive system off track. i tappered off the meds but my stomach is not good. i have never been able to take medicine, my stomach is very sensitive to it. but now, i have unbelievable painful flares, nausea, constipation, loose bowels. i can barely eat anything. i have lost 40 pounds so far. the anxiety seems to be increasing again. the two weeks before my monthly cycle i feel near crazy.i would like to treat this as naturally as possible, but will go back to ssri's if i have to just to get back to normal. any suggestions that could calm my anxiety and my stomach?thanks so much!
2494,i'm entering nursing school, and before starting my clinicals, i had to get mmr, pertussis, and tetanus vaccines. ten days after vaccination, i had bloodwork done. my white count was low (2.8), as were my neutrophils (1.5) and the monocytes were high (15). also, i woke up one morning, about a week after the immunizations, with hands and feet that had swollen, painful joints. i rarely get sick, in fact, i haven't had as much as a sniffle for over 3 years. can the low counts be from the immunizations? i'm not at risk for hiv.

2497,my 4 year old son refuses to eat any kind of meat or vegetables.    he has been this way since he was 1 yr. old and has never eaten any table food.    he will take a couple bites of a banana or pb & j and say he is finished.    i'm really getting concerned because it has been so long and i keep thinking he will grow out of it, but he's not.    he watches his father and i eat all the time, but is not interested in trying any foods.    he is 43 tall and weighs about 37 lbs.    i have mentioned this to his doctor, but he only says he is normal weight and doesn't seem too concerned about it.    he says he doesn't like foods when he hasn't even taken a bite.    do you have any advise or suggestion for me?this discussion is related tomy 4 year old will not eat!!!!!.
2498,i have had endometriosis since the age of 12, am now 42 yo.    i had bso hysterectomy last july.    my dr. believes a little bit of endo remains behind my cervix (kept that).my dr. would like me to take 3 mos. of lupron to suppress any remaining endo.    is this safe to do after bso hysterectomy?
2499,i just had my laporoscopy/hysteroscopy done to clear scar tissue and endometriosis. i have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks and we are going to start on clomid. i had a m/c in 2010 at 14 weeks, then lost twins in 2011 at 9weeks- there was blockage in my tube, scar tissue from previous csection in 2004 that pulled my ovary under my uterus and was about 3/4 covered in scar tissue that is now removed :)    so dh and i are ready to ttc and pray for a healthy pregnancy and baby this time around.anyone else have this procedure then onto clomid with quick results? or just in general whats your experience with clomid. i have a friend that had this procedure done and then onto clomid- pregnant on 2nd cycle after surgery and is due in a few weeks now. so i have some hope and keeping my mind open to whatever comes my way. just greatful to be led to a doctor that is so caring and took my side pain seriously instead of brushing it off as pms symptom.

2505,hey everyone.a few days ago i was working out in the night and started feeling dizzy and getting fuzzyness so that at some points i couldn't even see anything except the fuzzyness. does anyone know why this would have happened? my day was pretty standard. workout in the morning, go to study, and workout again. i had the same amount of cals as i usually do, (1000) so i don't think it was that. i don't eat red meat very often, maybe once a fortnight? could that be a problem? also, i felt less dizzy after i had some sugar. so not sure on this one!thanks,skye.

2507,hi i'm 18 and i've had this red patch of skin about 4mm wide on the head of my penis ever since i can remember. i've noticed that the strength of the redness changes, some days it almost matches the rest of the skin but it seems to have got slightly larger over the years. it is not painful but is less sensitive than the rest of the head. i am in a long term sexual relationship and we are both sure we haven't got any sti's. i also have no history of skin conditions.should i be worried?cheers

2509,i have a friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer.    between the time she was diagnosed and had a lumpectomy the tumors had doubled in size.    she had positivee and negative nodes.    a couple of weeks later she had a port put in then soon after started chemo once every 3 weeks for a several months.    she was suppose to have a month off before she started radiation.    3 weeks after her last chemo the np at the surgeons office diagnosed her with shingles at her surgical site so she didn't start radiation.    10 days later she started having severe headaches, nausea and vomiting.    she went to the er and had a mri which shold numerous brain metastases and the oncologist said that it wasn't shimgles but cancer at her original site.    she had an lp which showed cancer in her spinal fluid.    i have never heard of breast cancer spreading this fast especially while on chemo.    can and does this happen?    would a mastectomy have helped?    all of her original scans were normal. it has only been7 months since original diagnosis and the doctors say she has a month or less left.
2510,i had an ablation a few months ago which they burned my av node out to correct my svt,vt,paroxsmal v-fib, pvc's... i have ehlers danlos syndrome as well. two weeks ago my ekg showed normal. but i went back a couple of days ago and the lady kept rerunning my ekg 6 times total and it kept saying (septal t wave changes are non specific) and( poor r wave progression) ? with a resting pulse rate of `138. i'm a 29 yr old female normal weight,and i thought i was out of the water. when the nurse practitioner saw me, she said your heart is normal and everything looks good. i never got to see the doctor.    but i somehow feel, she is wrong and have been waiting for the doctor to hopefully call me explaining it to me. he still hasnt called. my ekg was the same every time the woman ran it. in the past they always re ran it when something was wrong and, long before i had the surgery, one time they ran it four times, the doctor looked at me and said 'we are gonna have to keep a closer eye on you until we can get your surgery done so is there or isnt there something wrong. im tired alot and kinda short of breath easier but i just went through hip surgery and figured it was lack of movement. just kinda worried and cant get an answer
2511,i went in to my doctor for an annual check and when the results came back she told me i was exposed to the herpes virus at one point in my life. this is very very upsetting to me. i don't understand these results at all. she acted as if it was nothing and something that can be cleared up easily. here are the results please give me some clarification.hsv type 2-specific ab, igghsv 2 igg, type spec                                                    3.50 high                            indexnegative                 1.09note: negative indicates no antibodies detected to hsv-2. equivocal may suggest early infection. if clinically appropriate, retest at later date. positive indicates antibodies detected to hsv-2; coinfection with hsv-1 cannot be excluded without type specific testing.please help i'm so upset and confused! i trust her but this is very hard to take.

2514,i just joined this community today.    i was diagnosed with ms in april 2010.    my first symptoms showed up in january.    i woke up with my left side numb.    got in to see the dr. right away.i am on medication, but i have a difficult time keeping a good attitude.    i think i could figure things out if every day was the same!    however it is not.    it drives me crazy as i never know how each day will go.    will i be tired?    will my legs suddenly weigh 500 lbs each?    will i have tremors?    etc.    i really want to know how you keep a positive and upbeat attitude.thanks,naomi
2515,my husband has had a cold for about 10 days now.    the past 3 days, he has been coughing alot, even with prescribed cough syrup.    tonight he was coughing when i looked over and he was sitting limp and dispondent.    after about 30 seconds, he finally came around and says to me, what are you looking at?    what happened?    after discussing with him what i had just witnessed, he says that sometimes when he coughs so hard, he will pass out.    he felt a pain in his head just before he passed out and when he came to, his skin was gray, he was clammy, and his eyes were glazed.    after a few minutes, he was fine.    i am concerned about this and would like to know what happened to him.     thanks.
2516,i had unprotected vaginal sex with a woman of unknown status, i got this one sore on the tip of my penis, and another one on the side of my head. i think i may have it, because its happened before. the thing is the outbreaks usually last    about a month. i noticed my lesion yesterday, and it was as if sweat came out of the cut when i squeezed it. it was clear. my outbreak that i had before has lasted 5 weeks and counting. can anybody relate or help me?
2517,every so often, usually after sex and sometimes after a lot of masturbating, i get an abrasion on the same spot on the head of my penis.    the spot gets bruised and sore.    the spot gets red and sometimes expands for 5-7 days and heals if i don't masturbate or have sex in the meantime.    it looks like a rug burn and i usually shrug it off because i had been having sex or masturbating a lot.this time, the skin under my scrotum itches like crazy.    am i paranoid or is this something to worry about?    last time i was tested, i was negative for stis.
2518,my    period havent come    for 4 months, but around the time it should come; i go through the same symptoms, lower back pain, tenderness of the breast, etc can it be menopause. or do i need medical help should i visit my doctor.marlene    -    trinidad west indies

2521,i know there are many posts on here about topamax being prescribed for weight loss but now it's my turn loli recently started seeing a new dr in feb... the first thing she suggested was gastric bypass surgery, as i am 5'8 and 335lbs. at the end of my physical she said do you get migraines? and i said no so she said well let me give you a prescription for a migraine medication that can also have the effect of losing up to 100lbs at first i was cautious about it, but i took the prescription. i didn't fill it until just today, so i waited well over a month. i had my follow up appt today since i have high blood pressure and was put on hydro something or other lol for the past 5 weeks, and thankfully it's only slightly above rather then stage 1 of hypertension.back to the topamax, i have been researching it for a couple of hours now and i feel like i just wasted 30 bucks by having it filled because now i want nothing to do with it.i think the one issue i have is the case of the stupids i can deal with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and whatever else you want to throw at me in those terms but when it comes to speaking or having difficulty getting words out or concentrating, i am scared to death! i work on phones from time to time at my job and if i am having that issue and can't speak, there is going to be a problem...for those that have been on topamax for weightloss, do you feel that the side effects were worth it?i guess i will hold on to the pills, she prescribed 50mgs, twice a day...and wait to hear from others what their experience has been like...
2522,i was recently dx with ms.    i also have a low b12 level.    i have few symptoms of ms.

2523,have had pain for about seven years now and has resulted in loss of my job. its in the lower right side of abdomen, extemely severe at times. it is a constant pain never gone. mostly after being on my feet for a short period it starts to worsen. in the sitting position its mild and at times i get these lighting bolts of pain that shoot to the vagina area or lower right back some times down my right leg. have had several tests, blood, xrays, ultrasounds, cts with and without contrast all neg.or normal so they say its my weight. i have lost 78 lbs. and still no change. i can walk for about half an hour before it starts up then the burning starts up it can get extreme to where i'm doubling over. when it gets that bad its takes forever to stop, i have to lie flat on my back or flat on my stomach to relieve any of the pain. it is a constant pain, it just depends what i do to how bad it worsens. not much will take it away. all pain meds that i have been put on subsides it alittle but never goes away totally. the only time time in the past seven or so years it was gone was last fall when they did the ct and gave me dipprovan(i think) in the er. it wewnt away for four hours then back. i am at my wits end can't take much more. i have also had appendix out after rupturing four plus times and lots of adhisions and one c-section in 1990 and the dr. then removed built up scar tissue from the appendix surgery in late 70's.this discussion is related toright side abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.
2524,i could not find a forum for this type of question.    my question is ....is it possible for children to develop hypothyroidism if they were not born with it and if so what are the symptoms?    also there is family history with this disease.
2525,my 3 year old son has been diagnosed with polymicrogyria (no seizures though ) amongst other things like adhd, spd, speech delays, ibs, with even some autistic features. now we also had a baby that passed at birth from hydracephaley. we were told that it was so rare that it would never happen again. i'm just now finding out these two are linked. my husband has gram mall seizures ( a few every month ) but never been diagnosed epileptic. is this genetic through him because of his condition ? also, we have 2 more boys at home ( younger ) what are the odds that there could be something wrong with them as well?

2529,we have been ttc for 12 months and had an early pregnancy loss at 18 dpo 2 months ago. last cycle, i decided to start clomid as though i seem to ovulate reguarly, my doctor thinks that it's too late, usually around day 19.    so i started 25mg of clomid on days 5-9 and i o'd on day 16 which was great.    today i got a faint + on hpt which is 14 dpo.    as what happened last time though, i have been spotting for 3 days and it got heavier overnight.    this is such a confusing time and i feel like i am on an emotional roller coaster.    has anyone been through something similar and do they have any advice for how to deal with the worry of miscarriage?

2531,i am a 23 year old male, and have noticed that my sex drive has drastically decreased over the past few years.    not only is my drive lacking, but my performance has decreased a lot as well.    i never had a preblem in bed until about a little over a year i was with a female and suddenly lost my erection.    i wasn't too concerned at the time, only a bit embarassed, but didn't think much of it.    after that, i had the same thing happen with another partner.    ever since then, i've noticed that its hard to either maintain a full erection, or it doesn't seem like its fully erect.    i haven't had a partner for a few months now, and don't even have the urge to.    just a few years ago, sex was the only thing on my mind and i was always ready to go...just like a young male should be!    i am really concerned for the fact that i'm only 23 years old and already experiencing these problems!    is this common for males my age? is there anything that i can do to help with this issue??

2533,hi just saw a post from someone on the prevention forum that their labcorp panel 083824 came back positive and western blot indeterminate.    i got scared again because my tests were the exact same one at 5 and 12.5 weeks, both non-reactive.    my general doctor recommended me to test at 6 months, two weeks ago i went to see a hiv specialist in the castro district here in san francisco with dr. john nienow, md.    he said i don't need 6 month test, and the only reason for that test would be for a peace of mind and a u.s. cdc certified woohoo... one more month has gone by since my 88 day negative result and i'm still worried about possible infection, or should i do a different test and not using labcorp for my final 6 month test...please help to ease my mind again. thank you.

2537,hi doug,my question today is should steve continue to take the vytorin.    merck & schering-plough finally released the trial studies and    findings showing zetia, if i am interpreting the information correctly, is not the choice of drug for a patient that has genetics which cause abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol. please see excerpt from study released january 14, 2008.    also, of great concern, the note of fact that plaque build up in arteries was almost double.the new enhance trial -- which involved patients with a genetic condition that causes abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol -- found no such added benefit. according to a statement released by the two drug companies monday, researchers found no statistically significant difference in heart attacks or stroke among trial participants who took zetia plus zocor, a widely used cholesterol-lower drug, versus those who got zocor alone.the study also noted that the speed at which arteries thickened with plaque almost doubled among those on the two-drug regimen compared to those taking zocor alone.jeanne gwin

2556,a couple of weeks ago, one of my teeth got sensitive to cold.    it got to the point that drinking tap water or breathing in quickly would hurt.    it wouldn't last long, maybe a second at most.    it was still this way last night when i went to bed.    all of a sudden this morning, it was fine.    i even held ice cream against it tonight and there was no pain whatsoever.    just the slight discomfort of holding something really cold on your teeth.    i thought i might have had a leaky filing or a bad tooth but why would that just stop hurting all of a sudden?    what's going on?
2557,ok well i have known for a while the my boyfriend watches porn. about 6 months ago i saw on him email a receipt from a porn site. i said something and he freaked saying that he is too tight with his money he wouldn't do that. if he wanted that he could just get on his paltalk account. well come to find out last night i saw another receipt in his email and he has gone to that site a good bit. and its one of those chat sites, not even really porn. ?? but he doesn't stay for long, each session is about 2 or 3 mins long, no longer than that. so i mean he can't really be getting that into it for just 2 minutes. but it bothers me because he pays for 2 different sites, that i know of. one is the chat site and then the other one is acutally porn. but i feel like he looks at it all the time. i found another site saved in his favorites. i'm almost starting to feel like he would rather watch that by himself then be with me. it makes me feel like i'm not good enough. it would be different if i knew he didn't pay for it and that it wasn't the chat sites. that kinda bothers me a lot. i didn't sleep all night because of this. and he is the kind of person that if i bring up something he has done wrong he will get mad and it will start a huge fight. but he knows me and when something bothers me i just get quiet and not myself. i just don't know what to do or how to even bring it up. it hurts me a lot but i just don't think even if i say anything he will stop. someone please give me some advice!!!

2560,i had my first iui (clomid only; no trigger or prometrium) on the 15th. i know that implantation happens on day 5 or 6. yesterday i felt really 'odd'. i had, what i can only describe, as upper vaginal/cervical twinges. when i got home i was super, super, super tired where all i wanted to do was sleep. and then super crabby the last 2 days. i know that i'm probably just getting regular pms-symptoms but with the semen count of 50 million, part of me wonders could this really be it? would one get any pregnancy symptoms this early?i'm sure this is all in my head. my husband goes you never were pregnant so how would you know that it isn't true?i just don't want to get my hopes up. but this crabbiness is out of control. if i get af, i'm not due until the 31st.
2561,i have had chest tightening and feel like having to go to principals office...only happened when exercisinglast week did have ekg and stress test normal...but pushed for angiogram showed 99% blockage and placed stentbut now tightening and feeling all the time!!!anyone have any ideas???
2562,i am 63 yrs. have had angina/mi/angioplasty with 3 stents rca 1996. i had angina/angio with no stents in 1998, 2000, 2002. in 2004 another round of angina,mi, 2 more stents in rca. i now have full metal jacket in that artery. i have had no problems since. my concern at this moment is that i have had 6 bouts of angina in the last 5 evenings. it is the exact same as all the others, shortness of breath when lay down on left side, achy burning on inside of upper left arm and neck, jaw. it last until i take a nitro. so far 1 pill has worked. my blood pressure which has been low (110/70 or less) since a ovarian tumor surgery 4/2007, is now back up to 180/90 or higher and at the time of the angina it was 198/103but as soon as nitro worked, it was down to 135/75. i am on toprol xl (for high heart rate of 120 or above), venazepril, diuretic, fenofibrate, simvastatin, aspirin, lantus, glipizide. i have lost 30 lbs since nov. lipids are down to normal limits now and i have been walking for my back and sugar. why if i am on all the right meds and done all the right things is this starting again. what is the point? i don't want to go to the er again, nor do i want to go through the whole procedure again.the only nights without symptoms are the ones where i prop up in bed for 1-2hr before lying down. what do you suggest.
2563,hi! i am 38 years old. i am 5'7 and weigh 123 lbs. i exercise everyday and i am a high school teacher. i have been suffering from the following symptoms for the past 3 years : burping constantly after eatting, feeling of solid food getting stuck in my throat, sensation of excessive mucous in my throat after eatting. i basically use a juicer, eat smoothies and very soft foods. i feel like i have a 90 year old's diet!    i have been to ent and 2 different gastro dr's . i was told it was gerd and put on nexium 2's a day for 8 months with no relief. then, tried zengrid and prevacid with no relief. had upper endoscopy with dialation that helped for a few months, then symptoms returned. the second gastro dr. seemed at a loss as to why nexium would not work and why his dialation during endoscopy did not work. i am now seeing a different gastro dr who will do a motility test next week. i am well educated and not imagining these symptoms. i even had an ent tell me to just take a muscle relaxant to eat! this seems ridiculous, since i am able to eat soft foods and liquids.i am very frustrated that every doctor i see has a different opinion. do you have any advice? all of the gastro doctors seem frustrated that nexuim does not work. have you had other patients with these symptoms? the only medication i take is .88 levoxyl for thyroid. coincidentally, all of my issues stated 3 months after starting levoxyl. every dr. i have been to said it is not related, but i would like your opinion. thank you for your help!
2564,these boards have been very helpful and i would like to thank those for their helpfullness!i have developd a solid mass/nodule (5.7x3x3.7 on last u/s) with calcification taking up pretty much my whole left thyroid lobe.    i have three other small ones also, though, those were not biospied.    the biopsy came back benign but with follicular cells within it with the pathologist stating further investigation is warranted pending clinical appearance.    my internist had sent me to a surgeon urgently for a surgical consult for removal of my thyroid gland and the ent surgeon was hesitant and wanted to wait a month as he thought i had acute thyroiditis.    my internist very much disagreed.    i have had 2 ultrasounds, 1 ct scan w/contrast and now this week i am having a thyroid uptake to determine if it is a hot/cold/warm nodule.    my internist's office had called last friday and stated that when they retrieve the results of this scan they want to see me regarding seeking consultation from an endocrinology surgeon in another province (we don't have one).    i am not treated with any medications either.now my questions: could it be cancer even if it is a hot nodule?    is calcification that bad and does it always lead to cancer?    if the occurance is rapid does this lean towards cancer?    can an fna determine noncancer/cancer follicular cells?i know it is a lot of questions, but i just want to have some sort of sense before going back to the internist.thanks, and......merry christmas!
2565,my baby is 4 years old.    on friday evening after his bath, i noticed a rash in his face (very, very fine bumps).    upon further examination, i noticed that this rash was covering his trunk along with his arms and upper legs.    before he got in the bath, i did not notice any rashes, although i did not inspect him at the time.    the rash, at first, did not itch.    but now it seems to itch him.    what should i do?
2566,hello,i had posted question here a several times before and each time really helped me...i thanks you for then and.i thank you in advance.around dec. of last year i had a few unprotected oral sex with a street hookers.    we smoked coke and i recieved oral for a few hours.    that next day,    i felt this burning , tingling feeling that i had not felt before.    then i notice the rim of my penis turn red , with a few red spots.    i went to the clinic ,    and the doctor said everything looked normal, and all my tests were negative.    then a month later,    mid jan.    i noticed a small white bump on the bottom tip of my penis.    i tried to squeeze , pop, itch , and just made it worse.    there was a lil pus ..but hardly no liquid of any type....it got infected and turned really red and looked like a bad pimple, then in about a week..it disappeared leaving a tiny little black dot.    i then went to the clinic again...did all the test again...( negative)...and the doctor told me that everything was normal it was just the way my skin was.    relief!.around early feb.a month later     i noticed a red spot, on the bottom part of the head...right about the rim.    it wasn't even a bump because i couldn't feel anything. but it was fairly big...size of pen cap...maybe al lil smaller.     so for about a month i just had a red spot that was so slightly raised. sometimes you have to have the    light shine    to really see it..the red spot alone had this shine/glaze to it..     it didn't itch or hurt and had no feeling.    i was hoping this would just go away....but i have had this since it started and now it seems worse. now the red dot are really noticeable and when i masturbate i can even feel some sort of scab.     as i looked at it carefully it even seems like a lesion or blister.this last weeked i had a encounter for only oral sex which was unprotected.    then i did a lot of masturbating with lotion the burning and tingling feeling appeared again.    i would constatly look at my penis because there is some discomfort, i'm not sure if its burning or tingling, or it could be both....theres even some weird pain on the tip of the penis....and a stinging feeling on the shaft and seems like my testicles hurt too. today i spent about a hour examining my penis.....1.    that red spot thats been there for many weeks is now looking like a    lesion , blister.    2. the shaft of my penis when flacid has lots of wrinkled skin and when erect i noticed a few spots where the skin is gone. .    kinda like a eraser burn....or a ulcer but not discolored in any way.    could this be from masturbating...( i have noticed that my penis is sometimes dry and sticky. ).    3.    i feel burning/itching    on the penis.    i can't really pinpoint where the discomfort is coming from but when i'm sitting down , driving,    it feels like the whole penis has been dipped in ben gay.scary thought of having std's is taking over my days.    i would read 100's of post on the forums and i would read many articles online. i'm afraid that i caught something now.....i will go in to see the clinic again but wanted your advice and thoughts about this.     thanks
2567,i had a miscarriage on feb 16th, i believe that was the day cause it's the day i had heavy bleeding, clots, serious cramping, and i believe i passed the placenta this day. i stopped bleeding on the 26th of feb.    i got pms symtoms(symptoms)and started lightly bleeding on the 2nd of march.    is this my period or just leftover from the miscarriage.    it feels like a period. cramping, bloating, lower back pain. normal period symptoms.    any thoughts?...
2568,i'm 14 years old and my sister is 10 years old. we argue a lot but it seems like most of the time its always started by her. i do admit that i may start some but most of the time their caused by her. she talks to me like i'm stupid and thick, never says please and thank you to me when she wants something doing for herself. when i do tell her to say please to me, she answers me like this, why should i? my parents are absolutley sick of us arguing but i just feel like we both get told off but its always her fault and not my'n. because there are consequences for me when we argue, but she always manages to get what she wants by the end. i'm not sure what i should say to my parents about this because i want this blaming to stop and for them to realise what happens, because everytime i try and explain what happened during the arguement, they don't want to listen. any suggestions about how i should go about saying something? and why they don't see that its not me but her?thanks for any answers
2569,i    have chest pain level 10 intensity, today i had adobutamine echocardiogram and it showed nothing, however the dobutamine did make the pain appear and it took several hours for it to go away.    now cardio wants to do a thallium stress test what could this pain be from?this discussion is related toreaction during, and aftermath of a dobutamine stress test.
2570,hi there, newbie here... here's the background info:been on percocet pain pills for bad knees, one which i had surgery on, and the other i'm putting off for awhile.    i've been taking them for over 2 years.    a little less than a year ago, i started abusing them badly and worked up from 2 to 3 5mg. per day to up to 90mg (was taking 3 30mg of roxi or oxy or p30s, whatever i could get my hands on)... in the last couple of months i've been able to taper to 25 to 35 per day, but now my life is in shambles, specifically with finances, and i have to clear my head and get my drive and motivation back to get into the workforce again and take my life back.yesterday, i took my last 5mg (that's all i took) and it was at 1:00... today will be the first day without anything and i don't know what to expect.    i'm already starting to freak out a little bit, my body hurts, and i'm super 'touchy'. i feel like i could fly off the handle at anyone today.my question is, what should i be expecting over these next few days, and what can i do to alleviate symptoms as to not drive my entire family crazy.    i have 3 kids and i need to keep functioning with daily activities...thank you for your advice!
2571,i have had a stingy burning like pain under the nipple around the areola for quite some time. this week i developed a very sharp stinging pain that feels deep inside the left breast. i examined and found that there is a bruising type of sign under the nipple and an indentation. the stinging is very localized and very painful. my left breast is much larger than the right, always has been and when i am sitting at a table, the breast pushing against it, i can feel a aching there. there is    a pimple like mole that has developed also. any ideas?
2572,hi, i am 35 years old and have had 3 children, one has passed away due to congenital heart disease, which could have been due to my uterus. i have a bicornuate uterus-heart shaped-(which i just found out about, a small fibroid (2 cm), heavy long periods with a brown mucus discharge, painful intercourse, bad headaches during the end of my periods and horrible lower back pain. i went to my obgyn for several years with complaints and she never did tests or anything on me, so i just switched doctors and she have been running tests on me. the ultrasound showed heart shaped uterus and a fibroid. she also did a test to check for cancer which was negative. she said that i could possibly have endometriosis. she said my options are mirena (iud- used as birthcontrol) or a hysterectomy. the pill is out due to past issues with headaches and the pill. so we talked about trying the mirena first to see if that would help me, but i am have second thoughts about it. the more i read about it the more it makes me wonder. like it is mainly used for birth control, not problems with periods. i am not having any more children and my husband has had a vasectomy, so i don't need to worry about birth control. also does it work with a heart shaped uterus? then do i want to feel better for a few years then have the same problems again later with the same options? with the mirena it will make your periods heavier before they get lighter, what fun! has anyone else had the same problems or used a mirena for the same reasons? should i try the mirena first or just get a hysterectomy? thanks.. dsmegnky
2573,we took les to the hospital today to get a small port    for her pain meds and fluids.    i have finally came to terms with this , i am as prepared as possible. she is alert and they are keeping the pain down. i can see when it hits her, first her hands start to move around trying to scatter the pain, then she becomes very restless, then her face starts showing    how intense it is. the pain medicine only takes a few minutes to take affect, but it is enough for me to see how bad it is for her.    she sat for an hour holding hands with chris today, her brother with downs, that seemed to help, she is still eating solids and taking a stool softner daily.    we will take her home thur or fri,    her 3 brothers that have gone canoeing    up north called her today, when then found a hill they could use the cell from.    that seemed to help also, they will be home sunday. my car gave out on me today, some bolt let loose and the transmission fell down,    i had the cops and a wrecker to help me.    i will be staying all night with her 3 times a week from now on, at home, i only cry when i pass places in town that meant so much to us.    i do not want any one to feel sorry for me, and i am sorry to see that some of you    are hurting and some that are just starting this journey, it isn't all bad, there are many good days.    live every day to the fullest and laugh alot, les and i laughed today and it felt so good.     more later    marty
2574,i have this pain under my rib at times it is sharp and at times it is dull, cannot figure out whatit is?
2575,i haven't posted in a very long time. don't seem to be getting any better. pain meds keep pain almost manageable, as long as i don't get too active.but that's not why i am posting today.my cousin ervin passed away 3 weeks ago. he lived with ms for 18 years. he was diagnosed at the age of 48, and it advanced quickly, long before any of the new treatments could help him. he was in a wheelchair within 4 years of his dx.i don't know why i am telling all of you, except maybe to encourage you never to give up.i believe he survived so long because his wife and children and grandchildren gave him the will to live.a few of us in the family got together on easter and that day, there were no tears. we shared happy memories of his life.still, he is sadly missed.hugs,sheila
2576,my dr. put me on topamax... for migranes(migraines), but also for weightloss... he says it will really kick in and start helping me shed weight once i get up to the 150-200mg mark. i am currently on 100mg's/day and will increase to 150mgs by the weeks end...then 200mg's by the following week...anyone else use this drug and what are your experiances at the different dosage levels? i have no headaches at all which i love... no side effects except for an occasional slight tingly feeling in my heels of my foot... but its very very mild and very unnoticable.(may not even be related...who knows)but anyway, if anyone has any input to offer, that would be awesome.anyone lose any good amount of weight? if so, how much and in what time frame?i notice a big decrese in my appetite already... pretty much have to force myself to eat cause i am never hungry which is nice.... wonder what will happen as the dosage goes up even more?thanks!

2580,last week i started feeling sick. i had a sore scratchy throat and then begin with a cough, runny nose, and fatigue. i assumed i was just coming down with a cold. after a couple days my throat really began to hurt and i looked at the back of my throat in the mirror    and saw some swelling and red bumps, plus a lot of post nasal drip.i was worried it may be strep but almost everything i have seen online tells me it is not strep.no it is a week later and i am feeling much better. i still have some post nasal drip when i wake up. the only thing that is really bothering me is my throat. it is not sore it just feels like their is a golf ball on the left side. i still see the red dots to and their is some swollen portion on the left side. i am unsure what i should do. i don't have insurance and do not want to go in if it is just something i need to let pass. but i am worried it could be serious.
2581,just a bit of background information. i was 15, and a pretty hardcore lifter. i lifted weights 6 days a week, used professional bodybuilder workout plans. 4-5 workouts per body part, and i hit them pretty heavy. i had a 3-4 % body fat and was extremely fit for my age. it all came with a cost, i was at a local gym and my lung collapsed during chest training. doctor told me to wait a month, then continue with lifting. i did as they said. everything was fine...then 4 months later it hits again. this time the doctors are concerned on why my lungs aren't healing correctly. ive been out of lifting for 4 months now, and am no longer physically active. one doctor recommended surgery, other said it was too risky. i have not had any pressure or pain of the lungs in about 3-4 weeks. i really want to get back into lifting and being as physically fit as possible. how can i do this?

2585,i have had genital warts for a few months now and it is finally setting in. the doctor's have frozen a few of the warts off and need to have a couple more removed. my question is though, can you transfer gential(genital)warts to other parts of your body?? any help or support would be greatly appreciated. any other things i can do to help get rid of these dang things??? i have a gf and want to make sure that she is not infected. i look forward to a response.
2586,hi.    this is the third time in the past year that i have gone cold turkey off of klonopin.    each time the dose that i withdrew from has been less....first time, 3 mg, second time, 2 mg, this time, 1 mg    each time the first several weeks are agonizing, but the end result lasts for many months at a time.    the only reason i went back on klonopin at a lower dose, with a doctor, has been major external stressors, post traumatic stress disorder to be exact due to an abusive relationship.    now, the withdrawal symptoms are much easier to handle than the first few times, but still difficult to get through.    do you have any suggestions for staying off of klonopin for good without going back to my prescribed dose first?
2587,has anyone received alimta chemo for ovca?my mom is beginning this new drug next tuesday and im very curious on its success rate and side affects.at this point we have pretty much tried everything.    her last regimen was weekly taxol which only lasted 2 months until the ca-125 jumped up and became symptomatic.thank youfiana
2588,today when i went to my doctor he said that there are 5 follicles, and that therem is a risk of multiple births but then said if there was 3 they had to do reduction. i was given ovidril today and the nurses said it would cause me to release 5 eggs,we decided to do intercourse instead of iui because of the increased risk, i guess my question is...has anyone released 5 eggs at once and not fertilized them all. i'm not even pregnant yet and now i;m all worried my doctor is going to make me reduce if i have more than 3. any advice????
2589,http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/07/12105658-team-romney-rnc-announce-raising-nearly-77-million-in-may?litejust hours after the obama campaign announced that it, the democratic national committee, and other obama-related committees had raked in $60 million in may, team romney said they one-upped them.their romney campaign/republican national committee haul: $76.8 million. they also reported having a combined $107 million in the bank for all of their committees.  we are encouraged by the financial support from a broad range of voters, romney victory national finance chairman spencer zwick said in a statement. voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country.  but if the financial reports from april are any indication, much of that nearly $77 million is coming in the form of big five-figure checks from large donors.around this same time last month, the romney camp and rnc reported raising a combined $40 million. but when we saw the actual federal election committee filings, it was $11.7 million for the campaign, $11.4 million for the rnc, and the rest -- $17 million -- for the romney victory fund.the romney victory fund -- which also includes coordination with the state gops of id, ma, ok, and vt -- is the mechanism that allows donors to contribute up to $75,000 each. in mid-may, both mitt romney and his wife each contributed $75,000 to the victory fund.there is also an obama victory fund, which allows large donors to cut equally big checks. but when team obama announced raising $43.6 in april, the fec filings later showed that the campaign raised $25.7 million, the dnc raised $14.3 million, although nearly half of that dnc money came from a transfer from the obama victory fund.(when team obama collects large checks, the first $5,000 go to the campaign, which is the individual maximum; $30,800 go to the dnc, which is the max; and the rest go to the other committees.)we will not be able to get a campaign vs. campaign or party vs. party comparison on these numbers until june 20, when fec reports for may are due

2591,about 2 years ago i had an ovarian cyst on my left ovary that leaked into my abdomen causing intense pain. my ob/gyn monitored the size of the cyst for about a month with little change. again the cyst leaked and this time my ob/gyn told me to meet him at the hospital to do immediate surgery to drain the cyst. when i woke from surgery my doctor informed me that i did in fact have endometriosis. he immediately put me on depo provera and i remained on that for close to a year then i switched over to a seasonal birth control. i got my period once every 3 months. recently, with in the last 3-4 months, i opted to go off of birth control and hopefully manage my symptoms with naproxen.i get relatively bad cramps and lower back pain around my period and i have had some occurrences of pain during intercourse if i am close to my period. i guess after i was diagnosed i never really read up much on the actual cause and complications of endometriosis. (my sister worries more about me having it then i do).i definatly want to have kids one day, i'm only 22, but birth control makes me feel like i am a crazy person. does anyone have any other remedies or medications that have worked to keep endometriosis from advancing.also when i was diagnosed my doctor never gave me a stage. i am going to see him mid february so i will ask him if he knows my stage then and if the stage can effect the effects of endometriosis.

2594,i am a 24 year olds, very athleti(so i sweat a lot). about 2 weeks ago i noticed a few really really small bumps on the shaft of my penis and thought nothing of it, then about five days ago the bumps got bigger and look like pimples with white caps but are almost impossible to pop. they are hard at the cap, and now i have 8 of them instead of 3. they are not on the head only the foreskin and shaft, they are not clustered but not verfy far apart. i have had the same partner for the last 3 months and she had a std test come back negaitve just last week. i am circumsized and am rather acne prone around my thighs and back. i have a docters appointment for tomorrow but any information might help me sleep tonight. thanks
2595,over the past few months i've had constipation frequently. fortunately, bowel movement always resumed within 1-2 weeks. recently, i got constipated once again. through the past three weeks i've been constipated. sometimes i would get some bowel movement, but then i would be constipated once more within a day. this went on until the middle of last week. that was when i began to get diarrhea. i got the urge to use the restroom often during the school day but was often forced to simply ignore because we are busy in all my classes getting school work turned in and studying for exams, so i went to the bathroom when i got home. on saturday (yesterday) my diarrhea began to turn from typical to very watery. it also burned quite a bit as i used the restroom. coloration, however remained dark. i would say that i used the restroom about once every thirty minutes to an hour and was not comfortable getting too far away from the toilet seat. also it should be noted that after every bathroom run i still felt as if i needed to use the restroom but couldn't, almost as if there was some type of blockage or still some constipation. today i continued to follow this pattern however the coloration of my stool liquid lightened significantly, from a dark color almost to a tan. also i noticed that it wasn't nearly as acidic. in addition to this i suffered from severe gas all day. even now my abdomen continues to rumble. at one point during the day i could not release the pressure building up in my abdomen and i had sharp gas pains in my abdomen. i struggled to pass gas and could even feel the gas bubble sliding down and then moving back up as i applied and released preassure. also just a side note, i did not use the restroom nearly as often today, maybe only five or six times. i am bewildered by this entire occurrence and    really don't know what to think. please enlighten me.

2601,i have a large blister right inside the lips of my vagina, its mostly white, and it only hurts when i touch it, like after wiping when using the restroom. i didn't even notice it when my husband and i were intimate.. i have no idea what it is and i've never had anything like it before... please help.. what could it be??
2602,my husband is a 29 year old african american who has been experiencing serious episodes that are occuring in clusters.    by this, i mean that last year about 7-9 months ago, he experienced symptoms for a few weeks.    it starts by him feeling more tired than usual, then he'll start having muscle pain, headaches.    what eventualy happens then are the episodes, his back pain gets intense, intense chest pain, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, numbness and weakness in all of his limbs, cold/numb mouth, red blooshot eyes, headache, blurry vision.    also about 6 months ago, he developed a lingering cough.    after an episode he is not himself at all, meaning fatigue, achy, frequent pangs in chest.    after a couple weeks (i don't remember how many times he got the attacks) the symptoms went away.    his cough developed but nothing else until a couple weeks ago; he's been extremely tired lately then last week he had two of the attacks.    during the second and last attack he had, i took him to the er.    they didn't find much but did find elevated cpk results (530), slightly high urine ph (7.5), slightly low lymphocytes (23).    other than this, he has a slightly low heartbeat according to an ekg.    we were fortunate enough to see a cardiologist today, they don't think it's related to his heart based on these and other results from the er, however they are doing one last ekcocardiogram.    he thinks we should try neurology as well and agrees that it's only persistence that will find us an answer.
2603,my 14 yr old daughter has always had discharge ever since she started her menstrual cycle. i have not yet taken her to a dr. cause i think it can be normal in women. the discharge is a odorless    white & thick she always has to have a pad on at all times. is this normal or should i take her to a dr. last note she still is a virgin so a disease would be ruled out.
2604,okay well, lets start with my foot. okay so in soccer last wednesday i had soccer, and well there's this girl with a really big kick, and i was a forward and she was defense and we both went after the ball, and i got to it first she was about to kick when i passed it and, she kicked the top of my foot really hard and instantly it hurt to walk&run on it. and its been hurting ever since, it hurts to touch it, and sometimes it hurts to walk on it. what do i do? i already told my mom&dad, but they didn't really care, they just said okay.and now my knee, i don't know why, but my knees are weak after soccer and my right hurts more. and when i walk or run it hurts and i dont know why.?

2606,my father is in his 80's. he is having hot buring pain and tingleing in his arms and upper chest area - kinda like a hot flash. they only last a minute or two but make his shakey(shaky)and weak. what is this?
2607,my father is 95 and has been in generally good health.    he has been getting tired easily but all of a sudden he can't wake up.    he barely stays awake to eat and then goes right to bed.    he isn't just resting, this is a deep sleep.     it's very hard to wake him up but when i do, he just tries to focus and then goes back to sleep.everyone says he's just getting old but there has to be an actual reason for this.
2608,i barely sleep..all i wanna do is curl up in a ball and cry......sometimes i wish my kids would be better off without me....i never know what to do...i wait till everyone is asleep and i just cry.....
2609,i am 26yo and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about 3yrs ago. that was a very dark period in my life because i had been going through all kinds of moodswings and irritability. i was in and out of hospitals and doctor offices, only to be told that i had anxiety. at first i thought i did because i was very stressed out but the way i was acting, i knew that it wasn't my normal self. i really wish that i could explain how hopeless and clueless and sad i felt. life seemed really cold and dark to me, i became deeply depressed. it seemed like i had no one to turn to.i remember one day i was sitting down at home on the computer and all of a sudden, my heart started beating so fast. i immediately called 911 because i thought that i was having a heart attack (i didn't know at the time that your heart stops beating if it's a heart attack because i was clueless about what it was) i was scared out of my mind. anyway, i was taken to the er and to make a long story short, they was so interested in me taking drugs tests instead of trying to help calm my nerves and fears. from what i remember, my heart beats were about 160. as i now am aware, that's kinda high, but i remember a nurse telling me that day that at my age i could handle it. i remember pulling off those chest stickers and walked out.if only i had known better, i would have stayed and let them (if they would have) run some thorough tests to see what the problem was, i would probably have saved myself more suffering and feel better today.so, to fast forward to today. i eventually ended up receiving a rai 131 scan to confirm hyperthyroid. the results said that after 24 hours, i had an uptake of 83%, which confirmed graves diseases. i was put on methimazole, which made me itch all over and become more irritated. i then started taking benadryl, which made me so tired. my life was a mess. i couldn't function for school or work. i'm telling you, this disease had (and still do)me on some kind of bodily roller coaster.the doctor that i have been seeing for this condition is not an endocrinologist and had little knowledge of this condition. it's unfortunate that i had no way to see an endocrinologist because my insurance don't cover specialty care. however, i'm at the point that i'm willing to go into debt because of my health. right now, i'm really interested in a natural approach to stopping this dis-ease.i really hope someone has taken the time to read what i wrote up to this point but if not, i will not stop trying to get to the bottom of what's causing my condition. i know that it doesn't run in my family and so, it had to be something wrong i did internally. i've read that stress could trigger this condition, and it makes me wonder if it's the reason as i was robbed not even a year before my symptoms surfaced. i have also had a root canal done, which have been giving me problems since.some info about what medications i taking now is methamizole 10mg about 4 times a day. my tsh is 0.05, t4 is 8.5, t3 is 0.93--i try to limit meals with too much sodium and drink plenty of water. oh, and eat more fruits and veggies. i really don't know what else to do besides this.someone please give me some kind of advice about what to do, or referrals to holistic, natural doctors that have expertise with this condition. please!here are some of my lab results up to this point:9-24-2007 tsh ~0.01 (sadly, my first primary care doctor never told me about an abnormal reading when i was tested prior to this one. she said because of my age, she thought i'd work itself out)12-27-2007 tsh~0.05, free t4~1.359-04-2009 tsh~0.05, t4~ 8.0, t3~0.93, wbc~ 9.86, rbc~ 5.55, hgb~ 15.1, platelet count 2529-20-2009 tsh~ 0.05, t3~pending, t4~ 8.5, glucose 78

2611,i have celiacs.    i sometimes have mucus coming from my rectum and also vagina (at different times). its clear in color, real slimey kinda like when you blow your nose. i dont have it on a regular basis, but i have been noticing it more often lately.    could this have something to do with celiacs or does it sound like something else? what should i ask my doctor to test?    it seems when i finally get in to see my doctor, my problem is gone.    im hoping this is nothing too serious.    my medical conditions are: diabetic, thyroid & celiacs.
2612,hi every1. i am sooooo sad today. well im in my tww but i have absolutely no hope cuz i went for a pap today and i got some crazy problems. i had acidentally been kneed in the croch a couple yrs ago and i got this lump down there. i went to drs. after that and they never said anything about it. i didnt go specifically for that but they seen it and asked about it then completely ignored it. even the dr. that did my iui seen it and said it wouldnt affect me getting pg. but now my new dr. seen it and says its abnormal and needs to be checkd so i gota go to my obgyn and they are gona check it and drain it if needed. anyway, i asked my dr if it being there can afect be getin pg and she said it could. cuz if its infected or anything then my cm might not be sperm freindly since its probly tryin to kill any foren bodies or something. i didnt explain that right im sure but hopefully you all no what i mean. so im in another tww with no hope of being pg cuz of a problem that 2 previous drs. ignored. i feel like i shoulda pushed for it to be checked but at the same time they made me feel like nothin was rong with that being there. well on the bright side i can ttc again after they drain it as long as nothin else goes rong. im just so sad and im sory for wasting a thred but i needed to vent :( i got no1 else to talk to.    dh is at work..figher fighter so he wont be home till tomarow..you can use this for an open forum and if any1 else wants to vent go ahead and do so here. :)
2613,i have fibroids on my appendix. the fibroids were removed at one point, but not the appendixes. today they still hurt, but for financial reasons i can't get them removed. my daughter crawled in bed with us last night and accidentally kicked me in the appendix. it hurts so bad. i'm not mad at her, but ouch! i worry about them rupturing, but so far the only problem seems to be chronic pain. i just don't know how long i can keep using my appendix. i'm also not 100% sure it's my appendix that hurts right now, it could be my endo or a cyst.
2614,hi everyone. my ds is 6 1/2 months old and has slept through the night(6 hours) maybe 5 times. he wakes up about 3 times during the night. he always wakes up 40 mins after he 1st goes to sleep. tonight he woke up at 9:30 and didn't go back until 11pm! i was just wondering if anyone else has been through this? it would make me feel so much better to hear that this does happen with other babies instead of thinking that my baby has a major sleep disorder. thanks for listening.
2615,i was recently tested for hsv 1-2.. the results came back positive for hsv 1. now about 3 months ago i had some itching on my penis from 2 bumps and the doc said it was folliculitis. he prescribe me some antibiotics and also gave me a shot on the spot, in a week or so the symptoms went away. that's until about a week ago.. the same symptoms recurred but this time the tiny bumps, pimple-like.. were resemblance of a rash near the exact spot of the last outbreak, itching. that's what lead me to further get tested.to further describe the bumps.. they are pimple-like.. and when viewed closer i can see very thin hairs stemming from the center of the bump and they itch. once the itching stops they bust and begin to heal, sort of resembling a dimple, little hole in the middle, and the scab over.thanks for any help.
2616,i thought acyclovir was supposed to keep me from getting outbreaks so close together but i was at the end of an outbreak when i started on 400mg acyclovir 3x a day for 10 days but i just finished 3 days ago and im already having another outbreak, whats going on?
2617,i was diagnosed with multiple mental health disorders including bipolar2, depression, personality disorder and a few more.    i also recently got myself an internist instead of going to my family physician, as my list is much more than he could handle. there was also a conflict of personality as he actually said that i am manipulative and a liar.    has anyone had similar or exact experiences and did i make a good call in getting an internist?
2618,my 4 year old daughter exhibits strong emotional mood swings. she has fantastic moments in which she is polite, attentive and considerate. the other side of those are emotional outburts (meltdowns) usually triggered by a request from either parent or an argument over what's mine with her younger sister. generally, she is very bright and seems to pick up quickly to new challanges. what scares us as parents are the depth and frequency of the outbursts in addition to how very sensitive she is to everything around her, good and bad.    should we be seeking outside advice to help us deal with these issues? what can we do as parents to help identify the root of the problem?
2619,i've been on kapidex for about 6 weeks and constantly have headaches.    if i skip a dose, no headache.    a co-worker who started taking it a few weeks ago is experiencing headaches, as well.is there another similar medicaton that has fewer side effects?
2620,hey i've been taking clonazpam (klonopin) occasionally and i want to know if i have a chance of going through withdrawal or building tolerance.i take clonazepam 1 or 2 times a week (1 mg each time). i take it no more than 6 times per month. i wait three full days in between taking another dose.i had 1 mg last night so i will wait until at least saturday to have another 1mg.will this cause tolerance or even worse withdrawal? because i am deathly afraid it will.any help would be greatly appreciated.

2622,hii missed my period for over 3 month now. my period is never ontime n very irregular. in the last month i have experianced a lot of pregnancy symptoms. i had a very sharp pain on my left side. it lasted a whole night. i stared getting a lot of head aches, then i noticed my urine was bright yellow. i noticed there was a lot of white discharge down there! more than normal! after i started feeling naseous during the night..sometimes in the morning too. my lower back is killing me. i gained a lot of weight within the last month too. my eting habit changed a lot. i feel like im hungry again after like an hour. havent really been eating much throughout the day so i thought it was because of that. my aereola is a bit darker and my boobs are a lot bigger. not really getting much pain in them but certain things i do i notice they are a little sore. i took 2 pregnancy tests but they were all negative. i have an dr apt next week. i was wondering if it could be anything else besides pregnancy? i dont think im stressed because im really happy with everythin in my life right now and how things are goin for me. am i just pregnant or could it be something else?

2624,hello,i have not been diagnosed yet with anything but my gyn is sending me for a tvus tomorrow after months of pain and crazy symptoms.    i am 27, turning 28 next month.starting back in march, i had intense pelvic pain that came and went (very sharp  thought it might be appendicitis but then it went away a couple of hours later and i didn  t seek treatment for it).    over the next few months, just very tired, intermittent random sharp pains on right side, sometimes low in the pelvic area other times higher up by my rib cage, bloated, feel disgusting after eating, cramps and diarrhea, sometimes pain during intercourse  does not seem to have any obvious triggers.    pain was very bad one night in july, woke me up in the middle of the night, and husband took me to the er  they tested me for appendicitis and kidney stones with at cat scan, everything came back okay, but they told me i had a tumor on my liver and to follow up with pcp.    pcp did liver function blood tests and sent me for an mri (all the while telling me that he thinks i have ibs but he needs to rule out everything else before making that official diagnosis).    blood work came back normal, mri showed liver hemangioma which doc says could not be causing my pain and i should not worry about it, but will have to have another mri done in a year to make sure it has not changed at all.    the entire month of july i felt sick every single day, husband and i took a weekend trip to chicago, on the ride there i thought we might have to pull over and find a hospital because the pain in my lower back and right side was so intense and i felt very sick (lightheaded, nauseous).    symptoms came and went.    pcp told me to see my gyn.    saw gyn, did pap (came back fine), pelvic exam, she said everything felt ok during pelvic exam, but i was in a lot of pain during it, especially when she pressed on area right below where she said my ovaries are.    she ordered the tvus which i am having done tomorrow.    she seemed generally unconcerned about my symptoms due to my age.two weeks ago i started having chest pains, shooting pain in my neck and shoulders (have had this issue before, last year, pcp sent me to a cardiologist who did a full work up and told me i was fine but i might or might not have small vessel disease, so basically he told me nothing) and went to the er where i had an episode while hooked up the monitor heart rate went up to 180 in about a minute while i was just sitting there, felt like i was going to pass out, doctor and nurses ran in, stuck an oxygen tube up my nose, gave me meds through iv to stop me from shaking, the whole thing was extremely scary.    they admitted me to the hospital, kept me on heart monitor, did blood work, and an echocardiogram, told me i am suffering from svt episodes and put me on a daily beta blocker (which drops by bp low so now i have to worry about not passing out).    released me after 3 nights, now i have a follow up appointment on nov 1st with the cardiologist.    beta blockers seem to be helping so far, just have to watch my bp and make sure i keep my fluid intake up and eat enough.i was just getting over the svt hospital stay when last week, on wednesday night, i woke up with intense pain on my left side, low abdomen area, not quite ovarian area, more to the outer left side.    was shaky and sweaty, husband took me to the er.    told them i was ordered a pelvic u/s by my gyn that i had not had yet, they told me it was too late at night for the u/s, so the doctor (who was male and seemed dismissive) sent me for a cat scan to look for kidney stones, which came back fine, but they said they found a little bacteria in urine and i had a slight uti (doctors exact words were very dismissively   i don  t know what that is about, we  ll give you some antibiotics).    gave me antibiotics through iv, discharged me, husband had to pull over on the way home from hospital because the meds made me sick.    oh and the er nurse also blew out my vein while trying to take blood (went and got a 2nd nurse who did it fine without any problems).    needless to say that er visit was a nightmare.so now i  m sitting at my desk at work with dull constant pain on the right side, thinking to myself that it  s probably nothing (since that is what they tell me at the er usually) but also i worry,   well what if one of these times it is my appendix and i ignore it?  all of this these past six months has been extremely emotionally draining.    the pelvic/abdominal pain is scary enough, and so frustrating that i do not have a diagnosis, and now also dealing with the svt and heart episodes.    my job has not been understanding and basically told me if i didn  t apply for fmla i would be fired.    my husband has been great and very supportive, but i know he feels the burden too of all of this and trys to be strong for me.i don  t know what i want to happen tomorrow  i  m almost hoping that the tvus finds something so that i have an answer as to what is causing all of these problems.    on the other hand, i don  t want it to find anything.    hopefully if it does find something it isn  t something too serious (cysts) and can be treated easily.    i know that ovca is rare in women my age (at least that is what people tell me).    if it finds nothing then i have to see a gi specialist and undergo more tests.    i just want answers, tired of not being taken seriously, tired of missing time from work, tired of worrying, tired of doctors and hospitals, tired of feeling like i'm nuts.     every day i have some sort of pain, whether it is dull and achy, sharp and stabbing, etc.    i  m so scared that someday i  m just going to drop dead because i have some condition that has gone undiagnosed.thanks for listening.    wondering if any of you ladies had any similar experiences or pain like mine, or if any of you are around my age?
2625,to everyone that experiences sleep paralysis, i have read all of your post and i wanted to share my experie nce with yours.first, it always happens to me in the afternoon, i have never felt it at night time. i love napping and today i had a horrible migraine and i just wanted to lay down for a little bit. i can always feel it when is coming and i try waking up. it feels like somone injecting me with anethesia and you trying to fight it.i usually feel someone laying behind me and i start to feel goosepumps all over my body. i can also hear voices but i dont know what they r saying.the room temperature becomes really really cold and i start to pray but the noises become louder,now my question is why is it, that when    my dog slept with me it never happen. and the times that has happen my dog is not around, my dog passed away about 2 weeks ago and now im experiencing it    frequently.ps: i can swear to you i felt people screaming from hell. i felt agony and when i finally got my body to move i started to cry... my migraine is worst.thfank you
2626,i have had my symptoms for 8yrs now. have seen several doctors and yet to come up with a proper diagnosis. i have severe pain that runs through the central nervous system of my body. it never affects the same area each time i have an outbreak of a rash. although over the 8 yrs. it has been in the same place more than once. first i have severe pain either in my head or leg or shoulders or arms or hand or ankle. then 2to 3 days a rash appears either across my tail bone in a horse shoe shape with swelling and inflamation(inflammation), or on my wrist,face,knee area,or head and neck. it used to run with my mensus cycle so i hoped and prayed after menopause it would go away. i am now 2 yrs. post and still having all the pain and symptoms. i have been told spider bite on my first diagnosis. then shingles,then fibromyalgia,then one dr. told me i was crazy in so many words. i went to see a specialist in chronic disease and he ran blood tests and to no avail. i'm really weary from the pain and the outbreaks.
2627,okay.i'm 16.and have been with my partner for almost a year.i'm on the pill.and our...intamicy is 80% protective as in condoms.but for the past week    i've been having this like brown discharge stuff.??i dont know what it is. but the first to days it was like blood?im really confused i had my last period about 3 weeks ago, and my next one should be coming sometime next week. i dont know waht it is and.i just would like some help please.
2628,i'm not stranger to ovarian cysts. big ovarian cysts. the other night when i went to the er and had an u/s done, they discovered ovarian cysts on both ovaries, the gall bladder looked normal, and most importantly....the gestational and yolk sacs were in the uterus not in the the tubes. since i had that u/s, the pain has worsened and lowered. it is in the area of my ovaries and much lower into the pelvic area. this pain now feels like i've been sucker punched 100 times in that area. very tender. it feels different (worse) than the pain i've felt with cysts in the past.my ob had my betas drawn yesterday as a follow up to my er visit, but i didn't see him to mention the pains. i'm wondering if something worse is going on (though i'm not sure what it would be) or if i'm just feeling particularly ouchy from the vaginal u/s poking around in there. or maybe this is normal for a 2nd pregnancy fresh after surgery. not sure. any insight?i feel like one of those psycho posters that posts the same thing 10 times just to get an answer. really, i'm not. lol
2629,for the last 5 weeks i have had a redness on the tip of my penis on both sides which seems to get worse if it gets rubbed or after a shower.    about 2 weeks ago near the area i developed small brown marks which look like bruises also on both sides, not too noticeable but they are to me.    i went in for std testing after the oral sex incident which was right before the redness started showing up and all results came back (-) but hsv wasnt tested.    i went to the doctor this week and had him look at what i am describing and he said it may be from physical activity or such and said he doesnt think it is anything and not to worry.    there was aslo some redness below the redness on the tip leading into the shaft.    i havent had any pain, blisters etc... no burning during urination although a couple weeks ago i amy have felt the urge to urinate more often for some reason.    any idea on what this could be and why it is lasting so long?    this would now be 1 month and 1 week with symptoms and it is driving me completely crazy and greatly effecting me.
2630,my husband went to the urologist for routine prostate check and was found to have microscopic hematuria...the doctor is now sending him for a whole battery of tests...ct, ivp, ultrasound, cystoscopy etc.    our insurance is so-sp and we have a 2 week vacation planned in one month.    he did not tell the doctor about the insurance or the vacation..my husband does not take this type of information very well,    this has hit him like a brick wall and i know there are many benign explanations for this microscopic blood... he is depressed and hasn't had one test yet.the prostate was fine...how should we handle this situation?    should i call the doctor and explain his state

2637,hii was diagnosed with borderline ovarian cancer---it is not a mucinous or serous, it is a    endometriod(sorry spelling)cell after removal of my left ovary.    it was only 1 cm and missed by 2 pathologist but then diagnosised by a university hospital, i went as saw a gyn/onc who sent it to john hopkins that actually almost missed it, but confirmed the diagnosis.    you get alot of mixed imformation about this diagnosis and part of me feels that having a hysterectomy is going over board, but there is no studies out there about just observing it and how many get it back if they don't have the hysterectomy.i have some people say i wouldn't have a hysterectomy---you will never be the same again---sex, orgasm, memory problems, mood swings.i know i am fortuanate that this is not actual invasive ovarian cancer---and i feel blessed that i don't have that.    i actually went on another web site for ovarian cancer and the women there actually were telling me i was self center and should be thankful that i am alive.    please don't get me wrong i am thankful and i think god has bless me, but i am so afraid of surgical menopause what it will do to me---i have 3 kids under 5 years of age!i guess i just want to hear that just like childbirth that things are not quite physically but still things work. does that make sense?thanx for listen

2640,hello!over the past few years, i have begun to eat in my sleep.    this started off to be a rarity or a fluke about 3-4 years ago but as of recently it's become more frequent ie a few times a week. i'm also experiencing nightmares and dialing the phone in my sleep and bad headaches.my biggest concern is the eating in my sleep because it can cause me harm if it gets worse. this started off as a joke or a minor irratation and now it's embarrassing and makes me feel like a pig.    i'm also always exhausted because of not ever getting a good night sleep or feel well rested.i frequently will remember waking up in the middle of the night but not remember why i ate what i choose or going back to sleep.    my snacks are often chips, or salty crunchy items and a lot of them, ie a half bag. if there is left over pizza or mexican food i am likely to eat that. i've gotten up in the morning still with food in my mouth and have found snacks in my bed or empty bags of snacks on my floor. i've tried to not keep the food in the house or hide it or create obstacles like shutting the door to my bedroom or child proofing a cabinet and it doesn't seem to work.    do you have any advice?    if i keep up like this, i'll never fit into my wedding gown! or keep my job!thanks!
2641,i am a mother of 4 my first ultrasound on 2/22 and all was a empty sac my lmp 12/28 could it b early
2642,i have also expirenced cataplexy for years.    it started at about age 11-13 and mainly only occured during extreem laughter.    i actually thought i must be weird or stupid so i never really started talking about it to doctors until i found out it was a symptom of narcolepsy.    i was sent to a sleep doctor and did a sleep study and they ruled out narcolepsy.    basically, the sleep specialist doctor told me i dont know why you would have cataplexy if you dont have narcolepsy and i felt like she was implying that im making it up or something.    yeah like i would make up something that weird or like i would even know something like that existed if i wasnt experiencing it.    it can be very scary. so, no one ever followed up with me.    i get it sometimes when im sleeping too like all of a sudden im conscious but i cant move and i even feel like im dying in my sleep because its so paralyzing.    i had a recent episode this morning that reminded me of all the times this has happened to me in the past.    i just got up from bed to let the cat out of the bedroom because he was scratching on the door to wake me up.    i got up, went to the door, opened it, let the cat out, shut the door and then i lost all function in my body, went paralyzed and fell to the floor and broke a statue sitting on the dresser that i hit on the way down.    it only lasted a second but it can be so stressful not to know whats wrong with me.    its also stressful to have all the doctors i have talked to about it tell me that im crazy or just dismiss it like nothing is wrong with that.    so my question is do i follow up with this or just dismiss it?    i dont have the money to keep throwing away on doctors that ignore me.this discussion is related tocataplexy without narcolepsy.
2643,since yesterday i have been having abdomanl pain thats not going away. i plan on calling my dcotro tomorrow. any insight from anyone as to what it could be would be appreciated. i had a vbac on monday. i know in my discharge instructions it says to call if this happens. but i'm just curious as to what it is and why i may be feeling this.also where the episiotamy stiitches are is it supposed to be puffy or flat?
2644,i'm 20 years old and have been experiencing constant nausea for about 14 months...my doctor sent me to a gastroenterologist who did an upper endoscopy and said everything looked fine. then finally, just about a month ago, they discovered that i had a large ovarian cyst (14 x 10cm), which i had surgery for two and half weeks ago; he also had to remove a small part of my ovary. obviously i thought after the cyst was gone, the nausea would go away, but it hasn't!i am wondering if i could have some type of hormone imbalance? it seems like that could be linked to having the cyst, and i know my mom had imbalance problems when she was my age- and she also had a cyst just like mine. i've always had heavy periods, but i didn't think it was a big deal as long as i had them regularly. lately i've been feeling lightheaded and kind of like i'm not fully awake, even though i'm getting plenty of sleep. i expected to get my period a few days ago, but because of the surgery i might skip a month anyway.i'm going to my surgery follow-up appt on thursday and i'm looking forward to seeing what the gynecologist has to say. would i likely have to go to an endocrinologist if i wanted to get my hormones tested? i guess an endocrinologist would be the next person i would want to see anyway if the gyno can't find the problem. i was just wondering if anyone knew anything about this! if anyone has experience with this i'd appreciate the input! thanks :)
2645,i was wondering if anyone had taken carafate suspenssca for a stomach ulcer.    my doctor prescribed this medication for me yesterday, so i have just started taking it.    how long does it take to be effective?    i understand it is an 8-week treatment.    i certainly hope it starts to help soon as i have been miserable for the past few days.

2647,i had a mastectomy with reconstruction 4 1/2 yrs ago. i had the tram flap procedure everything went fine and the flap seems to be a success.    two months ago i started feeling this heavy and hard feeling starting under my reconstruct breast and all across my tummy.    i had a ct scan and everything looks fine,    went back to the plastic surgeon and he says he doesn't think is related to the flap procedure.     and yet i feels this way, if i move feels worse.    can't do crunches or exercise too much.    don't know what to do??    confuse in tally, thanksthis discussion is related toproblems after tram flap surgery and hernia repair.

2650,my daughter is three years old and is completely potty trained when it comes to urinating.    but, for some reason she only wants to poop in a diaper.    she will hold it and say the poop is coming and cries for a diaper.    if i refuse to put a diaper on her and insist that she sit on the potty, she screams and cries until she poops.    after she poops she is ok, not great, but is ok.    she has on occasion clapped her hands, flushed the toilet and been very proud about her accomplishment and tells me that she will poop in the potty next time.    that it was fun. other times, it's just ok and insist that i flush the toilet immediatley.    but, by the time she has to go again, it's the same thing all over.    screaming, crying hysterically, asking for a diaper, until she poops and she is happy she did it. any ideas about this behavior and if i'm doing the right thing by refusing her the diaper to poop in?

2652,05:57 pm edt monday, april 5, 2010--------------------rnc chief of staff ken mckay has resigned, a week after    improper spending by committee staff came to light.
2653,i never had any problems with my stomach, until a couple weeks before my txended. then i got this bug.it looks like this: it starts with lackof appetite (unusual foe me!) and then chills, and diarhoea..and after that, i feel drained, with more chills, and an achey(achy)neck.it hasn't been too bad so far, only two bouts right before my tx was over, and a couple bouts since it ended 2 weeks ago. i really dont want to do the whole stool sample thing yet, so i am treating it with probiotics, and other natural remedies.i noticed nobody ever mentioned using pepto bismo for stomach upset, during tx, but i think i may try it now, as it has worked well for me in the past.has anybody else experienced this type of bug post tx,and if so, how did youtreat it?    my eosinophils were at zero last week, on my eot labs, so i am freaked out thatit may be intestinal parasites :o ~~~~~~~~~~
2654,i bit my tongue two days ago...now it is hurting in the place of the bite as there is a huge white canker sore at the same place i bit it...also on the same side, there seems to be 3 or 4 bumps on my tongue about 1 cm away fromthe bite. there is no puss coming out though. is my tongue infected?also, i bit my tongue while having lunch, then at night after about 10 hours i felt a pain in my neck under the jaw on the same side of the bite...the next day i woke up and the pain in my neck/throat was worse and i couldnt swallow easily. now it is easing a bit. is this related to the biting incident?
2655,i had a spot come up on my lower back a few years ago, that recurred infrequently-maybe 3 times.    always in the same spot, small blisters.    it hasn't occurred in at least 8 years.    i recently tested positive for hsv-2 and my ob suspects the spot on my back is actually herpes.    i've never had any cold sores, fever blisters, etc. on my mouth or genitally.    i'm in the process of beginning a new sexual relationship and this, naturally, has caused some concern.    can you give me any advice?    thanks so much.
2656,did anybody get a bed cough as a side effect of the combo treatment?if yes, how did you treat it?
2657,my partner and i had sex three times during the week that i ovulated (mind you i wasn't aware that i did). we used condoms each time. two of the three times that we did it he ejaculated outside, and we considered it safe. but the third time that he pulled out, the condom broke (while it was coming out) and the ejaculate pretty much went all over him (but not me). my period is about two days late now- i wonder if i could be pregnant because of that?
2658,has anyone else experienced these symptoms?    around week six i started clearing my throat (especially at the end of the day).    what did you do?    thanks.    mike.
2659,i am 56 years old, recently had a cough for 2 months and was told it was a touch oh phenomia after a chest xray and was put on to antibiotics.2nd chest xray was not improved and showed fluffy bits and lumps and bumps which they thought could be tb.next i went for a cat scanthen they took samples from my lungs to grow them.results are inconclusive, they say they dont know whats wrong with me and i am being refered to mediastinoscopy and they say thay are not looking for cancer at this timehas anyone any idea what i might have ?
2660,have ever, or regularly, masturbate in order to prime yourself before intercourse??this might seem like a silly question, but to me, and i would assume to most men, the idea seems a bit odd, if only because the end result would be a negative one for most guys who might try this tactic. i don't mean masturbating until you get off. that would make a little sense for a guy who might want to last longer, to masturbate shortly beforehand, since the second one always takes longer than the first.i'm talking about just masturbating enough to get yourself ready, i suppose?? i mean, if i did that, it would be horrible for my wife because i would be ready to explode in no time after getting started (which can already be an issue as it is).but i do know you ladies are different in terms of sex and reaching orgasm, so i could see where it makes sense. so again, do you normally do this? or do you at times, depending on the situation? or is thie idea of this just as proposterous to most women as it seems to a man?? let me know...

2664,here goes...hopefully this forum provides me some support or at least one person that may be going through the same thing i am.i'm 34 years old and i feel like i have the body of an 80 year old. in 2007 i broke my left ankle and had to wear a walking boot for approx. 8 months. during that 8 months i started experiencing tremendous pain in my right hip. originally it was diagnosed as trochanteric bursitis. i had a steroid injection and that didn't help the pain. i then had an mri and it was determined that i had the beginnings of avn in that hip which was more than likely caused by about 10 years of oral steroids for asthma when i was younger. anywho...the pain continued and i endured multiple steroid injections, anti-inflam patches, creams, anti-inflam pills, tens unit...you name it, i've tried it.last january i lost my job and i make too much on unemployment to qualify for healthcare assistance (it's a great group to be in let me tell ya! lol) so i was unable to go to any docs for my hip and i decided i would just suffer with the pain until i could no longer stand it. during this time i also moved to another city....sooooo last month i could barely walk. the pain is in the right groin, the front of the hip, the buttock and when i lay down my entire leg aches. i decided to go to a new doc up here. i explained everything i had been through as far as treatment on the hip. do you know what his suggestion was?? a freakin injection! lol. this one was to be done under x-ray though. his theory was that none of the other docs knew for sure if they hit the right spot because they weren't viewing it under x-ray. soooo i had the painful injection two weeks ago and guess what. it didn't help a thing. i called the doc and i'm going back on wednesday...i've had so many injections in the hip that i have a major crater there from fat atrophy.i know that was a long story...but has anyone experienced anything like this? it's more than bursitis.....could the avn be progressed to a point that bad enough to hurt that bad yet not be seen on x-ray? he mentioned that it may look like i have a labral tear on my x-ray...what is that and is it something to be treated because he mentioned it like it was nothing. i'm so frustrated.thanks for listening!
2665,i just wanted to know if anyone has tested positive for hcv, asymptomatic, and choosing not to treat at this time.. and, if so, why?
2666,i can`t figure out how to type a question mark.the key has the normal question mark on top and the forward slash on the bottom, but it also has a big   on the top right, and a small forward slash type thing on the bottom right.i get   instead of forward slash and   instead of a question mark.hells bells....these fangle dangle machines.any suggestions mike
2667,i'm hoping someone may have insight into thisi woke up 5 days ago with slight irritation on one side of my labia... like where my thong touches. i had noticed an increase in milky discharge (with no unpleasant odor) so assumed possibly i had a yeast infection coming on.of course i looked every 3 seconds at it and it got a little more and more uncomfortable.night two worried me the most.. i think the monistat applied topically did it. it was still only slightly red but burning (topically only). i noticed that it would feel that way when it was in contact with my discharge.. when i was sitting down and my underwear is against it (presumably soaking up the moisture) there is very little discomfort.i also have noticed the discomfort moves around depending on how i am sitting or what i am doing. sometimes its back on my anus (on the left side) and other times it is all the way up front on the left side above the clitoris area... again where the discharge touchesyesterday it was almost better until i took a super hot shower and used a lot of water on that area.. then my anus was stinging.. so i got the smart idea to use some lubriderm on it.. yeah hold moisture on a too moist area.. smart, eh?anyhow, there are no bumps, no sores, no cuts, just a little bit of redness (which is on both sides actually) and then topical soreness which feels like its a bit raw. it has been going on for about 5 days and is no worse (at times better)my boyfriend has never had any symptoms of anything like this before, nor have i. we havent even had scares beforeany ideas???????
2668,hi,i know everyone gets different symptoms, but is it correct that most people that get blisters from herpes are sensitive on them?    do they hurt?

2670,about 20 years ago i had multiple (5) surgeries for anal rectal fistulas.    after each surgery another one would form.    this is very rare from what i understood.    i ended up having a diverting colostomy in place for 9 months to give the area time to heal.    you can only imagine the pain and hell i went through, this took place over a 2 1/2 year span.well, now i am really freaking out.    i'm having some of the same pain and symptoms as before, plus, i also have a pilonidal cyst that has occurred.    this has gotten a little better over the week.    i've had them before and it's healed on it's own.my question is, would you open this can of worms again?    i am so scared!!    what would you do if you were me?    wait it out, or go to a surgeon?this discussion is related tofistula surgery..
2671,in the past 2 months i've had cataract surgery in both eyes.    i saw so beautifully after 3 days...everything so sharp, so clear.    aprox. 6 weeks i had the 2nd surgery.    again, great.    within the next few weeks my left (first surgery) eye vision started decreasing, with floaters and flashes...worse than before the surgery.    went to the dr.    and asked for all the dr.s in the practice to observe.    less than a week later my right eye started the same thing.    my vision is bad, i won't drive at night...i'm losing balance and falling, and have eye aches.    they've made an appointment for a retina specialist and have under diagnosis...post-op cataract c/o floaters and metamorphopsia...i looked this up and am really in a panic.    i need some feed back.    i told them i had a tid aprox. 2 years ago and am a bleeder.    they said, not to worry.    the eye rarely bleads.?????please reply,thank you,claudia
2672,everyone is saying what to use to relieve constipation from methedone...but no one has said here that methedone paralyzes the nerve endings in your bowels, therefore making it extremly difficult to go.i've tried smoothe move tea,flaxseed,prunes,fiber,you name it, i've tried it and all it does is soften the stool...and there it is,yucky soft stool that doesn't want to come out,it's just there,who wants a dirty bum???somebody's just gotta read this and give me some advice....
2673,i had an anterior cervical fusion two level c5-c7 on march 19th 2008.    i still cannot speak.    i understood i might have problems the first few weeks but this seems to be going on a long time and getting worse.    now i am having difficulty breathing.    i am scheduled to have pulmonary function testing tomorrow.    i am really scared.    it's not bad enough living in constant pain (have lumbar issues also) neurologist will not even look at lower back issues until cervical fusion surgery is further along in the healing process.    not only am i scared but i feel so alone.    my husband is very supportive but i had no idea how not talking affects your life.    i can't even pick up a phone to call my father or children.    sounds like i am having a pity party.    i don't want to sound that way and apologize if thats how it sounds.    if anyone has suffered similar problems please let me know.    i just thought about joining a support group online yesterday.    wish i had done so a long time ago.    i know there are so many of us suffering with constant pain.

2675,so i've been having these 'dizzy' spells for quite a long time - but i'm not sure if it qualifies as dizzyness without any neurological symptoms or loss of coordination/balance? i went to an ear doctor who went through it with me, and he said i had no symptoms - and he's right, because i didn't have the symptoms when he checked... it's only sometimes.today, i was driving my car, and i had to reverse a lot.. this made me feel a bit dizzy and sick, so i waited for a while before continuing to drive.. as long as it went forwards, there wasn't really a problem. now, it's afternoon, and it's almost 10 hours ago i drove. at lunch i felt slightly better, but it's back now.. dizzyness from driving alone would not last that long?thanks!

2677,i'm quite confused to whats going on.i'm always tired i go to bed early and wake up at a decent time. during the week i get my 8-12 hours of sleep, also workout and eat healthy. i live a good lifestyle and i feel at 21 i shouldn't be feeling like this especially because i don't have anything that stresses me minus the fact that i'm always tired. also nothing has changed same school and job.went to 3 different regular doctors they don't know what it is had my blood drawn and everything was perfect, went to gnc and got expensive vitamin b pills, still didn't fix the problem. due to my tiredness it makes me depressed, i cannot concentrate, i always feel very overwhelmed and get anxiety.knowing that i have something to do during the week i start panicking and get very overwhelmed and fidgety. i took a few semesters off from school because i have been getting bad grades due to feeling careless and unable to focus.i've always been one who has it hard to focus in school and finishing my school task completely,i always am doing 3 things at once. this has been going on for about three in a half years now and it's just getting worst. the worst part is it's effecting my school because i just can't sit there and concentrate and stay focused.its also depressing that my friends are all energetic and excited to do things and i cant because i'm constantly thinking about sleeping.iv'e been researching there's quite a few things that stood out to me that could possibly be the problem.first i thought i was anemic but blood tests,iron were perfect.i also was looking and saw that i had a lot of symptoms of adult add.so i took a test and it came out to 72 which scores that i most likely am and should seek professional help.one of my good friends has add and is prescribed to adderall(adderrall),i talked to him about it and he said i could possibly have it. so he gave me one of his adderalls to test and it completely helped me got everything done,felt energized, and i honestly haven't felt like that for a very long time.felt like a new person,stay focused and did things throughout the day.so i decided to go to a psychiatrist yesterday,very nice and really understood me,unlike other doctors he made me feel comfortable. he then prescribed me viibryd it's a new prescription and it will help you focus and be not so depressed about the sleeping, ext..my other doctor prescribed me lorazepum(does nothing for me) because he thinks i have anxiety, which i somewhat do.strongly researching,i don't think i should take the viibryd (if anyone knows any info on it or experienced viibryd i'm interested on hearing your experience or what you think about it) i don't think i'm that depressed as much as others for this also reviews on the viibryd are bad.with the lorazepum just makes me more tired and relaxed and still not getting my responsibilities done, and my psychiatrist agreed about the lorazepum that i shouldn't take it. now i'm unsure how i go about getting adderall(adderrall)from my psychiatrist or what to say,i heard its hard to be prescribed it. i almost feel awkward to even suggest it to him because he probably thinks i'm just another college student trying to get adderall(adderrall)and get high or whatever it is that college kids do with it.i honestly am not like that i felt like a normal person when i took it,got so much done and felt like it was for me. my psychiatrist did say i could have add but didn't go much forward about it.just gave me the anti depressant pills which seem like a big harm to the body.i don't know if i should tell him about the aderall i tried or tell him i got sick off this viibryd or ask to take actions on finding out if i do have add? i just don't want to risk not getting it.also thinking of just going to another psychiatrist and say my doctor said i should take viibyrd for my slight depression and my possible add problem? so what to do?!i'm only 21 and i miss out on everything because i get overwhelmed, over think,and have a temper! hope someone can help! thank you.
2678,i was required to submit for a random drug screening for my job, and the results showed that i had recently ingested a large amount of cocaine. i have never had a history of any sort of drug abuse, which is why i still have my job, but there is a negative mark on my work history.this is my question; a day or so before my test, i applied a lidocain patch to my back that i recieved from my grandmother for a reccuring backache. could this patch have affected my drug test as a positive read for cocaine?
2679,hello everyone,in sept. i had a laparotomy done for stage 4 endo and cysts. after that my obgyn sent me to a fertility doc b/c she said the ends of my tubes looked clubbed (the finger-like things were shorter). so fertility doc said ivf would be my best option b/c i am high risk for ectopic pregnancy. well, i went for workup blood and we found out i was pregnant. it was however an ectopic pregnancy. but here's where it gets strange, my husband went in for a semen anaylisis and it came back no sperm! now he had smoked marijuana a week before this test, so the dr. scheduled another one for a month later, which was today, he has not smoked marijuana in about 2 months but his anaylisis came back no sperm again!!! how can he have no sperm and i got pregnant??? i am faithful to my husband, i have never strayed. they told me that the marijuana could have been a cause and sometimes could take 3 months or so to leave system, however at the time i had gotten pregnant he was using marijuana almost everyother day. ( i have since fought with him to quit which he has) andwhen i told the dr. that she didnt really have an answer. has anyone ever heard of a semen anaylisis comming back twice no sperm but the female had been pregnant a month before???
2680,i am a 33 year old malein january 2010, i had unprotected sex with a girl, if i recall it felt like a little irritation for 2 weeks..but not enough to really raise my attention..( i realize now that gon and clym take 2 weeks for symtoms(symptoms)i have read) then after 2 weeks..i had sex with a condom..but unprotected oral with an ex.    2 days later i had awful burning and urge to urinate, completely unbearable and had to go to the hospital. doctor took a swab and gave me a shot..prescription for 4 azithromycin and sent me on my way. the next day i had relieve but still slight burning.the next week i seen my family doctor and told him what happened, i told him i didnt have relief yet..and he prescribed me doxycycline for 2 weeks. i contacted both girls and neither claimed to have postive test results. my test result came back positive for clymedia ( if false possitives arent that common? i am unsure at this point)i did not have sex with the first girl again, however i did have sex with the ex...protected and unprotected oral. same problem..not not as strong. ( at this point i blamed lubricated condoms? or i gave her something orally) i continued on doxyclcline and also went on flagyl, more azithro. tons of drugs on the course of the year and always would get this problem after having sex with her orally and even non orally eventually. i believe she insisted it was an excuse to leave her...alone. eventually i blamed her and left her alone by fall. there were 2 incidents with her..that i had very slight symtoms(symptoms). i also noticed that the more i had sex with her...the worse it got.still no relief but i see a patern that after having sex with her..and sometimes stronger symtoms(symptoms)than others...my sinus's would flare..my mouth would be frothy in the morning and it would burn when i urinated and very frequent urination that lasts and fades for up to 2 weeks. with or without antibiotics i had learned eventually, i thought doxycycline was giving me relief but maybe the frequent urinating is just an illusion to relief...i am unsure of everything at this point. another consistant symtom is thick ejactulation and low sex drive untill eventually after 2 weeks my ejaculation starts becoming watery again..and my sex drive goes back up.note that i have had several tests for urine tests, clym, gona, swabs...all negative...except for the first one..also took them in the early morning to prevent bad results...apox 5 tests..at various times during the year.so i eventually had sex with a different woman, a friend..someone i can trust, it was drunk and i had not had symtoms(symptoms)for 3 weeks and had taken medications and stopped. i assuming the ex was the cause. i had no problems the first time...however...the second time with this woman i had problems again...possible coincidence? or did i pass her something?    she went to the doctor and got all tests she could....with her family doctor who she is close with....her doctor advised her she was fine and had nothing. i trust this opinion unlike the other 2 before.i never had sex with this woman again...fear of problems..i later had sex beginning of this year with a younger girl of 19, no problems, no oral sex.. condom used... didnt notice problems....had sex second time with no condom..no oral sex....never really noticed any problems maybe a slight irritation, unsure if it was normal, i have forgotten what normal is now.note that most of these girls have had sex with one or more guys after..and i have not heard anything about problems or have i been asked or consulted about anything.i finally got an apointment to a urolgist, he imediatly told me that he sees this problem all the time, that its just pretty much in my mind , appologized that he wasnt being rude and that if it eased my mind i could get a tube down my uretha with a camera and view for any problems...this i have not done yet, nor do i think it will solve anything. he also said it cannot be my anatomy if i masturbate and have no problems..yet have sex with the original girl that is my ex and immediatly have problems. his suggestion was to stay away from her and move on.    i found this useless information i drove 4 hours for. :(i met a new girl in the last month, has sex with her once with a condom, no problems it seemed...no oral sex....second time a few days ago......this is the longest i havent had problems...over 1 month almost 2......but this should be noted,,, i had drank alot of alcohol in the last 2 weekends..and drank alot of pepsi...i noticed a very slight burning coming back...but it did not make me urinate or anything of that sort. i had sex with this girl without a condom...and the results were as strong as the original ex...i am now right back to where i started. 24 hour burning....im sure i have more to this story, but cannot think of it..but can answer any questions that may target the problem. i also used to urinate in a clear glass and watch the results every day. i noticed that my urine would have a white stringy substance and somewhat cloudy in its centre almost like a cloudy centralized unit with stringy white stuff coming from it..maybe 4 of them. as my symtoms(symptoms)depleted so would this substance ( i had sent in urine with this showing for testing, unsure of what they tested for, i think a basic test, unsure if this would show anything)i am beyond frustrated at this point....and lost.. do i have clymidia?    is it in my prostate?are the symtoms(symptoms)im getting can be something else? can i relieve symtoms(symptoms)of clymedia on my own? but never fully get rid of it?was i miss diagnosed in the beginning? or did i catch 2 different things? one still remaining?has all this caused me to develop some type of problem in which i cannot fight off different bacteria of other peoples throats or womens vaginal fluids?id like to know how i can actually test what this is?thank you for your time and expertise, i am willing to follow up and continue this thread untill a problem is found as i do not believe im alone in this suffering. and im certianly not making it up... the symtoms(symptoms)are extremely strong. and not stress related at all as you can clearly see.thank you for you help
2681,my son has a few problems but at the moment when he washes his hair or scratches the back of his head at the base he gets blurred vision evry time can you tell me what this could possibly be
2682,hello! i've been diagnosed with eds for a few years now...i was wondering does anyone know if its possible for people with our condition to get facial fillers? (restylane, juvederm, collagen, botox, or retin- a creams?) the reason i ask is because i've noticed that the skin on my face is getting thin and wrinkled, especially around my stretchy eyes. ( due to eds) i know it sounds vain, but i'm just been tired of feeling like an old lady my whole life...i don't want to look like one too. :( i'm only in my twenties and avoid sun exposure and use spf daily. is there any treatment that works to preserve our skin or are we out of luck?thanks to all that respond.
2683,hi!i come here today because i know i need a support group if i am ever going to be able to kick this habit.    i am a single mother to a 3 year old boy.    my life is nothing but stress, and his father gives me no type of child support, neither physical, emotional, or physical.    i have a wonderful mother, and wonderful siblings.    i was not a great teenager, always getting into trouble.    i got pregnant with my son at 22.    i was married to his father, and it turned out he was using me for his green card.    when i had my son, the performed a c-section.    i was given percocet for this procedure.     long story short, when i took these percs, the pain was gone and i didn't dwell on my son's father day and night.    after my prescription ran out (it lasted about 2 days), and the dr wouldn't refill, i stopped taking them.    then 7 weeks later, when i got a job, someone was selling them at the job. i was really going through it with my husband and i started buying them everyday to deal with my emotional problems that i was having.    they made me feel great, and not so emotional about the fact that this man was treating me so bad.    ever since then, i'm addicted.    now i finally go rid of the loser, and i have another loser to deal with.    this addiction.    i decided last night that i was going to quit today.    unfortunately, the withdrawal was unbearable.    i have to work and take care of my son.    i can not tell my mom about this, as she is not understanding about addictions. she told me when i had my son that he was my son.    i carry that with me, and know she has 2 jobs and is not able to stop her life to take my son while i go to a rehab or even just while i detox.    i had so many things i had to do today,    i just couldn't do them with those symptoms so i bought 10 end 10.    i want to stop!    please, someone describe how i can taper off of them, starting the first day (tomorrow) with 5 perc 10.    please i want my life back!    i can't afford a week off of work or a week away from my son.    i will be forever grateful if someone can give me a way to do this that doesn't interrupt my entire life.    thank you!

2686,abnormal sweating still annoying (prostatitis)hello ,i am 28 year old,male.5months ago i have been diagnosed with prostatitis (chronical prostate infections). i used initially 30days levofloxacin,which improved my pain and symptoms more than 60%. 2 weeks after having completed first 30days antibotics, i started to have mild symtomps again (testicle pain,abnormal sweating,groin pain). i went to another urolog this time in germany and he wrote me another 4 weeks levofloxacin. now i am also done with last antibiotics since 20days.my pains are 90% gone, no back pain,no testicle pain anymore. however my biggest problem 'abnormal sweating' starting from groin area down to legs and up to lower back still exist and this bothers me much. 3 or 4 urologs i have been to, told me that i should wait maybe 1 year more since this bacterial inflammation in my prostate could last for long time,years >remark=(my tiroid and all other blood results are ok,chest xrays and ultrasound results are all clean). i am sure and i feel it is still my prostate gland which causes my abnormal sweating. my last doctor wrote me tilcotil (anti  nflam.). i still sit in hoth bath tubes hoping last remaining bacterias will be defeated by time and this sweating will disappear.it is not just sweating, problem is also not being able to perform sport and attend to social activities due to sweating.i hope to hear something from you, maybe some home remedies which could helpthanks alex

2689,36 female. 14 weeks postpardum w/ hx of lupus, no current meds. i began having problems with blurry va left eye, mri/mrv normal. bloodwork normal, eye exam normal. i also have pulsating vision at times, unsure why. had weakness on left side numbing in my jaw and tingling in my legs and hand. 2 neuro checks out fine, but 4 days ago, sudden onset of fleeting quick muscle spasms all over, my legs, my arms, i feel them sporadic all over. i also feel very weak and feel that my hands do not have good strength and am shaky.    i am very anxious and afraid of all of the info i have read about als.    i am having a hard time functioning for fear of having this disease and leaving my 2 children.    i just cannot understand why i am having these all over shakes, i am going crazy.    with als, is it common that it starts like this? thank you.
2690,i have had two nuclear stress tests in 5 years because of a stressful life and need for reassurance at age 76 that my heart is in good shape...don't exercise much, but am healthy, not overweight and in good shape. my question is, does carotid artery damage show up on these tests? and if not, what is the next step to check that area....i just need peace of mind...i have an invalided husband, and daughter and little grandaughter living with me, and the stress is huge...although i am of a peaceful nature.
2691,i have my first appointment with an ms neuro at the end of this month.    my pcp says that this is what my symptoms most likely fit and my newer symptoms make fibromyalgia less likely.    so he is pushing to get me in and find out for sure because if i don't hurry up he says i will miss the boat on this disease.any thoughts? what should i expect? i am kind of at a lost on what to hope for.    do i hope positive so limbo is over? or do i hope it isn't because i don't really want it?tahiri
2692,my husband has suffered from tolosa hunt for 2 years he has seen several doctors and treated with several meds, including predisone for 2 years, methotrexate,radiation treatments 2 different times,and a brain biopsy. we have had no success in treating this, its only getting worse. does anyone have other suggestions?
2693,i'm on the pill, and normally i start taking sugar pills on a wednesday and get my period that friday until sunday. i had sex on the 17th of june and we used a condom and he pulled out. on sunday july 1st, i experienced some bleeding which was like a light period. that bleeding continued on monday, tuesday, and wednesday. on that wednesday i took my sugar pills and the bleeding stopped until that saturday and sunday. it was light enough to fill up a panty liner each day. it lasted for 5 days total, and it still looked like a light period. would you think this is implantation bleeding or a messed up period because of stress, or an increase in working out?
2694,visit this week to oncologist.    ca27-29 still going down, (test three weeks from last one), but decision was to discontinue gemzar and carboplatin, (bad reaction to the carboplatin six weeks ago after being on it for 9 months,alternating with taxotere).    because of the l-glutamine supplement working after last taxotere to control/eliminate mouth sores, doctor asked if i would go back to taxotere every three weeks instead of every six weeks with another chemo in between.    so, now i will start next week on an every three-week cycle of taxotere with the addition of avastin. i understand that avastin has recently been approved for breast cancer.    it seems as if it can have some horrible side-effects in 2% of the people, (congestive heart failure, stroke, lung hemhorrage), and as i seem to get every side-effect from every chemo i have been on, this is a little scary!.    any information on avastin from those who may have taken it?    (i was diagnosed with stage iv estrogen receptor positive bc with metastises to the bones in 2004, controlled by arimidex for 27 months, but then spread to lungs and liver in jan2007, so had to start chemo at that point.    ca27-29 was 9500 before starting taxotere and carboplatin, now down to 135 and i have returned to work full-time)
2695,i just had my second m/c and my doctor want me to have a hsg at the hospital.    has anyone has this done?    my problem isn't becoming pregnant, its staying pregnant.    my two m/c were very early 6 weeks and 8 weeks.    help! i'm scared
2696,my husband suffered a hemorragic stroke 3 weeks ago. he has reagained some use of his right side again but still can't talk much or walk. what is his chance of survival?
2697,someone brought up a good point, and one that i've been wondering about since my diagnosis.    are fibrosis and cirrhosis one in the same?    some medical people imply that it is, and some imply it isn't just by the mere virtue of calling it two different things.    and, if the two are not the same, then what exactly is the difference?    i have a nice color picture (astra pharm) of the whole gi system, (got it from hep doc's office) which shows what each of the healthy organs look like and what they look like as they progress towards disease.    the liver looks like this in order of severity:normal liver->bacterial hepatitis->viral hepatitis->fatty liver->cirrhosis->post necrotic cirrhosis.    nowhere in this diagram is there an arrow pointing to, or even a mention of, fibrosis.    unless it's cirrhosis!    am i on the right track?    can you unconfuse me, if that's possible?    :)        kathy (activist)
2698,hi,i just joined this group and i'm trying to find some answers.    i have had severe pain in my back and legs for years, would stumble now and then and had times of my legs hurting so bad that all i could do was try to sleep.    it was all intermittent.    it became worse in 01/08 and by 03/08 i could barely walk, the pain became constant, and a new thing hit, my lower half from the hips to the toes gets actually physically colder than it should.    by 4/08 i couldn't walk at all, i can't move my legs, i can't put any weight on them without falling.    i went to the er since i am uninsured and from there was referred to a neurologist.    i had multiple ct's with and without contrast, multiple mri's with and without contrast, x-rays of my back and legs, blood work, and a nerve conduction test.    the lowest temperature in my lower half    has hit 36 degrees as confirmed during the nerve conduction test when they had to use a heat lamp and hot towels to get it to register.    my lower half gets too cold, after laying flat for several hours with a heating blanket then my temperature will increase to normal, my skin will feel clammy once it warms up.    i am always too tired, always in too much pain that goes from my neck to my toes, and i have lost all muscle strength in my legs and am losing strength in my hands and arms.    the neurologist said i have degenerative spinal bone disease because the tests show bone spurs all over my spine, i have two discs in my neck that are bulging, one disc in my lower lumbar that is compressed but none of those are pinching the nerves, i have damaged the autonomic nerve in my leg because the test shows that the area where the nerve should be is black and doesn't receive or send signal, i have a tumor on my kidney, a tumor on my right ovary, and a lesion on my liver.    the official diagnosis was degenerative spinal bone disease and degenerative autonomic nerve damage causing complex regional pain syndrome.    i don't know what to think or what to do.    i am so tired of being in constant pain and not being able to walk or move my legs and now with my hands and arms being affected i am afraid of what may happen next.    the pain increases and my lower half starts decreasing in temperature the longer i sit up.    the neurologist said that she ruled out ms because i don't meet all of the criteria and she didn't see any lesions on my spine, just bone spurs and discs out.any ideas would be appreciated.
2699,quite a few weeks ago my lower eyelid was puffy and sore, feeling a bit like it was bruised.    now it feels fine, except a bit of itching now and then and my eyelashes near the area are turned toward my eye probably because of the slight bulge where the infection is.    there is a ball type feel to it on the outside and the inside of the eyelid has a light shape to it, like a healing sore.    recently i had an eye doctor visit and was told it was a staph infection.    i was instructed to apply a hot compress and massage it, putting a drop of vigamox two times a day for 7 days.    it has not seemed to change other than less dryness at night and throughout the day.    any suggestions?
2700,i am in week 11 incevik and and und at week 4, at week 8 still und but everything was low wbc 1.7 rbc 2.82 hbg 9.6 they where talking adjusting meds, i told them no just check it again i have been feeling a bit better and think i have come up. she said she did not think so, but having treated me with inter/peg for 84 weeks before and knowing me she would check. well yesterday she called and said to continue on as i have been that my levels had risen up a little wbc 1.9 rbc 2.95 hbg 10.0 no great jump but going up.i think this is a very good sign ? what you think ?
2701,my boyfriend and i had sex and he hit something that kind of hurt, moved a little bit and was fine. i never experienced any discomfort but then a day later i went to the bathroom and on the tp was light pink spotting. i chalked it up to being my period so i got a pad. the next morning, there was nothing but i figured i would start later in the day so i continued with the pad. when i went to work i had gone to the bathroom and checked the pad to find a very light caramel colored    goey spot on the pad. i was very confused because i have never seen anything like that. i wiped it off and have not seen it since. later that evening had notice that i had begun to have more discharge- a reddish/brown color. not really bleeding and no sort of lining discharge. typically i get bloated, have lower back pain and my breasts get very tender before my period- this time nothing. i am due for my period so i would have assumed this is it but it's so different from any others. my boyfriend and i are not using any type of contraceptive, we have been intimate for the last 6 months w/ no changes in my period. i don't know if it's because he could have hit my cervix a certain way, if i could be pregnant or if i should worry about have some other problem. there has been no change in diet or stress until now.
2702,i read somewhere that you can have hearing loss from ms. i have a ringing most of the time....but this has happened to me:recently, my left ear went very muffled, full feeling...then went to hearing nothing out of the left ear at all for a few minutes...then back to the full, muffled feeling.then the next day, the left ear continued to feel full, and hearing is muffled....but then everytime i talked, or someone else talks, i was hearing a very amplified high pitch echo in my left ear. like a roaring, whistling, echo....this has happened several different times lasting a day or less each time.no cold or sickness at all. i had my hearing tested, is was within normal limits, i also saw and ent, who didn't see anything wrong with my ears.currently, i am back to my okay hearing, with just the constant humming and ringing.does this sound ms related to you?thanks
2703,about 2 months ago i had a really bad rash on my inner thighs that made it hard to even walk around. i went to my dermatologist and he prescribed ketaconazole cream and another cortizone cream telling me it was a fungus. at first this was only on my thighs and not on my scrotum or penis. those creams didn't really do much the first week but they did seem to irritate my scrotum. two weeks later my thighs looked about the same and now my scrotum was very swollen, very itchy, and red. i went to a different dermatologist and he gave me protopic cream and a prescrip for antibiotics (he also said to continue using the ketaconazole as well). the first night i applied the protopic to my scrotum the only thing i can say is it was the worst discomfort i have ever felt in my life... my scrotum was on fire! ice was the only thing that would help it. i lost a few nights sleep because of it. i didn't continue using the protopic but did continue using the ketaconazole for about 2 weeks and everything finally got really dry and my skin on my thighs and on my scrotum (and a little on my penis as well) started to flake off. then everything got back to normal and that's the way it stayed for about two months. now about 2 weeks ago i ate a few mangos (never had them before) and had a reaction on my face. i had a rash around my eyes and my upper lip got blisters on it. i went to the derm. and he prescribed a dose of prednisone. i took it for about 4 days and i was back to normal with my eyes still being a little itchy but the rash seems to be gone. now two days after i stopped taking the prednisone my scrotum all of a sudden is all red, swollen, and itchy! the underside of my penis is inflamed as well. nothing on my thighs at all. i lost another night of sleep last night because of the intense itchyness and now i don't know what to do. is this a reaction to the prednisone? or the mangos? the dr. gave me a 30ct supply of the prednisone but he told me to only take it for a few days... should i finish the prescription? thanks for any help.
2704,i am a 24 year old woman, and am facing problems with some kind of vaginal infection. this has been going on for over 1 year and 3 months i am literally on the edge.i have seen numerous doctors who have each prescribed me with numerous antibiotics such as flagyl etc.. including meds for me and my partner to take. at first the doctors did tests and actually found a yeast infection however as time past i was dealing with the same complaints and no sign of any type of infection on the test results.on average i would have white see through discharge mixed in with some kind of bloody discharge or just brown discharge, it varies.most times while having intercourse i have difficulties getting moist, and feels like something is scrubbing me from the inside ( extremely painful) and a burning sensation afterwards at times my vagina even swells up about twice its size!i have heard that after long periods of infection people can get a type of vaginism so i'm trying out a sexologist and this has helped me as well but the pain often remains.however my gyno said that its only due to irritation but i am more worried.i feel i should mention , i had an abortion about 2 years ago (no judgment please) and am very scared that maybe something else had gone wrong during this process because i was wide awake and i actually was in extreme pain during the whole ordeal.i also had a very severe infection which was due to the abortion i took some antibiotics for that but afterwards everything was back to normal.i also often have pains in my lower abdomen.please somebody help!i am in desperate needi feel like doctors don't care and have given up

here  s how to stand outbest bets: the visitors of 'v' returndoes mona lisa  s gaze hold clues to painting?..the retired civil engineer said all his calculations come from close readings of the bible, but that external events like the foundation of the state of israel in 1948 are signs confirming the date.beyond the shadow of a doubt, may 21 will be the date of the rapture and the day of judgment, he said.the doctrine known as the rapture teaches that believers will be taken up to heaven, while everyone else will remain on earth for a period of torment, concluding with the end of time. camping believes that will happen in october.if may 21 passes and i'm still here, that means i wasn't saved. does that mean god's word is inaccurate or untrue? not at all, warden said.great disappointmentthe belief that christ will return to earth and bring an end to history has been a basic element of christian belief since the first century. the book of revelation, which comes last in the new testament, describes this conclusion in vivid language that has inspired christians for centuries.but few churches are willing to set a date for the end of the world, heeding jesus' words in the gospels of mark and matthew that no one can know the day or hour it will happen. predictions like camping's, though, aren't new. one of the most famous in history was by the baptist leader william miller, who predicted the end for oct. 22, 1844, which came to be known as the great disappointment among his followers, some of who subsequently founded the seventh day adventist church.in the u.s., there is still a significant population, mostly protestant, who look at the bible as kind of a puzzle, and the puzzle is god's word and it's predicting when the end times will come, said catherine wessinger, a professor at loyola university in new orleans who studies millennialism, the belief in pending apocalypse.a lot of times these prophecies gain traction when difficulties are happening in society, she said. right now, there's a lot of insecurity, and this is a promise that says it's not all random, it's part of god's plan.advertisement | ad infoadvertisement | ad infoadvertisement | ad info.past predictions that failed to come true don't have any bearing on the current calculation, believers maintain.it would be like telling the wright brothers that every other attempt to fly has failed, so you shouldn't even try, said chris mccann, who works with ebible fellowship, one of the groups spreading the message.for believers like mccann, theirs is actually a message of hope and compassion: god's compassion for people, and the hope that there's still time to be saved.that, ultimately, is what spurs on exley, who said her beliefs have alienated her from most of her friends and family. her hope is that not everyone who hears her message will mock it, and that even people who dismiss her now might still come to believe.if you still want to say we're crazy, go ahead, she said. but it doesn't hurt to look into it.copyright 2011 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

2720,i'm 21 years old and i have a slightly large goiter on my neck. i have had it for maybe 4 years, but never paid much attention to it until i started noticing it got somewhat larger, and there was an occasional sharp/stabbing pain. i went to my doctor, she ran blood tests, and she told me that i had hyperthyroidism, so i went home and searched on the internet all the symptoms, and it seems as though i have the opposite. but when i really analyze it the symptoms are basically split in half. i know with most conditions symptoms vary from person to person, but i just find that strange. is there any possible chance my doctor was wrong and it's actually hypothyroidism? how do i go about asking her about that? i don't want to seem like a know-it-all patient, trying to self-diagnose myself with research off the internet. i'm going back next week to discuss my ultrasound results and get started on treatment.also, i'm a little worried about having thyroid cancer. i know it's rare, but there is a pain in my neck right where the goiter is. it's not a constant pain, there is just an abrupt sharp/stabbing pain which occurs a couple times a day perhaps. i feel as though all this waiting is driving me insane and i don't want to wait until next week.if anyone has any advice or answers i'd appreciate it. thanks.

2723,i have seen several posts on toddlers being picky eaters and i know the typical response from experts is that as long as the toddler is otherwise healthy there is nothing to worry about.but our three year old has never shown an interest in eating anything (except for potato chips or yogurt, which she does not mind) ever.    in fact she does not even eat chocolate or cake.    take a piece of chocolate or cake to her mouth and she will run.    she has to practically be force-fed every day.    even feeding her a cup of milk is torture for both involved.    we long for the day when she will be able to eat on her own and are worried she will never adjust to day care.    currently her mom takes care of her at home.    she is developmentally normal and loves playing, being read to, etc., and is otherwise a happy toddler.    height and weight are within the normal range as well.is this at all normal and will she ever eat like normal children?    any tips on how to make her want to eat?any help appreciated.

2730,please help me with my last post. the question was... can i still get pregnant or ovulate if i have a bit of an over grown cyst on each ovary? about 3.5? i feel nautious and i wanna throw up all day. i have been peeing nonstop. and my period is due on the tenth. so too early to check. but my last ultrasound which was on the 22nd, my doctor said that i wasnt ovulating at the moment and i had an enlarged cyst on both ovaries. so i am confused. could i have ovulated a different day and gotten pregnant or the cysts prevented me of it. could i possibly be pregnant? and if i am is it really bad that i have a cyst on each ovary due to my high dosage of clomid?
2731,all right, folks-- could those of you who have actually experienced lyme disease tell me if my teenage daughter sounds like a likely candidate?    her elisa was negative (but so was every other test they've run on her!) and drs aren't interested in following up with a western blot.    i'm trying to decide whether or not to push.first, i should say that she never had a tick bit that we know of, although she was definately in some tick-y areas first week of may.    also, she spent two weeks in rural china at end of march, so no telling what she might have gotten into there.symptoms:    at end of may, she woke up with a wobbly ankle... it just rolls outward when she walks.    she can stand on toes, but not on heel.    during testing, drs discovered some numb areas on leg and opposite arm.    her leg went completely numb for about a week this summer, then went back to just wobbly after she fell and her back seemed to pop.    (no, she has no back problems,according to numeous mris and ct scans).    she has extreme fatigue and back pain.    no headaches, fever or other viral type symptoms.i've discovered i can pull anything from any description on internet and make it fit her... so i'm asking those of you who've really been there.     does this sound at all like lyme--or another tick disease--to you?thanks!dazedmom

2736,not sure if topic area is correct. anyway, several months ago my wife discovered she had a cyst on one of her ovaries (she was in for a bad bladder infection). the doc said it didn't look like anything to worry about. she now has insurance and plans to get it checked out anyways. she has complained on and off lately about a slight pain or discomfort in her abdomen that comes and goes. her periods seem to be on track except for every time she thinks she's done and we have sex, she bleeds some more for another day then she's done (she says i always find her secret pocket and knock it loose). =p she began her period around the 15th and over the last few days we have had alot of doggie style sex along with her complaining of the same abdominal discomfort. the discomfort went away a couple of days ago, but last night during sex while she was climaxing, i looked down and noticed blood beginning to appear on my penis. it seemed to be quite a bit- more than when i find her secret pocket. she has been off the pill for a couple of months (we're trying to get pregnant). could this be because of the cyst or could it be implantation bleeding? from what i've read it's probably not implantation, but it would be nice to know that it was instead of something detrimental! anyone have a clue? -thanks
2737,i am about at my wits end.    for three years now i have had chronic lower abdominal pain.    i have been to so many dr's and er's....still no answers.    this started in 08 after i had my son, and also had surgeries for cervical cancer and to remove my gull bladder.    no one has been able to tell me anything.    at first they would come on once every few months....now i am having them weekly...and i am also having blood in my urine.    there is no warning signs to my pain...it just hits me out of    no where.    it is in my low abdominal, right above my pelvic line.    it radiates sometimes into my back....and hurts all over in the lower abdominal, but sometimes is isolated to the right side from time to time.    when it hits,. it hits hard and i can't even stand up straight.    i get sick to my stomach and it feels like someone is ripping my insides out.    i have had drs laugh at me, i have had them tell it is was all in my head.    at this point, i am so ready to give up and just accept the fact that i will never have an answer or be better.    the pain meds they give me really do nothing for the pain, only make me want to sleep.    i do get a slight relief if i lay on the bed perfectly still and do not move.    the pain is still there, but lessons a tad, of course until i move again.    the full blown pain can last any where from as short as 3 hours to a full 24.    but then once the massive pain is over i am tender and soar for days to follow.    i am so needing answers....if anyone can relate, please advise!    thanks for your time.
2738,i am 41 years old, malemy mri description date 07-11-2008five lumbarized non-rib-bearing segments are assumed.sagittal alignment is normal.    degenerative disc disease seen at l3-4, l4-5 and l5-s1.    degenerative narrowing, disc dehydration, and posterior circumferential annular bulging seen at each level.note also made of right paracentral posterior disc protrusion ant l3-4 with caudal extension.    extrusion measures about 5mm in width and depth.     it measures almost 1cm in greatest length.    it produces mass effect upon the theacal sac and proximal right l4 root in subarticular/lateral recess.axial scans at l4-5 indicate posterior radial annular tear or fissure.    degenerative annular bulging present.    no disc protrusion or extrusion seen.    anterior border thecal sac is flat in the bibulging annulus.axial scans at l5-s1 indicate broad based shallow left paracentral posterior disc protrusion.    this produces slight mass effect upon and displacement of proximal left s1 root which is not enlarged.multilevel mild facet arthropathy identified.    no significant forminal narrowing seen.    no central canal stenosis identified.    unremarkable conus located at t12-l1    bone marrow signal is normal.*** impression1. degenerative disc disease at l3-4, l4-5, l5-s12. right paracentral posterior disc extrusion with caudal extension at l3-4 impinging upon proximal right l4 root.3. shallow broad based left paracentral posterior disc protrusion at l5-s1 minimally impinging upon proximal s1 root.after receiving two cortizone injections directly in the effected are, my pain is gone.    i am noticing that my right foot is sometimes not responding as quickly as it used to.    occasionally i stumble, and might loose my footing. (very occasionally).my question is?1.long term effect of pinched nerve roots.i know i need to see a specialist.2. which is the better approach? neurologist or ortho.    i have already seen an ortho, hence the cortizone injections.3. if i don't have pain anymore, and the pain comes back.    i cortizone just delaying the possible better results of surgery?any resources would be greatly appreciated.this injury spawns back from an injury in my early 20's
2739,i was recently prescribed xanax along with a daily med for anxiety/ panic disorder. i have been taking the daily med, but i am scared by all the warning labels on the xanax and wont take it when needed. what does xanax do? how does it make you feel? is it anything like atarax? gosh i hate being so afraid of everything! any input would be appreciated.

2743,hello all, i have had quite a few raised white large lumps on my cheek and mouth that are painless, and raised. i used dip tobacco for about two years and recently quit.i also have ear pain that comes and goes jaw pain that comes and goes, and a large swollen gland under my neck that pushes up on my tonsil causing a sore throat/feeling like a hair is caught back there.i have an appt for my gp tomorrow. as i have been to urgent care centers, and they have all said that the lumps don't look cancerous, and every time they just test me for strep, which always comes back negative, as well as my dentist. although he did say that some of them could be caused by my improved brushing habits.what i was wondering, is could a lot of this be caused by my chronic infections that i get, like ear infections and tonsillitis. as i have very narrow ear canals. about the only thing that scares me is that lump under my tonsil that is pushing up on it.
2744,what kinds of things can give a false neg for opiods? i take diruetics and a host of other prscription meds. i have a pituitary adenoma which i take brocritine to shrink. could either of these be causing the problem?
2745,i am going in for brain surgery soon. one of the things that devastates me is the thought of being away from my little ones (1 1/2 and 3 1/2) for so long. with no complications, i will be in the hospital for 3-5 days. i suspect i will not want them to visit me there, as i will look pretty bad. of course, i'll still look gross when i get home, but we will deal with that when that time comes. i got mommy/daughter portraits done to remind them of what i will look like again once i am healed.i have only been away from them for 1 night. i need the creative mommas here to help me come up with ideas to help me and them!so far, i have bought them a small present for every day i am gone. it is something that can help entertain them for that day (paint sets, dress up, toys, etc.)i used my webcam to record our nightly prayers together. i am also using my webcam to record me reading stories with them. i will leave the videos for their caregivers to watch with them if they get upset or sad. if they are getting through fine, then there's no need to remind them i'm not there.any other thoughts or ideas? i know someone who used a paper chain with links to be removed for each day the parent was gone, but i don't know how long i will be gone.i know people leave their kids all the time. i just haven't and this is not the best way to start. there are different people coming and going to watch them, and of course everyone i trust to care for my kids is also stressed out about my surgery. i know they will be fine, and i'm probably just transferring my anxieties to this because it's easier to worry about this than think about all the risks of surgery. but i have to plan, i have to do something!!
2746,approximately 2 years ago i had a biking accident and did sever damage to my elbow.    i snapped the head of the radius completely off and dislocated the humerus.    in the process i also managed to tare the entire lateral ligament complex of the elbow.    my surgeon managed to relocate the humerus and reattach the head of the radius with a plate and some screws.    he also managed to reattach the torn ligaments.    after many months of physical therapy i now have almost all of my range of motion back.    since the pain of the surgery has gone away i started to notice that i have been having ulnar nerve problems.    every time i rest my arm on something, like an arm rest, my pinkie finger and ring finger fall asleep really quickly.    i was wondering if this has happened to anyone else out there. or if someone could point me in the right direction with possible problems or treatment.     thanks in advance.
2747,my almost 7 year old son is afraid of, well, a lot.    he screams when we pick him up certain ways, he is scared of automatic doors, loud noises...things like that..he also seems to have a gag reflex when he sees someone with something on their face, a scab on another child, a crumb on a table, my other son using mouthwash...anything will set him off.    i'm not sure what to do..do i let him work through it, do i take him to a counselor?........help!!
2748,i have a golden retriever named samson.    samson and i have been working on basic commands and appropriate manners when greeting people.    i hope to enroll samson in a program for therapy dogs where he will learn to visit patients in nursing homes and/or hospitals.    beside manners, the basic requirement is that the dog love people.    no problem for my big, lovable golden retriever!    we're still working on the manners.our pets are so eager to help; we learn so much from them.    when you find youself reading through the posts, think about how you can help.    you may not have all the answers, but a simple hello or a few kind words can be equally supportive. if it is your first time to post a comment, welcome aboard!!    if you are a veteran poster, thank you for your time and contributions!!if you have a pet(s) that has helped you cope with the stress and anxiety of dealing with a heart condition, please tell us a little about him or her.    they truly know the art of unconditional love and for that we are all grateful.conniecommunity leader

2750,my brother complained terrible pain on the back of his neck and terrible headache minutes later he collapsed is now in a coma blood flowed out of his mouth and nose hes still unconscious since yesterday how is his chances to survive
2751,i am 26 years old. almost 2 weeks ago i developed a sore throat, swollen tonsils (but no puss or pockets or fever) and slightly swollen lymph nodes under my jaw. i went to the clinic, took a strep test and it was negative. i was told it was either from the post nasal drip from my allergies or viral. she told me that if my sore throat didn't get any better by the 7th day from the first day of sympoms to take z-pac that she prescribed. the next day i woke up with all of the symptoms of a cold, runny nose, sneezing, cough but still no fever or puss pockets in my throat. that lasted for about 5 days.    by that time the cold was almost gone and the sore throat was gone but my tonsils were still swollen. i finished the 5 day z-pac yesterday (which would be the 13th day since symptoms appeared) but my tonsils are still swollen and red. my throat no longer hurts and the lymph nodes under my jaw are almost back to normal. there are no pus pockets or yellow suff on my tonsils. they are just red and swollen and a little painful. i have allergies and take claranix-d daily. can swollen tonsils be due to allergies? the only times i have ever had swollen tonsils is when i had strep years ago. if it was bacterial shouldn't it be almost gone by now from the meds?
2752,my girlfriend and i sometimes have outside partners, so we get tested for stds regularly in addition to using condoms.    so far our test results have been negative over three test cycles (once every six months).    this is great, except that something is starting to bother me.we both have had cold sores (aka oral hsv-1) in the past.    i don't think either of us has had an outbreak in the last year, but we both clearly remember the white bumps around the mouth that itched and went away after a few days (and was improved by over the counter herpes cremes).so how can we test negative using herpeselect elisa igg multiple times?    one false negative i could understand, but three (or six if you count both of us).    can i trust any of the test results?!    shouldn't we have hsv1 antibodies if we know we have had cold sores?    is there another hsv that also causes oral cold sores?we used tstd for the order and results.    the blood was drawn at two different local labs (owned by different companies).any ideas?
2753,i am planning on having a natural water birth delivery when the time comes in april. by being in the water, does it really relieve some of your pain and make it easier? i have heard that sometimes it does, but i do not know anyone who has ever had a water birth. just curious. thanks!
2754,i just saw a post where a 16 yr old is talking about there eye sinking in. mine is doing the same thing and i'm 30 yrs old. it started about a month ago and i can see a noticeable difference from one eye to the next. i too went to the eye dr. and he told me he could find nothing wrong with my vision. i can feel it in my nasal cavity when i touch my eye sometimes. i get the pains behind my eye, under it and in my eyebrow. my vision gets blurred and it's very uncomfortable when someone is standing up and i'm trying to look at them while sitting down. i found something called enophthalmos and silent sinus syndrome. could this be what is wrong?
2755,my husband has struggled with anxiety his whole life. it's always been in the back of his head, but recently he's hit rock bottom. he's been seeing a counselor for the last 2 months - and i think it's brought his anxiety to the forefront since he is focusing so much on it now. in the last 10 days, he has gone over the edge and he's realized that he needs to do more, so we went and saw his doctor who prescribed him zanax and zoloft. the issue is - he's not a pill popper. the man won't even take a tylenol for his worst headache. he's struggling to the point where he is now also depressed and thinks he's going to lose everything in the world. he has taken a few zanax, but he waits until his anxiety is through the roof before he takes it, then it doesn't work too well. he doesn't want to start taking the zoloft until this weekend when he is off from work because he's scared of what it could do to him.i guess the point of my writing this is - what can i do?? i feel so helpless and sad for him. he's never been like this and it will get better - i know it will, but he's just so desperate and bummed and i feel like there is nothing i can do. i'm supportive, i hold his hand, i tell him things will be okay, and i encourage him to take his meds. living with him is like walking on egg shells because i can't do anything right... and i know it's not me, i know it's his frustration that's talking. i get that. it's just the hardest thing to have to watch the person you love struggle so bad. so i'm asking you spouses that love someone with severe anxiety/depression and those of you who possibly have anxiety - what else can i do? this is the hardest thing ever. this is just the beginning and i know it'll get better, but to him his world is crashing down and he's hopeless. it's so sad. any suggestions?
2756,had    a biopsie yesterday ,told today was not cancer, but have a papillma in left breast is surgery a must.
2757,i woke up and my stomach was feeling nauseated. so i took some vitaminc. after a couple of minutes i noticed i was feeling thumps in my chest near were my heart is. then i put my hand on my chest to see if i would feel again. i did feel the thumps again and again. it occurs about every 30 heart beats.but sometimes if im walking it skips after 3 to 10 beats or somewhere between. i checked my pulse when it happens and its like my heart skips a beat. my nausea has lessened but is still there. what is wrong with me?i also have another question. i think i have cancer and i told my mom about it and she said i don't have cancer. my symptoms are nausea, not hungry most of the time, lack of motivation, a sensation where my liver is sometimes, when im lifting    weights or something that i use my muscles for my muscles start to shake a little. i was wondering if those are smptoms of cancer or could be, lymph node in my right side of my neck is bigger than normal is another symptom. i havent went to the doctor yet. my mom keeps on saying that its stress and i should not worry about it and overeacting.my question is could i have cancer?
2758,actually, i have had a herpes simplex about 6 month ago that cured 2 month later but red marks are still visible on my lips.in addition, i have been using anti-viruses for more than 3 month such as val acyclovir and i am definitely sure that the cycle is done since it has been 6 months.therefore, what is your opinion as an expert and what would you recommend me to do? moreover, for further information it seems to me that these red marks respond to the heat and to the sun by growing and expending in size.as an expert, do you think that kissing someone at this point might me harmful? will i be transferring the virus to that person?thank you in advance

2762,i recently had to start injecting bravelle intramuscularly in the hip/butt.    i was doing follistim sub-q, but had no response.    my question is does anyone have pain while injecting?    not the needle so much as when the liquid is injected, i can barely stand it!!!    me and dh have watched the instructional videos over and over so we know we're doing it right.    i called the re this morning and they said they've never had that complaint before about bravelle.    the sensation of it going into the muscle is just... unbearable.    and it lingers on a bit for almost 20 minutes afterward.i was wondering if anyone else has the same reaction.    i know bravelle isn't oil based like progesterone so it shouldn't be painful like this.    dh thought maybe he isn't getting all the air out of the needle before injecting.    anyone else have that happen with painful effects?
2763,i have been off the depo for a month and yesterday think i had a period, it was bright red compaired to the odd spotting i had been getting.    if this was a period it only lasted 1 day could i now be able to maybe fall pregnant, or was i just hoping it was my period.
2764,i'm a 37-year old male in excellent physical condition, swam in college and have been competing in triathlons for 15 years.    exactly 1 month ago i went for a 2-hour 35 mile bicycle ride in the blazing florida summer heat (i know, not the smartest move)    though i've trained in the heat before and brought fluids with me on the ride, the 100+ heat index took it's toll.    i ended up with extremely severe heat exhaustion toward the end of the ride, i probably should have went to the er following my return home.upon awaking the next day i had a severe, crushing headache with pressure.    four weeks after this incident i have sensations of vertigo when moving my head side to side, up or down, or bouncing my head such as when i run.....it's as if my eyes can't follow along with my head.    standing up after i've been sitting also creates this vertigo effect.    the vertigo also creates an unsteadiness to my balance. i've also noticed a feeling of pressure in the upper, inside corners of both my eyes and discomfort moving my eyes from side to side.    this vertigo has all but put a hold on my exercise as any head movement triggers the sensation.also of note, i assume as a side effect of the extreme heat exhaustion, i appear to have become heat intolerant.    any exposure to stagnant heat, even without exercise, and my heart rate shoots the roof along with associated dizziness.    during these episodes i just can't get my heart rate to come down and must quickly get into an air condtioned building.    almost called 911 as one time i nearly fainted.being i've never felt any of these symptoms before i fear the severe heat exhaustion/exertion has caused all this.    i went to a neurologist 3 weeks ago for a physical exam and mri of the brain and all came back ok.    neurologist just told me to rest.    my gp did blood work and all came back normal, blood pressure was normal, he recommended i see an ent specialist.could this be something vascular that occured in the brain that wasn't picked up on the mri?    could severe dehydration & heat exhaustion trigger these symptoms?    could the vertigo be due to a sinus infection or inner ear issue?    i'm concerned as i've never experienced vertigo like this before and never had a month-long headache before.    thanks for any advice!

2766,my maternal grandfather has always had problems sleeping, and my mother has inherited this to some degree, not helped by the fact that she works shifts. i first noticed i had trouble sleeping at age 11, roughly 6 years ago. i know it runs in the family, but mine is so much more severe than my mum and grandpa's. it has gotten to the stage now where i go several days without any sleep and then a couple of days where i sleep, but it is broken and filled with nightmares. my mental health is not great, but not as bad as it has previously been (where the only sleep i could ever get was drug-induced).i have just finished high school, where the problem was bad but manageable. i am due to start a job on thursday and it includes administering medications (to dogs and cats, but that's not the point), and i can't afford to be overtired and running on adrenaline.any suggestions or general feedback would be much appreciated.thanks

2769,hey guys sorry i have been out of the loop. my daughter was in the hospital again( whole other story) but i have a question. is it just me, or does this whole tiger woods thing stir up feelings in any of you who have been in his wife's situation? i have been doing so well. or at least trying to. my husband said he is trying to forget the past and it drives him nuts when i bring it up so i just bite the bullet but this thing is really eating at me.in our last session the therapist pulled out a pencil, he asked me what was on the top of it. of course i answered an eraser. he asked why. i said to erase mistakes. he said who ever invented it knew that there was a need for it. that mistakes would be made. you can cross them out but still have a mark that they are there or you can erase it and it is gone. so i realized he was telling me let it go. could have been worse so on sunday i went out and purchased two decorative erasers, that night gave one to my husband and one for myself. i was surprised when he teared up. i made a promise that i would no longer dwell on this situation but said if he ever did anything remotely like this again i was gone. but you can not turn on tv, radio or look at a paper without the whole tiger woods thing coming up. it has triggered so much emotion and distrust in me again. yesterday my husbands supervisor called our house by accident meant to call his cell #. i was at work but my daughter took the call. she freaked out on the woman b/c she saw that it was her dad's work #. knows this woman works there too, so when the sup. asked for joe, kate said why are you calling him. don't ever call him again. the supervisor was so apologetic. said who she was and had a blond moment and called the wrong #. my daughter felt so bad she called me crying. i realize this has effected her to. i think she see's me as weak because i am choosing to let it go.
2770,hi,    i'm new here and i had made another post in a different section that went unanswered i hope it doesn't happen to this one.i have been dealing with pain in my joints and severe headaches and inguinal hernias due to a rare connective tissue disorder (ehlers-danlos) i have some vascular involvement and extreme hyper-mobility in my joints and have dislocations all the time in most of my joints (elbows, shoulders, ankles, especially my hips because when they reset they slam down on a nerve or something and i can feel it shoot down my leg like a freakin lightning bolt ) of my joints.    i was just given a referral to a pain management doctor after this diagnosis was made and all the tests were run.in the meantime i have been put on 5/325 norco which do a decent job of getting rid of the pain, and anyone that has had chronic pain for a very long time knows that even decent reduction in pain is like a godsend.    however, i was told by my geneticist that the first step was going to be to find the right combination of medication to completely kill the pain, not just reduce it but 100% kill the pain, with this news came a mixed feeling of joy and apprehension.what i am worried about is, the last thing in the world i want is to be stuck on narcotic pain medication for the rest of my life ( i'm only 22! ), but given the choice between narcotic pain medication and the pain i've been in since i was 8, i'll take my chances with the medication.    i would like to know if anyone has ever been told similar news first step is to find the right combination of medication to kill the pain completely, and what was done, and again if god forbid i am stuck on this medication, how i fight becoming addicted.    anything else that may be helpful to me would also be great..i would very much appreciate input of any kind as i am very very new to doctors and this whole... process and am somewhat scared about certain aspects of all this.thank you very much.

2773,so, a while ago i had a dentist appointment.    it was for cleaning and one thing that was weird was, he put something in between my 2 front teeth and was like sawing in between them!    i didn't think anything of it, but a little while ago i noticed that my 2 front teeth had a gap!!!    i've always had straight teeth, and now there is a friggen gap in between them!    now, it's not a large gap, but enough to get me mad at what happened.    i'm wondering if anyone knows of dentists who do something like this or what, but it's really making me mad.    even one of my friends who i haven't seen in a while. told me wow, i never noticed you had a gap.    does anyone think that the dentist did this, or if somehow my teeth just naturally did that.    btw i'm 23.    if he had anything to do with this, he's going to get an earful.

2775,i just have one sex partner: my wife. however, 4 days ago in a very stupid act i went to a strippers club and ended up having intercourse with one of the girls. i used a condom but i am still very worried and this is the reason:i could not properly do it, did not have a proper erection and was really drunk. she put the rubber on me and i did not check if it was properly done. not that i could tell, since i had only had my wife as sex partner until then and had never used a condom in my life. since i wasn't having an erection i tried to masturbate with the condom on after i had tried to penetrate her (thus i touched the used outside of the condom), and after getting a better erection i tried to do it again. plus i was really drunk and don't know for sure how much contact i had with her fluids. next day, about 7 hours after the contact i masturbated (was still drunk and not thinking clear yet).besides the obvious guilt and regret i am very worried about being infected. i already know that i could have infected myself by the masturbation. how high is the probability of this being so? what about the probability of getting hiv in this way?    any thoughts? what should i do?i do feel some discomfort in my groin, and i've been having to pee very often my penis looks ok and i don't have any obvious signs of a disease (no weird secretions or red areas etc). any help would be greatly appreciated. please help!nicolas
2776,so today me and my girlfriend were having intercourse when i pulled out (i was wearing a condom) and the condom got stuck and the semen came out. she was on top so the semen fell onto me but i'm still a bit worried. my question is what are the chances of her getting pregnant because of this? she has been on birth control for about 3 months now. answers would be very much appreciated. thank you!
2777,hello friends,i had three embryos transfered on march 1st and had a positive beta on march 12th.    the amount of hcg detected was 334. on march 14th, the hcg level had risen to 584.    because it didn't double, my clinic wants me to take a third beta on monday, march 17th.     my hcg levels increased 75% in exactly 48 hours.    i thought that was normal since (according to the research i have done) the hcg levels typically double every 48 to 72 hours.    has anyone else had a similar hcg progression with a favorable outcome?    please let me know.thank you!singlemum

2782,i am very frustrated concerning my 38 year old daughter. she has mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation. they have been watching it for some time now doing echo's and tee's. the cardiologist    says that it is getting worse now , it has become severe and she started to look for options for surgery. her insurance won't let her go outside nys so she cant go to cleveland clinic where her dr. wanted her to go. the hospital that was chosen was strong memorial in rochester ny. well she had the consult and actually set up surgery thinking that both leaflets in the valves are shot and that they would be repaired. the surgeon reviewed the previous tests and he did an echo and he is not in agreement with my daughter's cardiologist he feels that it is moderate and not severe. he told us that you never do heart surgery to early because of the risks and you have to watch to make sure you don't do it late either. they wanted her to do a stress echo which she just did. that was what his findings were that he feels it is just moderate and not time to do the surgery.when she had the stress echo done the dr. told her that when she started she had all these extra beats that were all over the place and she should have that looked into. i need to give you some past on my daughter. she went into cardiac arrest 4 years ago. they feel it seemed like because her potassium was low. it was a miracle that she pulled out of it. it happened when she was driving her four small children. they implanted a defibrillator and nothing has happened since. the cardiologist looked at her stress echo and had another dr look at her results and he said that with her past history, he feels she may have brugada syndrome and wants her to look into this. we have gone from one bad thing to another. what i am searching for is what tests are done to find out if you have this? are they accurate tests or dangerous? has anyone ever had heart surgery with this disorder and have had positive results from it. any help would be greatly appreciated please.

2788,i have been diagnosed with small vessel disease of the brain after a cat scan with contrasting dye showed several white spots in the frontal lobe. ms was ruled out with a lumbar puncture. the rheumatologist suggested it may be caused by sjogren's which i have had for twenty-five years. my neurologist has prescribed 500mg depokote once a day with a pain pill as a back up for the headaches which sent me to the doctor. he gave me no information and said to do anything i wanted to do. i asked specifically about travel which i do regularly. he told me that there was no reason not to continue this. based on my research, i could have a stroke at any time which could be a problem traveling. is this an accurate assessment of my situation?

2792,i'm posting this seperately from a below thread.    my fear is that a link may cause a thread to be deleted (as i've seen in some threads).    i don't want that to happen.there should be increasing information and evaluation about this news in the upcoming days and weeks.    it suggests that the drug works, works well, and that talks for phase 3 looks promising.    to the management; my apologies if posting this breaks rules.-willyhttp://www.reuters.com/article/marketsnews/idukn2520323020070725?rpc=44update 1-vertex shares leap on hepatitis c drug datawed jul 25, 2007 12:54pm edtby bill berkrotnew york, july 25 (reuters) - the shares of biotechnology company vertex pharmaceuticals inc (vrtx.o: quote, profile, research) rose 10 percent on wednesday as additional information about its closely watched experimental hepatitis c drug reassured investors about its chances of success.vertex, after the market closed on tuesday, provided interim data from an analysis of a clinical trial that showed fewer than 10 percent of patients who had undetectable levels of the virus after completing 24 weeks of therapy had relapsed by the end of 12 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.we view this as very impressive data and a significant de-risking event, as post-treatment relapse rate was previously the biggest unknown, leerink swann analyst howard liang said in a report.sanford bernstein analyst geoffrey porges noted the less than 10 percent relapse rate seen with the drug, telaprevir, or vx-950, compares with roughly 30 percent seen in standard of care studies.this difference is the basis for the likely clinical trial superiority of telaprevir, porges said in a research note.porges, who is encouraging clients to buy vertex shares, expects that telaprevir will indeed be a major breakthrough in the treatment of hepatitis c virus.while the company did not divulge the sustained virologic response (svr) -- the percentage of patients in whom the virus remained below detectable levels -- in the latest data release, analysts said the data suggest the svr rate could be roughly 65 percent to 75 percent.an svr rate higher than 50 percent is considered to be very positive and 75 percent would be viewed as a home run, analysts said. the additional data also continue to suggest that adding telaprevir to standard therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin would substantially cut down and possibly halve the required length of therapy from the current 12 months.more data is expected to be unveiled in november and analysts said vertex remained on track to begin late-stage clinical trials of the drug by the end of the year.but needham analyst mark monane remained cautious about overly optimistic timelines and said he does not expect vertex to submit an application seeking approval with u.s. regulators until mid-2010.monane said data to be presented in the second half of the year, will not add substantially to what is already known about (telaprevir) and consequently do not foresee a meaningful upside opportunity in the stock this fall.at its current price, we believe the stock fully reflects telaprevir's potential, added monane, who maintained a hold rating on vertex stock.the cambridge, massachusetts, company's shares were up $3.02, or 10.2 percent, at $32.74 in nasdaq trading at midday.

2798,my 5 year old son just started kindergarten 2 weeks ago. i have had a problem with him wetting his pants for awhile now. it comes and goes sometimes he wets everyday and sometimes he will not wet for weeks. when he wets it is not like he completly wet his pants it is like he leaked and just the front is wet. this does not bug him at all. he claims that he does not even feel that he is a bit wet. i have taken him to the doctor and had him tested for everything. his doctor put him on ditropan. i did not use it because he stoped wetting his pants. now he is wetting at school everday. i do not know what to do. the school wants him in pull ups and he refuses to go to school if i put one on him. the doctor said to give him the medicine but i dont think that he needs it because this just comes and goes. i have tried everything from not saying anything to him about wetting to taking things away, offering rewards, doing stickers. what do i do!!!!
2799,sorry that my story is a bit long. i'll try to leave out some details even though i think they could be helpful.i'm lucky if i can produce 10 minutes of useful work in a day. the task that i need to complete is to finish up the development of software that i've worked on for years. most days now i get as far as opening it up and looking at it, then i just stop. i wouldn't say that my mind is blank, but i'm more like a deer in the headlights. i know what i have to do but i just can't start it. this has gotten worst over the past 3 to 7 years or so. i'm probably within 40 hours of programming to complete many years of work but i can't do it. the software has been committed to be delivered by the end of the month to customers whom have already paid for it.as background: i'm in my early 50s with two young kids at home and my wife does our sales so we work together. i lost a valuable business after 9/11 along with our house, cars, boats, etc. i've been a very driven person but i can no longer see past the next hour anymore. we are almost broke now with just enough money to pay what's required to release the software or for a major home or auto expense, whichever comes first. my growing inability to function like this started or began to show itself mostly over the past 3 to 7 years.i get my care from the va which seems adequate. i had a pacemaker implant about 6 years ago and that may be about when things slowly started getting worst. (i knew i would end up with a pacemaker for years in advance.) about the same time as the implant, i simply stopped sleeping. i get tired but don't sleep. after many years, i've found a balance of alprazalam and moving to different locations at night that now get me enough sleep. i also take gabapentin for nerve pain which seems to have improved some long standing bi-polar problems. i've also recently started on methylphenidate which has helped my memory. i've also been diagnosed with cerebral atrophy but because of the pacemaker, i can't get an mri and the va doesn't give more information than 'you've got it'.working with the va can be slow and it's difficult to work with the psychiatrist. i pretty much have to tell her i want xyz and convince her to let me 'try' something. i did take a battery of psychology exams a few years ago and appear to have passed with flying colors.i think my problems are a combination of clinical and social but i need to try to find a way to get over this hump to start making an income or my family will be homeless.any actionable suggestions are greatly appreciated.
2800,dear all,my child, 19 months old, is diagnosed having hydronephrosis.chronology: the 1st time found during prenancy 6 mth by usg screening but it's considered mild & expected to be able to improve by himself. when he was born on august, 2006, our dr saw no problem at that time.he then developed fever on dec 17, up    to 39c. our dr was suspected caused by uti, proved by lab test that the number of e.coli bacteria was 10^5. he was fine after taking antibiotic (madlexin). then we when through another uss on dec 23 and the result is mild bilateral hydronephosis, grade 1&2. he has been 4 times checked by uss. first time at 4months of age which left kidney showed hydronephrosis 11.7mm, at 7 months 9.5mm, at 1 year 9.3mm, at 15 months 9.8 mm, at 19 month 12mm. the right kidney was improving, at 4 months, it showed hydronephrosis 9.2mm, at 7 mth 5mm, at 1 yr 2.3mm, our uss dr said it is normal now. mcu has been done at 5 mths of age showed no vu reflux bilateral, no posterior uretheral valve. mag 3 has been carried out 3 month ago and showed upj obstuction on the left kidney. based on mag-3 scan result, the dr    recommends the baby to go to upj blockage surgery (pyeloplasty). for the moment, the baby is taking antibiotic, amoxicillin.to prevent any infection.we are really not keen to let the baby go for surgery and we would like to seek advice/opinionwhether there is any other option we can pursue.many thanks before.

2802,i am taking a day or two off.    my mom is increasingly short of breath and we found out last night (yes, her pcp called her last night at home!)    she has fairly large pleural effusions (collection of fluid in the chest cavity outside the lungs).    this is restricting the spece she has to expand her lungs for breathing.    she will need to have it tapped off, both for relief (though it would likely come back) and for diagnosis.    the three likely causes are infection (but no symptoms of that), autoimmune (again no other symptoms) and cancer ( :(( )    i am very worried.    i am close to her.besides that i am too zapped to sit at the computer and post.    too much activity yesterday.i know i owe several people posts and if i feel better later i will.please!    this is not a request for sympathy or attention.    it's just when i drop off the board people always wonder where i am and i don't want anyone to worry.    just letting you know.daughter quixxie
2803,it's been over a year now since i started with multiple symptons. i started to bloat, i have pain in my stomach and also on my right ovary. my legs seems to hurt more and my back also. after running different test on me they decided it was my gall bladder. here's what i don't get. according to my doctors i've had a cycst on my right ovary for over a year.i know i'm prone to cyst but they won't do anything about it.i've had them rupture so i know what it feels like. they have ran different types of test on me and they can't figure out what is going on with me. i've gone to a gi specialist just to be told that my gallbladder was good and they should have never touched it to begin with. my mother was 35 years old when they diagnosed her with ovarion cancer. when i asked the doctor if i should worry about this he said no. this isn't something that could run in the family.right now i'm scared. my periods are very heavy and my stomach seems so bloated and i'm uncomfortable. it seems like i'm always in pain. my cramping is so bad    now that i even call in to work. i feel like i'm going crazy or that's how they have made me feel. i don't know what else to do.. i've read the symptons on ovarion cancer and it's the exact symptons that i'm having.    am i crazy??

2806,has anyone had eye problems.    my eyes pop open really wide and they hurt.    they burn and it is hard to focus at times because of the popping wide and hurting.    i am using naturual eye drops.    my endo asked me if my eyes were burning.    they were better then but a few days later they started giving me problems.    i would appreciate any help you can give.    it scares me for something to be wrong with my eyes.     he mentioned there was an eye disease associated with thyroid, but that was all he said.     thank you all.     this forum has been a life saver to me.    i usually read it but don't write.    linda
2807,for the past 2 days i have the urgency to wee a lot ,and also pressure on my bladder but it does not hurt
2808,i am a 27 year old female. smoker (though trying to quit), but normalish health wise. for about 3 months now i have noticed a pain, right in the soft spot at the top of the jaw, directly behind my ear lobe. when it started it was infrequent and lasted only a few minutes and was only mildly annoying. now it happens every day, pretty much all day, though it is worse at night. it is a pulsing/stabing pain. when it's happening i press hard on the area and try to massage it out but it doesn't help. it pulses painfully for a few minutes, then stops, then starts again a few minutes later. about 3 weeks ago i developed a sore throat (which has not gone away), extreme fatigue and nasal congestion. that took me down for a solid week, but the fatigue and nasal congestion have gone away, leaving only the sore throat (which is worst at night and upon waking). in the last few days my jaw has become stiff and is painful when i open wide. the sore throat is on the opposite side of the jaw pain. i am going to go to the urgent care on monday, but i am hoping someone can shed some light on what all of this might mean. help?
2809,i have slight raised swelling around the opening of my penis that seems to flare up after oral and vaginal sex.    i have recently been treated for epididymitis with levaquin and had been on doxycycline for acne for two months prior to this.    i do not have any discharge and i have not had any frequent urination problems either.    there is occasional itching at the opening that comes and goes.    does this sound like chlamydia or gon?    is there any other cause for this?
2810,i've been bbt charting for 5 months now. from that, i have been able to determine that i have a short luteal phase. (never more than 10/11 days) during my lp, my temps also start dropping by about dpo5/6. this cycle, i started taking a b6-12 vitamin. i ovulated on cd22, and also started using a otc progesterone cream 1/8 tsp/2x daily. within a couple of days, my breasts and nipples became very sore and tender. i also started feeling extremely tired, and was urinating frequently. i had frequent headaches and at times felt dizzy. my temps rose and i am now at dpo11. my temps have remained elevated and above my coverline, though they started to go down slightly today. i did a pregnancy test today, because today would have been the day my period would have come, and it came back negative. also, my breasts are not as tender today. is this normal using a progesterone cream? can it mimic symptoms of pregnancy? was today too early to test for pregnancy? at the dosage that i am taking of the progesterone cream, will my period come on it's own, or should i stop taking the cream by a certain time period?
2811,i am 26.    5'11 and 196 lbs.    i work out 3 days a week.    i attend a spin class for one hour per day three days per week.    i have been doing this for more than a month now.    i have lost nothing.    i am constantly tired despite getting 7 hours of sleep each night. i am getting frustrated.    any suggestions?
2812,i have been wearing contacts for a few years now, and the other day i noticed my eye was kind of red (saturday). i figured it would go away after i took my contacts out and put in a few eye drops.    but it is now tuesday (3 days later) and it is still kind of red, and with a closer look i noticed that there is a very small whitish dot on the edge of my iris.    my eye feels pretty normal, should i be worried?    do you think it will heal/go away on its own if i wear my glasses instead?
2813,at this mornings ultrasound they said there were 3 follicles around 12 and they would probably trigger monday morning and then timed intercourse following!    they said everything looked great..the only slight concern was my estrogen level was elevating a bit quicker then the follicles...they said they like to see around 16 for a trigger..how does this sound? does it make sense? is 3 follicles good at this point??
2814,good evening doctor,i recently got tested for all types of std's as my boyfriend and i would like to start planning for children in the near future (2 yrs). i was tested for everything on my visit, including hsv1/2 and hiv/aids. i came back negative for everything except hsv2? i spent nearly 1/2 hour with my doctor asking how? i have never had any type of outbreak (lesion/genitalwart) or common symtoms(symptoms)of this std? she mentioned my results were so low , that it could be a false positive?i am so anxious and concerned with future planning for a baby; is it a good idea for me to send away for the western blot test? i have seen so many images and articles of those who have this who have to deliver by c-section due to outbreaks.    granted, my boyfriend has had hsv1 since a child and i am wondering if this could have led to my positive results for hsv2?this discussion is related togenital herpes... could i have it?.
2815,so i was on the deposit shot for almost 2+ years and naturally my period stopped. i have been off deposit now for almost 1 year now and my period still has not come back. i get cramps like i'm going to but i never do. my question is is it still possible for me to get pregnant at this time? or am i just broken :( i really need to put my mind at ese
2816,every since i had my son 18 months ago, i have developed this urge to constantly rub my teeth. i do it to hear that squeaky noise and i'm at peace when i do it, like nothing else matters, as long as i can rub my teeth and hear the noise i'm ok. my husband thinks it's really annoying and he often gets upset when i do it, he thinks i'm ruining my teeth, but i can't stop. i've tried but it seems impossible... is there something wrong with me? could i possibly have ocd?
2817,i came here looking for answers regarding the rai scan i just had done and i'm leaving with only more questions. i went to the health pages, and it appears that the procedure there follows what i had done 7 years ago. according to my doctor, this is no longer the procedure. i was given thyrogen shots so that i would not have to go without my medication. i continued my normal, daily routine. i didn't have to go on a low iodine diet, either. i was researching because i found conflicting stories on whether you could eat beforehand or not, since i was not told that i couldn't; i was concerned that this could effect the outcome. has anyone else had an rai scan done, recently?
2818,my son is getting very frustrated that he is unable to run even at a slow pace without going into atrial fib. dr. prescribed inderal prn for a-fib without conversion on it's own. sometimes my son takes it because his hr is 150 for 30minutes after a run and the inderal does convert him. it has been on year, he has taken inderal only 5 times. but he is wondering if their is something else to do or just stop running completely.
2819,my dr didn't say anything about an eye exam, but i figured since i was having problems i should get one.    i went in today and told them i needed a baseline eye exam cause i was gonna be txing soon.    after we were all done she told me to come back in a month(after starting tx) and get a baseline.    i'm very confused!!    i thought that's what we were doing today!?!?    she also didn't bother fitting me for new glasses even though i told her the ones i have don't fit right.    so, does the baseline need to be done before or after starting tx?    if after, then how long should i be on it before i get my eyes checked?    has anyone else been asked to come back for it?    she also told me to call if i had flashes, floaters, or darkening in my vision.    those are the exact things i told her i was already having????
2820,im in so much pain on my left side of my chest is it all comin from my frozen shoulder ive tried all the tablets i can take i am even goin to reflexology to see will it help please help what can i do next

2822,just before 3 weeks i had terrible sharp pain below chest    which was later followed by nausea and then feeling of lump in the throat    (swallowing trouble) and then panic jerks while sleeping. suddenly my eyes are also staying dry and cannot read properly. my mornings use to start worse and at    nights i ended up better. dr. prescribed me with nexium 40mg per day along with some tests (glucose/ldl/trigycerid were little abnormal). before 3 days i did slow jogging for a mile and shockingly ever since then my throat problem has escalated along with severe nausea which now stays even at nights. i feel weak and sleepy but when i try to sleep it gives terrible panic jerks and wakes me up. on my 2nd visit dr. visually checked my throat viewing inside the mouth and inspected by pressing the throat from outside and increased nexium to twice a day and prescribed thyroid test whose results yet to come.(i had the same situation before 10 years, i had done biopsy/barium/endoscopy all came to be negative with just minor stomach inflamation(inflammation). i was depressed and    lost about 30 pounds. for 1 year they treated me with antacids, depression pills, consulation    for panic attacks with not much help until i moved to a different city and surprisingly all the symptoms disappeared completely.)not sure if i have gerd or something else (sometimes i do feel stomach burning now), i feel terrible, depressed and cannot affort to stay like this too long again. i need to know if anyone has gone through this situation before and is there any cure or answer for this ?
2823,i am a 42 year old female. following agressive treatment and 6 week coma due to a burst brain aneurysm in 2007, i developed a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. gammagt rose to 2800, at which point, an ercp was undertaken to clear the scar tissue in the bile ducts. over the next 18 months, gammagt went down to around 60. however in the past few months it crept up to 173 again, then 2 weeks ago, i had a perforated appendix with an infection that had already spread in 3 quadrants. following appendectomy, i was treated with iv antibiotics for 7 days. all appears to be healing well and blood work suggests infection has gone. gammagt though has gone up to 450 again. could this be the result (before appendix perforation and after) of the infection and antibiotics required? any advice or information much appreciated. thank you.
2824,im having troublee with my son and boundries with our friends daughter and taking things from her purse i dont know what to do or how to handle it
2825,hello.    i'm a 53 year old man in otherwise good shape.    i'm a tad overweight, 6'1'', 211 lbs.    i have always worked out at least four times per week.    in december, i had a cat scan which indicated an ascending aortic aneurysm of 4.7 cm.    my older sister and nephew have recently both had this condition and were both surgically treated (hers was around 5.7 and his was over 6 cm).    my gp called me today and said that he wanted me to see a cardio vascular surgeon for monitoring and possible treatments (i guess down the road).    my question is this:    because i'm in an hmo and my gp is my gatekeeper (but a great doc) should i get my referral to see a cardio vascular surgeon or a cardiologist?    wouldn't a cardiologist be a better quarterback for all heart related treatment approaches?    or, because we know i have the aneurysm, should i go straight to the surgeon?
2826,i am being worked up for chest pains/discomfort. i have periods feelings of a feeling of being punched in the center of the chest (between by breasts) which lasts for a few seconds to a few minutes.    i have never had any radiating pain and this always happens at rest. this has been happening for about 7 months.i also get a fluttering feeling, not at the same time as the above symptom, that lasts for seconds to minutes, take my breath away, might happen several times a day, or i might not have the feeling for a couple weeks.    i have had 2 negative ekgs and a negative stress test.    i can't ever get to a health professional while i am actually having the smptoms because they only last for seconds to a few minutes.    the longest period i have gone with daily symptoms is three weeks, but due to the hmo system i could not get to a cardiologist in time to get a holter.    i was not going through any unusual stress during this period.    now i haven't had the syptoms(symptoms)for 2-3 weeks, finally got into a cardiologist and she is saying she thinks it is stress arrythmias.    we are waiting for approval for a holter monitor & she told me to contact the office when i have the fluttering, but like i said, it only lasts a few seconds.    what test can be done to catch these symptoms?how serious are arrythmias? can this lead to a heart attack? these symptoms don't happen when i'm stressed out so why would it be stress arrythmias?
2827,my granddaughter aged 3 is fully toilet trained but has started soiling indiscriminately in her toyroom.    mum is very upset and shouting at her and dad is totally perplexed and doesn't know what to do.    i have advised them to just clean it up, clean her up, and then carry on as usual.    i have also said that they should discreetly withdraw treats but not actively punish her.    i am not sure about my advice and wonder if this behaviour is common or if there is something more serious going on.
2828,can anyone describe the physical    pain that comes from w/d to tramadol? im experiencing arm/hand and leg/feet pain 8 days in still and im wondering if this is normal wd pain or if its my old viral friend coming back for another round.

2830,i'm on birth control and i am on my last week of pills...and i always, and i mean always start my period on either monday night or tuesday morning. its thursday and still no period. i don't have any of the usual pms symptoms. i haven't felt sick or had to pee any more than usual...should i take a pregnancy test? me and my boyfriend live together and i don't want to freak him out if it is not necessary. and i couldn't do something like that behind his back...so should i wait a few days or take one asap? ahhh!
2831,i was left with no choice but to complain about a group of surly medical personnel at my cardiac surgeon doctor's office. well, i must/need to undergo an echo-stress test because i desperately need brain surgery for trigeminal    neuralgia, a neuropathic disease. once...again! on the day of the echo-stress exam i    faced retaliation and was 'ganged' up by 3 female workers. i asked the gal to close the privacy curtain several times, and it was never done. the testing area is for both genders. the head-charge nurse of the office was called into my testing room from several doors away and they 'appeared' to have that knocking around, ganging up of me all planned out due to my previous fax message to the md.she yelled at me do you want to take this test or not? well.. i must have that test, or no surgery since i've already had two (2) heart attacks.i fell frozen and very silent and suddenly remembered the un-wanted sexual abuse i endured one hot summer as an adolescent from an family member. it's that same rotten gut feeling, like biting into an apple with a worm inside. my breasts were wide open on that table just like in my bed that morning when i was 12 years old. i froze up! omg, not only did i endure un-provoked sexual advances from the most cherished male of my family, but my breasts were intentionally left wide open again for the whole world to view me in that vulnerable position again! i kept covering my breasts up and they kept pulling the gown off of my breasts! to make matters worst, the younger gal was told to 'take charge' of me and she sand-papered the hell out of my skin. i told them sand-papering was unnecessary ( i have dry-dry skin, and allergic to adhesives) and she took delight in doing it even harder! i still feel the shock of that morning from both experiences, and depressed feelings are haunting me all over & once again. this new experience is just as bad as that summer morning, and even worst, because i kept saying no< no< no!i can't sleep, i'm in worst pain, and    feel as denigrated all over again by my own gender. i also think the charge nurse is a drunk as well as a lesbian. where do i begin? the last time i complained via fax to the md about the surly mentality,    i met this fierce gang of females taking what should be a simple echo-stress test. they also insisted that i leave my purse outside of the testing room which was totally unnecessary as there are hooks on the wall for clothes & purses. i know that if given the chance my purse including all of my ids would get passed around & ripped off by at least one of them. it's just the attitude in the air that one gets, you know the types, those gang mentality's exist in every office setting, and lately more prominent in medical settings. who should i write to now? the hospital will protect the workers, not the patients, i do not want to sue them, i want a formal apology and they should collectively all lose their jobs. who should i make an appointment with at the center? the administration, or the doctor again, or should i make a statement to the police department. i had been violated in a doctor's office and this wasn't the first time. it happened the first time i ever saw a gynecologists at 18 years old. the doctor began to talk 'dirty' to me and i quickly left to never return. as females, we must protect ourselves from    men, now we have to protect ourselves from lesbian drunks at our doctors office too at every turn?    any suggestions would surely help this overwhelming depressed feelings that linger in my loving home.

2833,i had a d&c approx 5 years ago. recently i've had some issues with my cervix which caused me to go to a specialist for some testing. during the exam, the doctor noted that my uterus was 6 weeks in size. unfortunately i was told this via a letter, so i couldnt' ask him what that meant. could this be related to the d&c, and does anyone know if this affects anything down the line when it comes to pregnancy or disease? thank you!

2840,ok!    so every time i feel like i may be balancing out with my moods, i have to upgrade my dosage.    the first time i increased, i was manic for a week then crashed.    the second upgrade i was already down and got more down.    i am just starting to come back up and feel ok, to only increase again tomorrow.    i am really nervous about what will happen and how i will be.    during my second upgrade, my rage was out of control.    i had never felt that way before with such passion.    i am definetly seeing some positive things on this medication, like the voices have stopped and i can actually get out of bed.    i don't cry and i actually can shower and go to work.    but i am unsure what normal actually feels like and therefore have no way of knowing if this is as good as it gets.    then of course, i think of my manic days and i want them back.    i want my energy.    i am reading the book, i'm not crazy just bipolar    it is an awesome autobiography.    she really explained how i feel depressed and manic in my own words.    amazing.    i am trying to get all the information i can and read all the time.    i check on here all the time and then i feel like i am getting obsessed.    i just feel like there is a glimmer of hope in getting better, but it is always just out of reach.    i can remember crying at the age of twelve because i was so depressed i wanted to die.    i remember having panic attacks and breakdowns and no one able to help me or understand.    i was afraid of everything and struggled with depression.    i lost friends and jobs and family.    i then turned seriously mainc during college.    experimenting with men and drugs to ease the pain.    for once i was not sad.    this lasted for a long time and i have been living this rollercoaster for too long.    i just want to get off.    why did it take so long for anyone to notice what was wrong with me?    why did noone help?    i have so many questions and just want to be happy with going to work and coming home and being normal    i don't want to stress about the unorganized closet or the cupboards that need painting and reorganizing.    i don't want to count and recount my money to be sure there is enough or stay awake wondering how i will get everything done if i keep sleeping.    then i want no fog and i want to feel - being numb *****!

2842,i have been spitting up phlem for 4 weeks, my sinuses are always congested and full of yellow phlem and my neck often hurts. i have taken musinex dm, cough sirups, and i keep my throat moist by sucking on cough drops constantly. i have ra and get remicaid iv infusions every six weeks. i also take methotrexate and other drugs like plaquinil daily. i have taken    antibiotics like amoxcicillin, 250mg, 3 times a day, for 10 days, and i just finished a 7 day treatment of levaquin, 500 mg a day. i had a throat culture and chest xray done, and they are both negative for bacteria. my tonsils are covered in white mucus and my throat is a bit soar. i do not have a fever. could i have tuberculosis. what is this?
2843,i apologize for the lengthyness of this article, but find it best to be thorough with medical inquiries.in 2001 (age 13), i was prescribed prednisone for arthritic symptoms, and within six months i gained approximately 40 pounds. increasing amounts of the medication quickly became ineffective. the highest dose i recall taking regularly was 20mg. ever since, i have struggled with my weight.my normal body temperature regularly came out well below 98.6 (96.8-97.5) and i became very sensitive to the cold. i dieted and exercised extensively during my first two years of high school to no avail. my junior year (age 16) i began crash-dieting, and quickly progressed to restrictive eating wherein i regularly consumed fewer than 500 calories daily. the only times at which i have returned to a normal weight and build for my body are when i have regularly consumed fewer than 800 calories daily, though i know this is unhealthy and my bmi predicts my caloric intake ought to be double that. after i ceased my restrictive behavior i began regaining weight (approximately 10 pounds per year). while this weight gain has been frustrating, i have largely attributed it to beginning college.this past academic year (age 20) i remained steadily at 150lbs. within the past month however, i have gained 15lbs. while i concede that my stress level may not have helped, my eating and exercise habits did not change significantly during this time and i have regularly undergone similar levels of stress without drastic weight gain. i have had a full menstrual cycle and am not pregnant. i have not begun or ceased any medications whatsoever. i have also become increasingly anxious/irritable, prone to headaches and acid reflux, and sensitive to the cold.i am very concerned about this sudden increase in weight, as well as irritated by my steady weight gain since being prescribed prednisone, and was wondering if this might have a physical root in the thyroid.
2844,if i do the littles work my body gets tired fast and aways in pain . i get this weird feeling in arms and hands (right side ). what is it and what can i do ?
2845,hi. feb 2010 i noticed a small red growth at the tip of urethra.(outer opening). it was sensitive when i was peeing.    but then stated with mild itchy or tingling sensation.i informed doctor. 4 days after this visit i developed burning sensation in the urethra.it was reduced with oflox 250 mg.

2846,hi there,i just had a miscarriage last month and had a d&c. that was three weeks ago. i was wondering when i should be expecting my period? i always had very regular cycles before so i'm hoping they will return to normal soon. the last few days i have had some very mild cramping and even more mild spotting. i'm not even sure i can even call it spotting because it has been one teeny tiny spot a day. i don't think it's my period, but more of the light bleeding after the d&c. i'm a little confused at this point. any ideas??carisa

2855,hello,i have been having transient double vision and blurring of vision.    i have my eyes examined every year.    this year prism lenses were necessary.    what would cause double vision like this?    it is really pronounced when i am lying down or looking laterally.    i notice that when i read i usually close my right eye.
2856,this past week, i noticed that my 6 month old baby's eyes are noticeably different sizes (but the pupils are the same size).    it seems like she has no vision problems with either eye.    should i take her to an ophthalmologist for further investigation?thank you in advance.

2858,levi johnston takes back his apology to palin46 minutes agohttp://www.comcast.net/articles/news-general/20100826/us.tv.levi.johnston/file - in this aug. 8, 2010 file photo, levi johnston arrives at the teen ch...anchorage, alaska    levi johnston, the father of sarah palin's grandson, says he wishes he hadn't apologized for telling lies about the former alaska governor because he's never lied about anything.johnston said in an interview on cbs' the early show to air friday that he wishes that he hadn't issued the apology to palin.i don't really regret anything, johnston said, who has appeared nude on the cover of playgirl. but the only thing i wish i wouldn't have done is put out that apology 'cause it kind of makes me sound like a liar. and i've never lied about anything. so that's probably the only thing. the rest of the stuff i can live with.cbs said the interview was taped thursday in los angeles.johnston is the two-time fiance of palin's eldest daughter, bristol, and the father of bristol's son tripp. bristol palin's teen pregnancy thrusted the couple into the national spotlight during sarah palin's run as the gop's vice presidential candidate in 2008.johnston has expressed an interest in politics, filing papers last week to run for office in his hometown of wasilla, alaska, next year.while he has not officially declared which political office he aspires to, his manager, tank jones, has said johnston is interested in a run for mayor or city council. earlier this month, jones confirmed the 20-year-old johnston planned to run for office as part of a reality tv show.wasilla is where palin got her political start, first as a council member and then as mayor.johnston said he hopes he could be a better mayor of wasilla than palin. i can't guarantee or promise you anything but i'm gonna try... that's the goal, he said.___online:http://www.cbs.com/

2861,i have been taking loestrin 24 for about 7 months now. before then i was taking sprintec. when on sprintec i was moody, overly emotional and reacted to things in a very dramatic way- cried all the time. then i switched to loestrin. i became less emotional but still emotional and started to gain rapid weight (20lbs in the past 7 months). my doctor orriginally said b12 supplements would help my emotions but its not. i still cry. it seems i am only emotional an hour after i take my pill (at night) and something happens that i just dont agree with... i want to take b12 shots to see if that would be better. is it ok to take b12 with loestrin. i am going to my dr on monday but i felt i wanted to know so that my hopes can either be up or down lol. thanks.

2866,well to start the story i am underweight due to my being sick with a mixture of ibs and anxiety the past three years. so i am 19 years old and 6' 4 142 lbs. no pec muscles do to my anxiety keeping me from going out of the house the past few years. i'm allergic to milk so i don't get the calcium i should. now we found my dog dead this morning and when i saw my brother i blamed him for letting him out to get hit by a car. and when i did he pushed me down and i got up in a rage and went to punch him. my dad pulled us apart and some where in the shuffle i got punched square in the chest/sternum on the left side and since my chest has been hurting. when i rub a certain location i cause more pain that feels like a bruise right in between two ribs. i took an advil and it hasn't really touched the pain. should i be worried? is it safe to try to sleep?
2867,hey everyone :)i'm 24, and if have two kids .i had a abortion (surgical) on 30th april, they messed up and i had to have a second op on june 16th, and every since then i have been so tight . i don't know if it may have something to do with it .me and my bf (who is well sized) are very sexually active, and have sex up to 11times through the night if he stays over . he struggles to get it in, every time . he loves it thou, but i feel like i'm losing my virginity every time . it's ok when it gets going but i always feel slightly swollen and torn days to follow .and it's not like i'm dried up, as he gets me very wet .does anyone else stuffer from a tight vargina??
2868,hello, i have tried using oral contraceptives with progesterone and estrogen to feel safer when something goes wrong with condoms, but about 25 days after the start of treatment, i started to have folliculitis in the hip region (buttocks and groin). they are many and big. i usually do not shave my buttocks, then i exclude the possibility of a problem related to that. i've tried changing the medicine to try another kinds of estrogen, but the problem persists and now i'm trying one that is based only progestrone. i'm afraid to go wrong with this one too and not remain me any options. i wonder what has caused this and what should i do? i do not want to depend solely on condoms because they can burst.

2871,my 5yr.old son is having a very hard time making friends he has a weight problem which we are working on at this moment so he cant keep up with the other kids in his class. he is a very shy child and the neighborhood we live in has no other children for him to play with, he is not used to being around other kids so he is to scared to talk to the other kids when he finally worked up the nerve to ask another child to play with him the little boy didn't want to play with him. my son has bi-polar & adhd (a bad connection) so he's on medication to help him but unfortunately the bi-polar medication doesn't seem to be helping. one day i decided to peek in on him while he was at recess and when i seen him out there i almost started to cry he was walking around with his head down crying he seen me and took off running to me i had to take him back over there even though i really wanted to take him home. from what he tells me he does that every day at recess,also when he comes home all he wants to do is sleep i ask him how how his day went and he say it was bad and begs me not to make him go back tomorrow. if anyone has any advice on my situation please,please help i open for any suggestion's and/or advice.                                                                                                                thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        a desperate mother
2872,hi!    i just started taking birth control (loestrin24fe) on sunday and continued on monday and then quit because this just wasn't a good time for me to be taking a pill every day.    so i only took two pills and then thursday night my period started.    i had actually just had my normal period the week before.    this one is much lighter than usual.    i didn't think just two pills would mess my cycle up.however, i'm going out of town next weekend (7 days from now) and i really really really don't want to be on my period then.    will this period last that long?    my normal period is only 5 days long.    my period was only like a week ago so could there have been that much build up of blood in that time?my other question is if i start taking the pills again today, will that help stop this other period?    i would stay on them this time as i plan to start using them in the near future.    i just don't want to do anything to prolong it, not sure if starting the pills again might do that.    thanks for any advice!
2873,my    5 year old kid is not interested in going to school. this a very well established school and has good rating and feedback from parents. kid is not able to follow rules and direction. i had thought of behaviour or disciplinary schools but was not able to locate one near sanjose, sanfrancisco area. i had doubts of attention related issues and had explored this, but priliminary evaluations indicate she is fine and does not have a attention deficit problem and she simply might not be intrested in following guidelines. this is affecting her schooling and she belongs to the do not listen category. for she to be remotely successful, she has to be able to follow directions. would you be able to suggest a best approach to evaluate and help her..

2875,i am 34 years female. i got married 6 months back. i did not get periods from last 2 to 3 months. before that i was advised to take lupigest tablets by a gynaecologist. i took those and then after that i got    periods but had very less bleeding. yet i am waiting for my periods. now i am taking m2 tone tabs from last 15 days. yet i have got no signs of periods. i am worried please help me.
2876,i was shocked to read the news last week in a newspaper that a mother threw her children from a skywalk in mumbai. isn  t it shocking to hear that? how could a mother do such a criminal activity? i also read in a business magazine that unplanned pregnancies are taking a big toll on the population. as high as 60% pregnancies unplanned? i really do not know whether its a fact or not but in a country like india this is devastating. with a plethora of contraceptive measures available why are we not able to get what we want? you have options for both male or female. and even if its the typical carried-away moment, the i-pills of the world are always available at the next door chemist. why do people do not understand this simple procedure or are we so confident of ourselves and claim of knowing our bodies & time intercourse accordingly? i hope the new generation    the young india awakens to using contraceptive measures in a more positive manner and are completely aware of regular to emergency contraception. that  s the need of the hour!
2877,im 12 years old and i put my contact in a couple of months ago and wen i tried to take it out it wouldnt come out but even on the first day i tried to get it out the vision in the eye was still bad, and now i try putting soulution in it and rubbing it but it wont come out also i still have bad vision in that eye and i dont think its there but when i feel across my pupill i feel somethin on it and i cant get it off please help im scared and havent told my mom because she will kill me literally and i want to take care off the problem myselfp.s. i think its off but i just have an iratation wich feels like its there but thats just me.
2878,hi everyone,i need some suggestions for a valid work from home job- i need to raise some money for my ivf treatment. already had a fresh and frozen cycle fail, so we need to try again. thanks
2879,soo i posted a question about herpes before let me explain my story. back in october i got tested for everything in my blood it was just a checkup it wasn't because i was sexually active or anthing. anyways the results    came out negative for hsv1 and hsv2. i' just realized this now because a took i really good look at my results back then i didnt care because i wasnt in a relationship or ever been sexually active or anything so i knew i didn't have an std lol. probably within a month later i made out with this guy    the only guy i kissed within the month after my test    probably for lik 10 minutes. lol i'm 19 btw. anyways i was under alot of stress that    week also i couldn't sleep wasn't eating right i was crying alot i was really depressed / stressed out that week i felt me getting sick because of all my stress.within a week later i started to develope something inside my mouth not my lips it was weird i felt a slight tingling and then i looked inside my mouth i saw a small shallow ulcer it was inside my mouth it wasn't on my gums or the roof of my mouth it was like on the really soft part of    my mouth like when you pull down ur lip that soft part. idk why but the first thing that came to my mind was a coldsore    i showed my mom and she told me thats not a cold sore idk what that is but it's not a coldsore considering i got tested for hsv1 and it came back negative a month prior to this you would think it's not a coldsore but i was ignorant and had no idea what hsv1 was. it hurt when i talked and ate it was unbearable and i had lip swelling so i went to the doctor and told her i think this a coldsore! lol i just told her she looked at it quickly and agreed. my point is i feel lik the doctor was wrong this happen over 7 months ago i started researching and i think what i had was a canker sore. i told my mom about it and she says she never thought it was a coldsore she felt the doctor was wrong. canker sores i read can be triggered because of stress can cause lip swelling and appear in the mouth coldsores can appear inside the mouth also however (rarely) but even then it's usally on the gums,hard pallette or roof of the mouth. mine was on the soft part of my mouth when you pull your lip down. i did have tingling but i read canker sores also can give you a tingling feeling before they start. i'm almost 100% sure it was a canker sore but you know the doctor said it was a coldsore. in my testing results i came out negative for the coldsore virus but then a month later i get a coldsore i feel like there's no sense in that. i mean i did make out with one guy after those tests but he had no sores or anything or his lips.however that's why i feel the    doctor can be    wrong. i did my research on coldsores and cankersore and from the description i gave you guys here i'm almost 100 percent sure it was a cankersore. if the doctor was wrong honestly i'm furious because she had me thinking i had oral herpes when i didn't but anyways can anyone put some input for me here i would like to get some opinions and help me i can't talk to my mom about this lol    btw the reason why i care so much is because i'm now in a serious relationship it's been 4 months just recently about a week ago i made him get tested so if we get sexually active i know he's clean. my boyfriend came out completley clean for everything including hsv1 and hsv2. ( he's the only guy i kissed after the cankersore or whatever it was lol )that's why i care so much. i'm pretty sure i'm hsv1 negative now but i    also just want input. thankyouu =)
2880,is it suposed to hurt when my daughter feeds? shes 1 day old n my first, ive been exclusivly breast feeding. in the hospital they said she was latchin properly but it hurts when shes sucking
2881,i adopted my foster son when he was almost 2 yo.    he was born addicted to cocaine and tested + for marajuana.    he is 4 now and is just about to dx with adhd and odd.    he has global developmental delays and his behavior is very exhausting.    he will be receiving inhome support and will be transfering from his developmental preschool to a behavioral preschool soon where he will receive more therapy.    in the mean time, what can we do at home to try to help his behavior?    he refuses to use the potty ( and he can) and leaves poopy diapers all over the house.    i feel like i am constantly on a poopy diaper scavenger hunt.    time outs are a joke to him and his fake screaming/ crying are getting really hard to ignore.    any suggestions?    foster parent training hasn't addressed this issue to my knowledge.
2882,my sister called me today and is very worried about a cyst she has on her right ovary.    she's been trying to get pregnant for almost a year now.    her obgyn says that the reason she can't get pregnant is because of the ovarian cyst on her right ovary and that she should be find once    it is removed.    he believes that the cyst does not have any entwined blood vessels or anything, so he should be able to save the ovary.my question is:    even if there is a cyst on her right ovary, shouldn't the left ovary still be healthy and ovulating?    we have an aunt who had problems with ovarian cysts, but the doctor is saying it's probably because she was on the birth control pill for about four years, but i'm wondering if maybe it isn't hereditary.    i don't know what to tell her and she's really worried.    she's having her surgery at the end of this month, so we'll see what happens.has this happened to anyone else?    can anyone offer advice?    thanks!
2883,please, i have had cysts in both of my breast and other places  . within the last 11 months, i have had 2 surgeries to remove cysts in my left breast.    point is the cyst caused no pain and now i have constant pain in my left breast   both breast has pain but i can ignore it  . however, the left is getting worse. now i do not want pain meds but maybe some herbs to help (rub on or something) thanks for your time and help in advance.

2889,my mil called me last night from the hospital and they admitted her because of hernias. she has already had like 12 hernia repair surgeries. her normal surgeon that had done all the other ones told her that he would not do it because she is to high risk (diabetic) and that she is too fat!! doctors words!! you are too fat. are you kidding me??my mil is 4'11'' and she has breasts that weigh about 35 lbs apeice. her family doc has written multipul letters to title 19 (she is on disability because of the hernias) to try to get them to pay for a breast reduction. they refuse! for some reason they would rather keep paying for hernia surgeries than eliminate the main cause of them.my question is....is there anything that any of you ladies know about that we would be able to do to get her that reduction?? i would pay for it if i had the money, but unfortunately, i don't. i know it's completely ot but right now i am desperate to help this wonderful woman out.thank you!!

2891,has anyone tried accuweight?    you have beads put behind your ear and rub them 40 times every odd hour.    stimulated hypothalumus to think you are not hungry and not cutting calories.    you have 1 1/2 lb veggies and 2 servings fruit each day for 2 days and 20 oz of milk each day for two days and back to veggies days and so forth.    it is a quick way to loss weight and since your body doesnt realized it has had it calories cut so dramatically you are being very healthy.. you body starts eating at the bad fat and leaves alone the good fat.this is how it was explained to me.people have lost 95 lbs in 6 months... and kept it off for years.anyone?
2892,i am to schedule surgery to remove a cyst. my doctor told me he would have to burn 30 percent of the inside of my uterus to get it all out. my fear is not the surgery itself but something i was told (by someone i can't recall who) about the procedure. i was told my vagina will smell like burning flesh. yikes... i don't know about this, the whole thing scares me. if it does end up smelling as bad as i have been told, my biggest question now is... for how long?    i need this surgery, i have heavy ,heavy, did i say heavy.. bleeding atleast 2 times a month and the pain is like a red hot knife sticking thru me. anyone , please help. i can't seem to find any info on the subject on the net. a hysterectomy is out of the question.
2893,i was checking my cervix the other day while in the shower and i felt this small bump on my cervix. i'm pretty freaked out about it honestly, i'm terrified that it's cancer or something.another thing i experienced was ewcm, but this shouldn't happen since im due for af in 2 days. im having usual period symptoms, extremely painful breasts, sever mood swings, slight cramping.but i'm wondering if their can be any connection with my random ewcm and the bump or what it could be. i have an obg appointment in 4 days but since im due for af im not sure how good the exam will be, so im nervous.anyways, thanks for listening to my rant and please if anyone has any information
2894,i was wondering how long in your pregnancy do you have to be for it to show up on a pregnancy test.i've been trying to figure out when i conceived my son.because of moving circumstances i wasn't able to see a doctor till last week thursday.she did an ultrasound and by the measurements of the ultrasound she said that i was due nov.8.i don't think it's accurate for the simple fact that a positive pregnancy test came up on the fourteenth of feburary of this year.i remember my lmp being around the third or fourth of jan of 08.i figured that if my due date was to be nov.8 that    would mean that i would have conceived between the 11 to 15 of feburary and if that was the case my test wouldn't have been             positive on the 14th of the same month.that's why i'm wondering how far along do you have to be in a pregnancy for your test to show up.i also took a home pregnancy test the beginning of feburary not sure what day and those two test also came up positive.can anyone help me to when i conceived?
2895,hi i have an almost 3 yr old boy.    very active doesnt realy cry about his boo boos that he gets every day but recently ive noticed him complaining about his hands hurt and tonight he began with his knees hurting, even woke up an hour into his sleep crying about his knee hurting.     a few days ago i thought maybe its for attention but know im starting to feel a little worried since he is being woken up in his sleep from knee pain.    he never cries about little falls and scrapes but with these pains he actualy cries and im begining to feel worried.    could this be growing pains?
2896,my daughter who is 4 1/2 year old all of a sudden started having problems with anyone cutting her nails. a month ago i could do it and not have a problem. i have never cut them too short or hurt her. but now i just mention cutting her nails and she panics and screams and won't hold still. she screams so hard she gets blood blister spots on her face.    and trying while she is sleeping is not possible since she is a light sleeper. i don't know what caused this change but i need help to fix it. i've tried candy, letteing her cut mine, promise to paint them after, nothing works. please help.
2897,my son is 9 years old and just recently (within the last few weeks) started having irrational fears.    he has to sleep bathed in light from head to toe, with his door open, and persists to ask every night to sleep in my 6 year old daughter's room and for me to leave my door open.    he wakes up several times a night crying and then won't go back to sleep.    we end up waking up in the morning and he's either on the couch or in my daughter's room and all the lights in the house are on.    when i ask him what he is afraid of, he says he doesn't know and that he's just scared.    i've tried to play it off like it is a cry for attention, but he is actually scared.    last night he woke up at two in the morning, paced around the house, and then woke my daughter up at 4 am.    he never went back to sleep.    it's even gone so far that now he will not go to the front bathroom, he insists on showering and using the restroom in my bathroom and only if i am in the room.    if he calls for me and i don't answer quickly he will literally jump out of the shower and run around the house looking for me freaking out.    i'm not sure where any of this is coming from!

2900,why are members of the secular media soft on muslims but merciless on christians ,the answer is simpler than you think its cowardice,fear of swift islamic retribution and retaliation has kept the secular media in the west hiding in their proverbial 'foxholes' fear is a very powerful    fact of life ,attacking christians has become fashionable ,you need only to read the bbcs website on any given    day ,you will find countless examples of condemnation of chistians around the globe .it is safer to pick on christians,after all the essence of their faith is love , forgiveness and peacemaking.they would never respond in the same fashion to their muslim counterparts .the secular media has come to realise that their accusations will not be challenged since the tenants of the christian faith are to love our enemies and bless our persecutors .
2901,i'm taking birth control pills but sorta started my period last week (while i was still taking the last week of pills). it was really light though but today i started cramping and all of a sudden i have a heavy flow. this would of been and should of been the time that im supposed to get my period. the cramping and everything is normal except the fact that i had this super light bleeding that lasted from last week up until now. im sure this period will only last my usual 5-6 days. im hoping anyways. but i dont understand why i was light bleeding for a week. does anyone know for sure if it will stop as soon as i start taking my next pack (next sunday) and/or has anyone ever experienced this sort of problem? thanks soo much!

2903,im a newbie and wanted to ask to those who have had success w/ iui and injectables. did ya'll do consecutive cycles or did you take off for x number of cycles?been ttc for 10 years on and off. last dec. we started the iui/injectables. before that i was getting acupuncture treatments for a year without success.this would be our last hurrah, so to speak and we're thinking 2 or 3 cycles. so one down. anyway, since this is our last ditch effort, i wanted to know how i could maximize this and would like to know if it would be better to wait and rest for a cycle or two or just do a consecutive one.any info and shared experience will be much appreciated.good luck to everyone!

2911,there is an old rule called the 80/20 rule, that 20% of people will use 80% of a resource. seems like when it comes to medical care its even more skewed.http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090401/ap_on_re_us/frequent_er_patients_3austin, texas    just nine people accounted for nearly 2,700 of the emergency room visits in the austin area during the past six years at a cost of $3 million to taxpayers and others, according to a report. the patients went to hospital emergency rooms 2,678 times from 2003 through 2008, said the report from the nonprofit integrated care collaboration, a group of health care providers who care for low-income and uninsured patients.

2913,i have noticed in many patients and peoples that despite good oral hygiene with regular brushing, flossing, massage, and following various healthy activities for teeth they tend to have regular gum bleeding which may be worsened during constipation and usually improve with flagyl or ornidazole intake which indicates that bacteria plays a major role in gum health or there is any particular blood disorder beside from. scurvy, which causes gum bleeding in these type of person.    in homoeopathy, there are some medicine which works for whom who has a general bleeding tendency i.e. phosphorus.do these person suffers mainly due to bad denture?
2914,hello,over the last few months, i've noticed a progression of odd behavior from my 8yr old daughter.    it started awhile back with questions about whether i loved her more or my husband more (remarried 2.5yrs ago), and she would also ask her dad that question about her or his new wife.    another thing she started doing was putting things in lists, whether it be friends, toys, movies, etc.    which one she liked first, then 2nd, 3rd so on.    she also repeats statements and questions two or more times.    the latest thing is that she has started saying that she feels like she likes someone better than me but she actually likes me better.    this has been family, friends and even people she sees on tv.    she has also said she feels like i'm stupid for doing a particular thing, but she knows i'm not stupid.    she tells me these different things several times a day.    the only time she isn't talking about these things is if she is distracted by other activities.    these last two things are making her very distraught.    she is saying that she doesn't want to think these thoughts but she can't help it.    i don't know what to do.    one of us is going to go crazy if i don't figure out how to solve this!any advice??thanks!

2922,first national tea party convention in nashville, tn, last night...    this judge roy moore was on fire !    he cited such patriots as thomas paine, james madison, samuel adams and patrick henry and he received four standing ovations during his impassioned speech.    this guy, roy moore, is running for governor of alabama.he then began to paraphrase the declaration of independence. but rather than addressing grievances to the king of britain, moore presented obama with his own bill of particulars:he has ignored our history and our heritage, arrogantly declaring to the world that we are no longer a christian nation. he's elevated immorality to a new level, setting aside the entire month of june last to celebrate gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender pride.he now threatens to change our law, 10 u.s.c. section 654, to allow homosexuality in our military in direct opposition to the law which says that the attempt to engage in homosexuality will create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.he has apologized to the arab world for our past, subjugated our national sovereignty by bowing down to the king of saudi arabia.he has pursued a socialist agenda by taking control of private companies and pushing a national health-care plan with a public option. backed by a willing congress, he has bought off our senators and our representatives with our own money in an effort to mandate this agenda. and when opposed by members of the senate, he smugly smiled and said, i won.moore concluded his list with a direct quote from the declaration: a prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.***posted: february 05, 201011:50 pm eastern on wnd.com***
2923,cc'ed the nutrition and ear nose throat forums;as some already know i have a condition where my ear feels full 24/7/365.    however some times it is fuller than other times...    the last couple-three months i have come to understand that specific foods can make your ear feel very full such as salt and caffeine.    i just had an apple and 15-20 minutes later my ear felt extremely full and brain fog came about where i could not concentrate at all on what i was attempting to do.    my question is, could an apple do this and what in the apple would do it?
2924,hi!i am asking regarding my cousin,she is 5 years old. i have also children 9 and 5 years but not any problem with them and can't understand if it's her behavior normal. this summer we spent one week together    holiday but never again. she is sometimes normal but very often she has like crises and she doesn't know what she is doing: screaming, looking on the top and her eyes are going around, taking cloths off, braking things(chairs and what ever). what ever parents says to her it is the same. they can't control her no with angry, no with nice words. nothing! i tried    to ask her what she wants to do, why she is doing this. she doesn't answer, she looks at me but like she doesn't see me. i can repeat 3 times the question for example: do you love your mum? she doesn't answer. like she doesn't hear me or she doesn't understand. even when she is normal she doesn't speak understandable, she doesn't understand that danger things (if she goes to road that car will hit her), she eat's everything what she see down on the street, in the toilet...last year she had tuberkuloses.i tried to explain her mum that maybe she needs some help for this strange behavoir but nothing. what do you thing? is that only bad behavior or something more.best regards,hrikos

2926,so a while ago, this trollop my husband was trying to  help    made some baked goods for him. and my husband was soproud and rubbed it my face.now, my co-worker , has offered to bake some yummy baked goods for me.    this co-worker is just a co-worker. we consorteach other on our work related duties, and occasionally share a big laugh or two.this co-worker cooks all the time and brings things to work. his, making this tasty treat for me is not indicative of any romantic feelings.fyi: it is true that what comes around goes around.    thus far, i have had all opportunity to behave like my husband.i can proudly say that the vast majority of the time -i was the bigger person( like when i saw the poor pathetic- fashion sensed, deprived girl out in public one day- i did not accost her. i simply ignored the evil-guttersnipe. i did it    very well too i might add)but really, i just wanted to know what you guys think. i will probably just share it with my colleagues.now i want to know what you guys think i should i do :

2928,washington (afp)    new claims for us unemployment benefits jumped more than expected last week, official data showed thursday on the eve of the key june jobs report.initial claims for jobless benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 472,000 in the week ending june 26, an increase of 13,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 459,000, the labor department said.the leap was sharply higher than the consensus analyst forecast of 458,000 claims.the four-week moving average, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, rose 0.7 percent to 466,500.the trend has generally been moving higher in recent weeks, suggesting that the labor market is perhaps starting to weaken, said andrew gledhill at moody's economy.com.in the previous week ending june 19, the insured unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, unchanged from the prior week's revised rate, the department said.the number of people collecting unemployment insurance benefits in the week to june 19 rose by 43,000 to 4,616,000, while the four-week moving average slipped 0.5 percent to 4,567,500.gledhill called recent moves in claims troubling.in typical job market recoveries, claims would be much lower -- below 400,000 -- but in the current situation they have remained stubbornly elevated. part of the explanation is that hiring is very low, potentially prompting a greater share of unemployed than is typical to file for benefits coming out of a recession.the weekly jobless claims data came on the eve of the department's key june jobs report, widely expected to show worsening conditions.most analysts expect the data friday will show the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent in may, and the economy shed 100,000 nonfarm jobs after adding 431,000 in the prior month, mainly temporary government jobs for the 2010 census.
2929,i've been trying to get pregnant for the past 3 years and do far no luck. the doctors have done so many test to find out why, to make story short, the diagnose me with small cyst then 2 years later with a small fibroid, which they said that that could be the reason, so the send me to a fertility and they did the hsg that came out great no tubes close. so, on sept i started taking conception tea, i been using it for a month an half and next month the doctors want me to start with my first treatment of clomid 50mg. my question is if anyone knows if i clould take the conception tea and clomid together?
2930,i had my thyroid radiated several years ago and i am on synthroid. my current dose is 137, 5 and 1/2 pills a week. i just had my third failed ivf cycle(i did achieve pregnancy in dec. and miscarried at 7 weeks). the problem is my thyroid is under 2 at the beginning of the cycle and 6 weeks later was 3.54. i know the birth control pill does interfere with the thyroid levels. so how do i keep my thyroid in range while i am on the bcp, lupron, menopur and gonal-f. so, how do i figure out how much to increase the dose of synthroid while i am on these meds?
2931,hi, im kinda new to this... well i took 3 pregnancy test on monday and they all came out positive within a minute. my last period was feb 15, so i think im 8 weeks. im a junior in college and i already have one child, so im just scared of having another baby... i dont know if this is right forum for this but im just terrified of having a another baby. i decided not to have an abortion, because im morally against it and i feel like i need to take responsibility for my actions. i told the guy (mind you we are not together and never were) and he flipped out and doesnt want anything to do with it... so now im terrified and im going to have to go through this pregnancy alone. if you have any words of wisdom or advice i would love to hear some comforting words right now. thanx
2932,had iv month ago (surgery).    notice where iv (nurse called it a pic line) went in -a lump -lump feels hard and moves -like something plastic is inside my arm right under my skin.    i feel no pain and lump is visible also a little bruise on the skin right where lump is.    what could this be -should i be concerned?
2933,hello ladies! i'm 37 weeks pregnant and have dialated 1cm, cramping a lot. i have read on here that many have had ultrasounds later in pregnancy, but i honestly haven't had one since early in my last trimester. is that normal, or should i say something to the doctor? i have a different doctor with this pregnancy than i had with my last, the last one did many throughout. i am getting nervous now that we're nearing the end. i just want her to be healthy!
2934,just a quick question for you ladies.    what do you think my chances of getting preggo are when i had sex on the days that i was ovulating but my dh pulled out?? im having some extreme fatigue, back ache and some random nausia, and af is due on sat. thanks in advance for you responses!!
2935,im trying to concieve(conceive)and me and my husband had unprotcted sex on aug 30-aug 2nd i ovulated aug 3rd and latelly my breast has been hurting and haveing a weird tingling feeling in them..i got my period a week early i got it on aug 13th could this be implantation bleeding? when can i take    a pregnancy test???
2936,i had some thoughts that i might be pregnant because of few weeks of break in contraception but as i started to take my pill again, i had no symptoms of pregnancy. i come on my period and on the first bleed i think i've might passed down something like product of conception. but there was no strong pain stomach. just a normal pain in stomach and in back. what is the tissue which i've passsed down? could it be a poroduct of conception or something else and what it could be ? i'm really confused about it but can't stop thinking what it was...
2937,this is to the ones thats trying ttc. hopefully this will help u all.if you are on a 28 day cycle, your most fertile time can be 14 days after the first day of your last af....but if you are irregular that is not the case....the period of time from the first day of a woman's period and ovulation can vary greatly, it's the leutal phase(time from ovulation to menstruation) that doesn't vary as greatly....a woman usually always starts her period 10 to 16 days after ovulation. so if you have a 25 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from cd9 to cd 15.....if you have a 30 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from cd 14 to cd 20. if you have a 35 day cycle you could ovulate anywhere from cd19 to cd 25.....and this could vary from month to month, but it will usually be somewhere within that time frame...also, your body could go haywire one month and not ovulate til really late or ovulate really early...but then you should expect your period to either come really late(for late ovulation) or really early(for early ovulation) as that 10 to 16 day period doesn't change. i hope this makes sense!
2938,i just had two positive home pregnancy tests and my friend did a test on me that checks for a baby's heart beat. fetal monitor test i think is what the name for it is. anyways.. it showed a heart beat of 130, which is supposedly normal for a baby. i couldn't get in the doctor today, so i took another test that showed negative? i'm confused, the only thing i know about pregnancy really is i've had one miscarrige. i have felt different lately, i just don't know what to think after having the negative test.
2939,hi ladies,i am trying to get pregnant, and have been monitoring my ovulation date. i got my period on march 15. as of today, i haven't detected the lh surge using the ovulation kits. i am worrying that maybe i am having an anovulatory cycle. when should i expect to see the lh surge? please help.thanks
2940,i have been in pain since feb 06.    it started with a very sharp pain on both sides of pelvic.    i went to the er and ct scan showed two cyst on both overies.    i think it was just due to ovulation.    when i went to the gyn he did us and they were gone.    since then my cycles have been very irregular.    they come twice a month sometimes and sometimes not at all.    i had a lap done and the doc found nothing but scar tissue and it was removed.    the pain is still there.    it is worse days after my cycle and continues.    it almost feel like labor pain and cramps combined.    last week i had another us and the the nurse just told me that my uterus was bulgy.    whatever that means.    she said i would have to wait and talk to the doc.    i have an appt tomarrow.    i am just so tired of been in pain and not knowing what is wrong.    i have also had a full work up with gastro,(prev. polyps).    but everything ck out ok.    i am always tired and sometimes can't get out of bed because of pain and fatigue.    what is wrong with me?
2941,my 12 year old went for his annual eye exam with an optometrist.    she noted on dilated exam rt. fovea appears redish and slightly swollen.    positive for mild metamorphopsia on amsler grid, temporal aspect.    she has referred him to an ophthalmologist.    can you please translate?    what does this mean?
2942,at a party the day after i returned from a camping trip in the jungle in belize i experienced binocular diplopia.    i'd had no alcohol to drink.    someone took me home but i have no memory of that, promptly fell into a deep sleep and woke up several hours later.    another episode occurred two days later and a third two weeks after that.    the third time i again fell into a deep sleep for about 45 minutes afterwards though i feel alert while the double vision is happening.    it goes away if i close either eye.    otherwise i feel fine.    after the third episode i went to the er.    i was told i was having mild seizures.    an mri, mra and spinal tap were all neg as was a f/u eeg.    what next?    do i assume this is just some bug i picked up in the jungle and will resolve itself?    are there any other diagnostic studies that should be done? how long before it is safe to drive again?

2951,hello i told my boyfriend of 14 yrs that 7 years ago i had been attracted to a few other guys because they were nice to me when he wasn't. we had started out great with lots of romance and passion, but he moved 40 miles from me about 6 months into it. things weren't the same. he changed. he told me i was perfect, but then he started talking about girls he thought were cute, and he started looking more at porn. he told me he wasn't, and he told me he didn't like other girls but he did. this was years ago, and i don't care. we now have been very honest about these things. but i feel guilty about the past all the time. now that i told him that i was attracted to these guys, i feel worse. he said he doesn't want to hear about it anymore, or he will leave me. if u all don't remember me, i was the one. who kissed a girl around the same time in my life and still feel guilty everyday for it. does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this guilt go away, i can't live like this anymore. i can't see a counselor, i can't afford it. please if anyone can help.
2952,hey everyone...congratulations to all of us on our pregnancies - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or more! hahahai'm wondering if anyone else has had their 3 hour glucose test yet, or if anyone else has been diagnosed with gd this early in a pregnancy. my obgyn called and left a voicemail on my phone friday night and told me a) i have gd, and b) my iron levels are too high so i can't take my prenatal vitamins anymore. i'm completely unimpressed that he did that and totally left me hanging as everything is closed for the weekend! i can't get any questions answered, any clarification, nothing. i don't know what to do, what not to do, how to eat, etc. i have a lovely friend on here who gave me some tips that i'm very grateful for that, but i'm hoping someone else can help me out too - the more information the better i would think!    he said i should be expecting a phone call from the diabetes nurse but i don't know when and most things are closed between christmas and new years around here too so unless they squeeze me in this week i'll be waiting until january at the earliest to see anyone about this!    this has me very upset which is definitely not good for baby!also, the high iron levels, has anyone ever experienced that? i haven't been taking my prenatal vitamins since he phoned and have been taking 5mg of folic acid and some vitamin d that i had already been taking on top of my prenatal but i don't know what other vitamins i should be taking. the beginning of the pregnancy is so important i don't want anything to end badly because i didn't get the right vitamins or nutrients! any help would be greatly appreciated!
2953,christine o'donnell is considering challenging sen. chris coons (d-del.) in 2014. (ap photo/rob carr, file)christine o'donnell's 2010 run for senate in delaware has become a cautionary tea party tale. riding a wave of tea party anger, she defeated the more moderate rep. mike castle in the gop primary -- who was believed to have the best shot at winning in the general election -- only to then lose to democrat chris coons.but o'donnell wants another run.according to delaware online, o'donnell is considering a rematch with coons, now the state's junior senator, when he is up for reelection in 2014.i think i owe that to my supporters, to at least consider a run,   o'donnell said in an interview last week. people sacrificed. not only came out of their comfort zone -- sacrificed to work hard in order to win the primary. and i think that i owe it to them to give it every consideration.o'donnell's most recent project was headlining the troublemaker film festival in tampa, fla. during the republican national convention.last year, o'donnell -- best known for saying she had dabbled in witchcraft and then assuring voters that she was not a witch in a campaign ad -- endorsed mitt romney's presidential campaign.responding to her support, romney said in a statement, christine has been a leader in the conservative movement for many years. he added, christine recognizes that excessive government threatens us now and threatens future generations, and i am pleased to have her on my team.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/16/christine-odonnell-2014-senate_n_1888022.html?1347808511
2954,i have excruciating pain in the upper portion of both my breasts. i wear a 44dd, could the problem be that i have gotten older and the sagging has caused the muscle to stretch and tear or is something more serious?

2956,police found 18 mutilated, headless bodies near a lake popular with tourists and american retirees just outside guadalajara, mexico, a massacre that authorities blamed on the zetas drug cartel.a phone call alerted police to two vans on a dirt road near lake chapala early wednesday morning. when police opened the van, they found 18 headless and dismembered bodies inside. some were so badly mutilated that police have still not determined their gender. the bodies appear to have been refrigerated after death.handwritten messages were found in the van. they are clearly messages between rival groups that are in conflict, said tomas coronado, prosecutor for the state of jalisco. officials said the notes were signed by the zetas.photos of mexican drug cartel violence.los zetas have been battling the jalisco new generation gang, a minor cartel allied with the sinaloa cartel, which is the zetas chief rival for dominance of the mexican drug trade. the zetas cartel, which was founded by ex-members of the mexican military, controls most of eastern mexico and much of the north.a woman detained yesterday in connection with the separate kidnapping of 12 people in the same area told police that the abductions were connected to events in tamaulipas state. two dozen men and women were found decapitated or hanging from bridges in nuevo laredo, on the border with texas, on friday, where the zetas are battling the gulf cartel, another sinaloa cartel ally.http://abcnews.go.com/blotter/18-headless-bodies-mexico-tourist-area/story?id=16320937

2961,my daughter has been ill for four weeks. she was admitted into hospital after two weeks of a diarroeah for one week, vomiting for another week. then she had a sore throat and a temperature of 39.9. she was put on a drip for dehydration and had her wbc checked which came back at 300. she had a clear result from her urine and a scan of her bowel suggested a slight inflammation, as did her bladder, but no conclusive diagnosis. she has a bloated stomach and has done for months. she is also very pale and tired. she was discharged from hospital as her fever dropped. it is now 39 again, she has developed a cough and is wheezy. she has been on both iv and oral antibiotics for 2 weeks but is still not better. i am concerned that her wbc was not re-taken after her fever came down and that such a high level may be indicative of something else. what should i do now?
2962,if you're moving to a newly built house, say goodbye to mail delivery at your door.and if some house republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away.the u.s. postal service is marching towards a more centralized delivery, where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments.in the past year, the cash-strapped postal service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery.but rep. darrell issa, the california republican leading the house effort to save the postal service, wants more. he has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box.a balanced approach to saving the postal service means allowing usps to adapt to america's changing use of mail, said issa, who is chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee.moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. right now, 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep.it costs $353 per stop for a delivery in most american cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. by contrast, curbside mail box delivery costs $224, while cluster boxes cost $160, according to a report from the postal service's office of inspector general.delivering mail is the agency's largest fixed cost -- $30 billion. ending such door deliveries would save $4.5 billion a year. that's more than the $3 billion it would have saved from ending saturday mail service, according to government reports.related: los angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bitesthat's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the greeting card association, which supports saturday service.but unions say it's a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled.it's madness, said jim sauber, chief of staff for the national association of letter carriers. the idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in buffalo, new york, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.yet postal officials say everything's on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. earlier this year, it tried to end saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision.usps fails to deliver $5.5 billionusps fails to deliver $5.5 billionthe postal service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more americans move to electronic billing and e-mailing.in 2012, the agency lost $16 billion. last year, the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling $11 billion. the agency has also exhausted a $15 billion line of credit from the u.s. treasury.ending a congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency's woes.as it awaits for help from congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. one of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments.prior to this spring, we'd work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery --- now the postal service makes that decision, said postal service spokeswoman sue brennan.related: wave of federal retirees to hit governmentin cranberry, pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in april from the postal service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments.community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes.we understand what's driving this is a cost savings, said cranberry township manager jerry andree. but you can't just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.for now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or congress changes the law, said steven hutkins, a professor of literature at new york university, and a postal service expert.the big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers, said hutkins, who writes the blog save the post office.http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/23/news/economy/postal-home-delivery/index.html?iid=h_e_news

2965,my dd is 7 weeks today.    she started out on simalac and she was real fussy and having some projectile vamiting so dr. said it could be an allergy so she told me to try soy so i tryed good start soy and she was very gassy so she said try neutremigen because that is what my first dd was on.    she has been on that since 3 weeks old.    she still has her colicy symptoms.    she sleeps good but when she is awake most of the time she is crying.    she acts like she is starving even after you feed her and she is very hard to burb and having gas even with gas drops and she still vomits a few times a week.    a friend told me her ds had the same problem she put him on simalac with low iron and he was totaly diffrent.    i called my dr. office and asked about changing to that and the nurse told me to come in and talk to the dr.    i just started back to work this week so i can't really take off right now.    what do you girls think?

2967,hi i have been to the dr due to the lack of menstrual cycle i usually only have 3 periods in a year this has been the way it has always been. i have had a daughter so i know i can get pregnant but the dr did a blood test and found that my testosterone levels were ok but there were other male hormones that were high and my female hormones were low and she has sent a refferal to a gynacologist to see if i have pcos as she said that she thinks i have this. question is i know that from what i have read they do a internal scan to check your ovaries but due to sexual abuse as a child i find this sort of thing distressing and i know that the dr i will see is going to be a male. how important is it to be checked out. i do not wish to have more children so im not worried in that respect but can this cause any other problems that i need to have checked out and if so. is there an alternate to an internal scan. any advice be greatfullt appreciated

2970,may 25, 2010relations between north and south korea deteriorated to their worst condition in years as pyongyang announced it would cut all ties with seoul and expel some south koreans working at a joint industrial park in the border city of kaesong.heard on 'morning edition':the reaction came amid rising tensions after an investigative report concluded that north korea was to blame for sinking a south korean naval vessel in march, killing 46 sailors.south korea on tuesday resumed propaganda broadcasts across the north-south border. the north has threatened to fire artillery shells at south korean loudspeakers used in the broadcasts. pyongyang also said it will resume its own broadcasts.reports also said the north had ordered its military on high alert and that south korean ships and aircraft would be prohibited from passing through its territory.restrictions on trade, travelin addition to taking its complaint against north korea to the u.n. security council, south korean president lee myung-bak said monday that his country would cut off much of its trade with the north.lee also said north korean merchant vessels will no longer be allowed to use a shortcut through south korean waters, a move that would force the north korean ships to expend more time and fuel.but analysts say the measures won't be enough to change the north's behavior.an international investigation found that the explosion of the south korean warship cheonan on march 26 was caused by a torpedo launched from a north korean submarine.north korea has denied any involvement in the sinking and said it would treat the south's retaliatory measures as an act of war.u.s. backs south, looks to u.n. actionthe united states has fully backed its ally south korea. secretary of state hillary clinton was in beijing tuesday seeking support from china on u.n. security council action against north korea. she was headed later tuesday for meetings wednesday in seoul.the united states maintains a deterrent force of about 28,500 troops in south korea, a military legacy from the 1950-53 korean war, which ended with an uneasy armistice.analysts say the real danger amid the current tensions may come if north korean ships decide to test the south korean blockade, running the risk of provoking another conflict at sea. in what may be an effort to warn the north koreans away from such a confrontation, the pentagon has said the u.s. navy would join south korea's navy in anti-submarine-warfare exercises in the near future.given north korea's bellicose statements so far, it's not clear how its military would react in a confrontation at sea.i think everybody's trying to get the mix just right, says thomas hubbard, a former u.s. ambassador to south korea. to have measures that are strong enough to teach a lesson, but not so strong as to create a retaliatory cycle.will sanctions hurt north korea?north korea exports minerals, such as construction sand, and some farm products to the south. the loss of that trade could amount to more than $250 million a year. that's relatively tiny by the standards of most industrial countries, but because the north is so impoverished, experts say the loss will be felt.enlargejung yeon-je/afp/getty imagesa south korean protester burns a north korean flag with an image of north korean leader kim jong il during a rally in seoul on tuesday. south korea has imposed trade sanctions on the north for alleged sinking a southern naval vessel.that's enough to have an impact on north korea's economy, says analyst jack pritchard, but it won't be a decisive impact. even so, pritchard, the president of the korea economic institute in washington, says the sanctions are a necessary step to express south korean anger over the attack.pritchard says the south's action leaves north korea in a weaker position, with little trade beyond what it has with its major trading partner, china.north korea's trade with the south was a source of foreign exchange currency, which the north then used to buy items such as fuel and machinery from china, commodities that are especially important to the north's large military.but the trade situation between the north and south has been deteriorating over the more than two years that lee has been in office, says charles armstrong, director of the center for korean studies at columbia university.a former executive at hyundai corp., lee is a conservative politician who has taken a tougher line on north korea than several of his predecessors. trade between the two countries fell by an estimated 10 percent last year.china steps inarmstrong notes that china already has wide investments in north korea, and he says it will probably take up much of the slack caused by the south korean trade cutoff. both china and south korea view the north as an important source of low-cost labor.one major exception to the trade cutoff is the kaesong industrial complex, an area in north korea where more than a dozen south korean companies have built or are building manufacturing plants to be staffed by north korean workers.activity at the kaesong complex amounts to more than half the trade between the two countries.it's already a significant source of income for the north, where workers are believed to earn a total of more than $40 million a year in hard currency wages. south korean economists believe it could eventually employ more than 700,000 north korean workers.hubbard says south korea would be reluctant to shut the project down. more than trade, [the south koreans] see this as laying the basis for future relations, hubbard says.he adds that if the kaesong complex were shut down, the loss of jobs would very likely stir a strong public reaction that even the north korean leadership would have to pay attention to.one thing that's not clear to economists is how much criminal activity contributes to north korea's economy.according to the u.s. state department, north korea is also thought to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the unreported sale of missiles, narcotics and counterfeit cigarettes and currency.

2972,i am 21 years old and i am doing the hcg diet for the second time. i did it last year and lost almost 40 lbs. i was very unhealthy and almost diabetic so i had to do something, i haven't gained any weight back. i've been overweight my entire life, most of my weight is on my tummy. i am still overweight. i'm at 217 now and i want to lose 80 lbs this year. i am doing the hcg injections again and it's my 4th day and i'm having a really hard time! 500 calories a day is so hard. before when i did this diet i didn't have a job where i needed to be up at 6:30 5 days a week and be on my feet for 8 hours a day. how can i stay on track and stick to this? :( also, i need some good recipes! i am already tired of chicken and apples. any advice on the hcg diet? anyone? please? and thank you!
2973,hi, i have been given 4 supplements by my integrative pain med doctor for energy and muscle pain. i was asked to take up to 1000mg of coenzyme q10, 100mg twice a day of a b1,b6, and malate, twice a day corvalin (d-ribose) and 1000mg twice a day of carnitine. i was able to get up to 800 mg of coenzyme q10, the twice daily dose of d-ribose, and 200mg of the b1,b6, malate combo. i was on each of these for about at least 4 days and then i got the carnitine in and took 500mg in the morning. i felt really tired all day, and felt short of breath.i just though perhaps i was overtired that day so i took the second pill of 500mg of carnitine in the evening and at bedtime i felt more short of breath and i then felt my pulse and it was beating two time then skip a beat, then two times then skip a beat and so on. i got worried and told my husband . we decided to wait a bit and about a hour or two later my heart beat started to go back to normal. i have had a 12 lead ekg recently and it was normal (before the supplements) and he said my heart sounded very strong. so, i went down by half on everything and stopped the carnitine. my doctor agreed. but i was wondering if any of you have had a bad reaction like this? carnitine is supposed to be good for the heart as is coenzyme q10. so, i don't know why but my body sure didn't like it. any other comments. i am now on 100mg of the b6 as i worried about getting neuropathy at a higher dose and it does help my muscle pain a bit, along with the magnesium i already take.thanks in advance,mkh9
2974,i tried to post this question under the pregnancy forum, but received an error message saying it was full. so, i am posting it here.i am a 25 year old college student who has only been sexually active for about 8 months (have been a virgin before that). i have been taking oral contraceptives due to the fact that i have endometriosis, and have had it for several years. now that i'm sexually active, the pills are a big plus. my boyfriend and i have been using condoms as well as the pill since day one. we are both very serious students and know that a child right now would not be the best for us. we do plan on marrying after school.anyway, last night we had a condom breakage situation and we are both a bit frantic now. with my cycles i have been instructed by my doctor to take the pills for 3 months straight without pausing for a cycle (skipping the pink sugar pills). according to my pills, i should be on about the 4 or 5th day of my period, but am taking taking the white pills and skipping it. not sure if i am ovulating right now due to the strange cycle schedule my doctor has me on.i also took the first of the two morning after pills last night and will take the next in a couple of hours. does any one know what the liklihood of me being pregnant is? should i take a preg test in a week or so? i'm so new to this, i feel really lost. please help.

2980,the above hcg shot.    i read in one of my posts that this was available at cvs.    did they have to special order it.     does anyone know if they can get this at costco.     i paid a lot at the apothecary (sp?) shop.     i was told this is the only place i cuold buy the fertility meds in phx.     i swear those pharmaceutical companies rip people off.    they hike up their drugs so much.     very annoying

2982,i understand there is some concern about further government regulations in general. i myself would tend to believe that when schools overstep the boundaries of parents and take action against students that is not just discipline but potential physical abuse that should be outlawed but people might have their own concerns. this site appears in support of it and it is from the republican legislature:http://www.gop.gov/bill/111/1/hr4247this is the text of the bill itself:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-4247since some people may have children who could be affected or know people who are i thought i would post this and people could decide what their opinion is.
2983,recently i took a few pregnancy tests and all came out positive. i have endometriosis and was told by my doc i probably wouldn't be able to get pregnant. so im still in shock. what are the risks of being pregnant and having endometriosis? also, i smoked cigarettes til i found out i was pregnant a few days ago. im almost 7 wks along. is my baby going to be okay even though i smoked through the first 6 weeks?
2984,i had some bleeding so i went to the er to get it checked out. i had an u/s and it said i was 5 weeks and 3 days on sunday. according to my calander i would have been 6 weeks one day . i went to have another u/s that thursday and it showed that i was 5 weeks 3 days. the doctor said he saw a sac, and it looked like it could be two sacs but i would have to have another u/s next week. does this mean that the baby has stopped growing or could the u/s been read wrong. has anyone had any experiences like this? i'm definitely trying to be very positive and hopeful, but its very hard.
2985,my husband has naion. for several years, we have gone to the university of iowa eye clinics for yearly check-ups.    his doctor there has left, and i am wondering if there is a kansas city doctor who is experienced in this rare condition. he currently has a medical condition requiring surgery, and his treating physician must consult with someone familiar with naion and his records.    can you help?

2992,hi, im very paranoid but yesterday my gf was giving me a handjob and i never came but we were in a hot tub. im worried about pre *** as you cant feel it come out and although i never felt any penetration if she is wearing a bikini that wasn  t taken off or anything. but then my penis was out in the open and i brought her closer to me but nothing on her side was taken off. i never actually came but im worried if i had precum and my penis accidentally made her bikini down there move so it went under and touched her vagina. is this even possible to get her pregnant if something like this happened and nothing was removed on her part? please i have been worrying about this all night and day! thankyou
2993,hi,my wife and i just had our first child on july 4th. she had a c-section. a day after she began to have a fever. it would go up and down with the anti-biotics. finally it broke and she had a normal temperature for the 24 hours required by her doctor and we were sent home. now this morning, she began a fever again. it hit 101.9 and we called her doc. basically all that was done is she was given some anti biotics. i gave her the first dose earlier. the fever began to break and was fine for awhile. now it has hit 100.9. the doctor said she may have an infection somewhere. she has been drinking cold water only, resting, and eating good fresh foods. does anyone know anything else that can help here overcome this quicker? i am just worried about her :).thanks,jason

2996,hi all, i was wondering if you could help me! i had uti not long ago and i started to take anbiotics for it. it seems like the antibiotics brought in yeast infection too (my doctor said after the swab test) so my doctor put me on clomazol. i had no itchiness, burning or any weird discharge but started to use the treatment. after couple of days, i started to have some clumpy discharge (which i never had before) so i continued to use the treatment. i have now finished the treatment but i occasionally have some clumpu discharge.... does this mean that i still have yeast infection? or is it a residual of the infection? please help!!!!!

2998,hi... i had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the 2nd of december. he definitely pulled out, but seeing as that's not the most effetive method, i took plan b on the 4th (about 40 hours later). anyway, i started brown spotting on the afternoon of the 8th. about 8 hours later, it picked up into a full flow. i thought this was an early period but it only lasted for 2 days. (my periods usually last about 4). anyway, i'm now 2-3 days late. what should i be thinking at this point? thanks..

3000,i was diagnosed with herpes about 2 1/2 years ago. haven't had an outbreak since the inital (which was in the anal area).i did a really stupid thing and had drunken unprotected sex with a new boyfriend (he is aware of the herpes, and we've always used condoms before). please don't lecture me on the unprotected sex - i know how stupid i was.i thought i was having another outbreak because i started to develop some itching in my genital area and it was red and swollen on of the outer lips. i also saw kind of a dark red circular area in between my inner and outer lips. i started taking my valtrex yesterday (2 pills for 3 days).this evening i got home from work and my genitals look horrible. one of my inner lips is so swollen - pretty much doubled in size from the other. plus part of the lips, the part closest to my vaginal opening, feels kind of crusty. the space where before i saw the dark red area is still red..but there is some ***** looking stuff in the crease (looks like yellow discharge, just a little not a lot). and i'm not having a lot of discharge, but a little of it in the bottom part of the vaginal opening, looks yellow. i am also pretty raw.my boyfriend says he doesn't have anything but i didn't insist on a test so i know that doesn't mean anything. having not experienced an outbreak in this area i don't know if this is normal or if i have contacted something else.please help me if you recognize these symptoms!!

3012,i am 10 weeks pregnant at about 6 weeks i started spotting at first it was brown.now it is bright red and fills a pad then i stop and go back to spotting. i have had 2 ultrasound to confirm the baby has a heart beat.i have had 3 pregnancys and 3 live births.i know there is something not right but when doctors are telling you not to worry that is what bothers me i am afraid to let my guard down and not worry that its a misscarriage only because if it turns out to be one i dont think i can handle that.i have went to 2 hospitals for different opions on this but they all say the same thing that if it is a miscarriage there is nothing they can do in whick i do understand that but what if there is something that can be controlled. i am so annoyed with that fact that no one    cares i think that that is rediculous because my baby has a heartbeat!

3016,hi all, amazing & inspiring site & response.    i can feel the comfort of support from this site.    i just wanted to share with you all that i am trying my 1st iui treatment.    they are currently analyzing all the hormones, my fiance's blood, urine as well sperm.    he's had several tests prior to meeting with fertility clinic. they just wanted to make sure they knew how much they had to work with.    i love this fertility clinic.    we only pay if they complete proceedure.    if they find for it to be a non satisfactory cycle for either, they will not go ahead with iui that month, they will wait for the next. nice to have some honest ppl around for change.    no guarentees this we know of, as we've heared some get lucky the first time, other takes several attempts, and other does not work for them at all.    our fertility is still unexplained so far.    tubes are wide open, well left side is, cause caused it to spaz when i had tubes check with blue dye proceedure.any advice ladies or gentlemen, before proceeding witih iui?    we've been trying for over 1.1/2 yrs now with no success naturally.    i did have a thyroid issue, wich is now regulated by hormone pills, that are taken daily, maybe that had a definate effect on why we've been unsuccessful.    we've tried 3 rounds of clomid, very basic dose 50mg, however i'm told the higher you go the more chances of multiples. i'll be happy with one, however two would definately make a new spin on things. i'm a mother of 1.    i had her 11 yrs ago.    i know quite the age gap, however she's not my fiance's.    in fact my fiance for him would be his first.    i want so badly to make him a father, he's looking forward to being a father soon.anything we can do to help the proceedure? both he or i?    any advice is definitely appreciated & welcome.    we are newbies to this iui process.my fiance is 33, i'm 32.both healthy, no other complications or illness.my daughter was born very healthy, a bit smaller however that was due to toxemia & being 2 weeks early.oh, anyone know what the chances are of another c-section if first was one?or can i have a normal birth with taring?   baby dust to you... manny
3017,hi ihad frozen 2 5day embrios transfer 1/6/2010 1st hcg    on 1/18/2010 was 157, second 1/25/10 was 1304 i had transvaginal sonogram and no sac was detected i had to go back    on 1/27/10    md saw sac ,but no hb and my hcg level only went up to1534 . any one can give me hope? thank you! slavi70
3018,i had a growth on my tonsils and my doctor said it was a papiloma. it was removed and cauterized. he doesnt know that i smoke and said my only limitations were to stay away from citrus and spicy foods. does anyone think it would effect anything if i smoke ?
3019,i want to re-enlist in the army. the problem is that upon my discharge in 2006 i had some emotional problems. i was diagnosed with ptsd by the va and am receiving    30% disablilty payments monthly. i'm going back to the therapists to inform them that i feel fine and have not had any adverse symptoms (trouble sleeping, aggressiveness, replays, deep depression, etc) in about a year. i want to cease the disability payments that i feel i no longer am entitled to. will the fact that i was at one time receiving disablility payments for ptsd exclude me from re-enlisting.
3020,my breasts, esp nipples are really tender. i know it's because my sex life has ramped up. (from the release of oxytocin w orgasm, i'm guessing)    i have major fibrocystic tissue in my breasts. don't know if this is contributing or not.how can i get relief without avoiding sex?
3021,i have braces on my teeth and have metal bands around 4 of my molars (1 in each quadrant) where the braces attach. on the two bottom molars, the teeth look kind of greyish instead of white. they sometimes hurt when i'm eating, but i don't know if that's just because they are moving with the braces etc. i don't see any holes in the top of the teeth, but with the band around them i can't see the sides of them to check for any holes. does it sound like i have cavities in these teeth? maybe a hole underneath the metal bands has let decay get into the teeth or something and that's why they don't look white anymore?
3022,could you please tell me the dental word that means there's a space for a missing tooth.    it sounds something like apoxic or apothic - example - 6 unit bridge with teeth 9 & 10 apoxic.
3023,i    had sex many times before. i never bled not once, not even my first time.i recently had sex with my new boyfriend and bled so nuch. im really scared,i dont know whats happening
3024,does tylenol worsen asthma for kids?npr 20 feb 2012http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/02/20/147002356/does-tylenol-worsen-asthma-for-kidsparents and doctors around the world have been alarmed by the dramatic increase in childhood asthma.one factor in the upswing is better detection by doctors, but at least one doctor thinks a common over-the-counter drug also has something to do with it.dr. john mcbride sees lots of kids with asthma. he's a pediatric pulmonologist at akron children's hospital in ohio. he knew of studies that raised concern about the safety of acetaminophen    brand name tylenol    to treat colds and fever in kids with asthma. so he decided to look more closely at the research.i was stunned, he says. all the studies he looked at showed a link between asthma and acetaminophen.the more acetaminophen somebody takes, the more likely it is that they have asthma, he says. also, there's an incredible consistency. everybody around the world who's looked for this association has been able to find it.in asthma, the airways of the lungs get blocked by mucous and narrow. that leads to wheezing and shortness of breath. the rise in asthma has closely paralleled the increased use of acetaminophen.there are no scientific studies proving the medication causes asthma, but mcbride says it may make asthma worse in kids who already have it.nine-month-old martez coughs and wheezes as mcbride examines him and talks with his mom, ceasha moorer, about his asthma. he coughs. he wheezes. there are multiple symptoms, she says. he works very hard to breathe. when he's excited from crawling or even laughing, then he breathes really hard.in the past when martez got a cold, moorer gave him tylenol. but that seemed to make his symptoms worse. at mcbride's suggestion, she stopped using it. then one day, her aunt was looking after martez when he had a cold.i told her don't give him tylenol, moorer says. i didn't specify that it was acetaminophen. she actually gave him a cold medicine, but it seemed to make him kind of worse. i looked at the active ingredients and acetaminophen was in the active ingredients.in fact, acetaminophen is an ingredient in many cough and cold products    including nyquil, robitussin and theraflu. it might exacerbate the asthma because it decreases levels of a molecule called glutathione, which protects the lungs.so removing the beneficial effect of glutathione exactly at a time children's lungs are being irritated might end up being just one factor that contributes to the onset of an asthma attack, mcbride says.mcbride's recommendation? don't give acetaminophen to a child who has asthma. other doctors say it's too soon for that advice.many other factors could play a role in the rise of asthma, according to dr. stanley szefler, head of pediatric pharmacology at national jewish health in denver. vitamin d insufficiency, dietary changes, air pollution or better control of infections are perhaps all related to the increasing prevalence of asthma, he says.johnson & johnson, maker of tylenol, said in a statement that the medicine has been used safely and effectively for more than 50 years. there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies that show a causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, and asthma, the company said.it's important to control a child's fever, szefler says. mcbride agrees but says ibuprofen is a safer bet    at least until ongoing studies provide answers about the safety of acetaminophen for kids with asthma.
3025,so im just wondering how much blood id too much. af was 6 days late, but that was to be expected since ive had lots of trouble in the past 2 months anyway. but its way heavier than ever before. dr always said fill up 1 pad an hour is too much but i dont use pads i dont have any either, im using regular absorbency tampons and a pantyliner and within 1.5 hours they were both soaked, i could feel the blood coming out even with the tampon in. ive never bled this much before, but im wondering if maybe this could be normal since i was 6 days late. and last month my period was 11 days and very very minimal, just kinda like watery spotting. i dont feel weak or fatigued or anything either.
3026,i am 16 years old.    over the past few weeks i have noticed a lump that is right near my pubic bone.    it has grown into the size of a small marble.    i asked my mom about it and she said that all it was is something ingrown that is probably filled with some type of liquid.    it is becoming more painful and i think it might be something serious.    please, i need help.
3027,hi! we've just got our first baby's first doppler ultrasound at 7 weeks of pregnancy. the doctor said the baby has a good heart beat and the size is fine for the gestational age. however, she told me we have an irregular shaped gestational sac that might cause some risk to the child. said pregnant women usually have a spherical sac, and mine isn't. any mom here who have had the same experience as mine. might go back for another ultrasound after a week to see if there has been any changes with the shape. help, moms! help!
3028,is there any way that you can increase your milk supply? my milk never seemed to come in. my baby still seems hungry after breastfeeding, and even with pumping i can only get about 2 ounces from each breast.
3029,i have been reading a lot of the posts recently and learning a lot. i was hoping that someone could answer a question for me. i haven't been charting my temps. but i have been taking my temps here and there. i noticed that my temp is up today compared to last week. this week was suppose to be my fertile week. are high temps associated with ovulation only or are temps high when you become pregnant, how does that all work? thank you for any light that you can shed on this topic for me.....
3030,i have been taking fertiaid for one month and a half. i notice that i have become more moist. however my period never came. now i'am on my second month and i have ovulated again. i'm very confused now with my cycle. i have been having normal 32 day cycle for the past 2 months before i started taking fertiaid. have anyone experience this from taking fertiaid. i have been ttc for 2 month now. this is my 3rd month ttc. hopefully it works.
3031,hello i am 7 weeks. and two days ago i started bleeding a little more than just spotting and it only lasted for a half a day with no cramping. i have no symptoms, so i am worried that i miscarried? any input would be great to ease my mind. thanks
3032,hi i am a 31 year old female and i have been married for 11 years. the problem i seem to be facing is that i constantly am wanting and desiring any form of sex. i fantasize almost on a continuous basis about having sex with whoever is around at the moment. i enjoy masturbating while having phone sex, with anyone willing. none of this involves my husband. i've had 2 affairs and struggle all the time to keep my feelings in check. i do not want to hurt my husband, but love the attention that i get from guys and find myself flirting and teasing them sexually. i love sex and struggle with boredom when it comes to my husband. somebody please help me i feel like a freak.
3033,well the brownish discharge was the beginning of my period,so do i count the discharge day as one or the red blood day as one???and the ovalation kit when do i test with that during my period or after?
3034,i' m very curios to know that why the women get very fertile after a mc? and how long would it last....is it like the next three/four cycles would be very fertile window?is this also true for a d&c?a few weeks ago ,my 11wks baby had stopped developing at week8 which means i had a missed mc which couldn't start its own....two days later ,it started its own and lasted about two days..since i was scheduled for d&c,i had that too to clean up the left overs etc....so from the recovery perspective,should i wait 2-3 cycle before ttcing again since i had a d&c, or should i wait only 1-2 cycles considering that i had a natural mc?thnx
3035,will i get my period if i stop pill 10 days before i would normally expect my period? any bleeding caused by stopping mini pill suddenly?
3036,hi everyone i'm new here and i'm a bit worried!basically last month i began to feel sore down there. i checked myself out and found a small cyst on my clitoris. i went the doctors and they drained it for me and gave me antibiotics which cleared it right up.now, a month on i have begun to feel sore again :( the pain began early this morning, again on my clitoris. i checked where the pain was but couldn't see a cyst. i got myself over the doctors today and the nurse said there's nothing there but it is very red and sore. she's given me antibiotics again so i'm going to have to see how i go and hope to god i don't find a cyst there tomorrow.i should add that both times this has flared up, i've been due on my period. i'm not sexually active so it can't be that.i had a bartholin's cyst, or an abscess earlier this year which i had to go to hospital for. i wonder if that has been the trigger for all this, although that was a lot more painful.i was just wondering if anybody has experienced the same and if anybody knows the cause and how to prevent it in future?! i can't be putting up with this every month and i have a new job to start on monday :(my doctor said he's going to refer me to a gynaecologist next week.anybody else had this problem?

3040,chicago (cbs)    the president of the south suburban branch of the naacp alleges a director of the re-election campaign of barack obama has threatened and intimidated him because he doesn  t support the president.david lowery says he believes he was threatened during a phone conversation with louis raymond, the illinois political director for obama for america.lowery says he doesn  t personally support the president because he  s not addressing issues important to the black community. he said he was explaining that to raymond when the obama campaign official told him,   you know what? i know everything about you.  lowery says raymond added,   we  ve been watching you, and since you don  t support obama, we  ll deal with you,   before hanging up.lowery filed a report with the oak forest police report, he says,   in case something happens.  he says it was suggested the naacp should automatically back the president. lowery notes a non-profit cannot support a particular candidate.he says it  s a clear signal the obama campaign is concerned about the black vote.lowery hosts an internet radio program called   let the truth be told,   where he  s made no secret of his displeasure with the president.louis raymond declined to comment. the obama re-election campaign issued a written statement in response to lowery  s claims.  unfortunately there seems to have been a miscommunication regarding this conversation and we have since discussed with the campaign staffer in an effort to clarify the matter. the president continues to support the mission and principles of the naacp and the work they do,   the statement said.lowery says he  s not for romney, either.http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/10/04/naacp-official-obama-campaign-staffer-threatened-me/

3043,i have copd. i got a cold and it was on it's way to turning into pneumonia. i went to the doctor. i was given some kind of antibiotic shot in the butt, and then sent home with three doses (days) of azithromycin (500 mg per dose). i was also put on blood pressure medication for the first time. it is lisinopril, 10 mg in the morning and evening. other than this i take spiriva once a day and use albuterol by nebulizer. i also take many supplements every day.i was fine yesterday after going to the doctor, in fact felt like a new person shortly after and i am assuming this is due to that shot they gave me. i felt great this morning when i went back to the doctor for a short re-check. i have another appointment for next monday.the problem began after i got home from my appointment, i'd say around 2 p.m. suddenly i have diarrhea. it's not that i have to run to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but seems to be simply that i had a bowel movement and it was basically brown water. i had a very normal bowel movement last evening. then i started noticing last evening that when i had to go to the bathroom, not much was coming. and today it's worse. at this point there is no pain, and not even a lot of discomfort. but i do feel i have to go and when i attempt to only a few trickles, or nothing comes.could this be from that antibiotic shot they gave me, or could it be from the azithromycin or lisinopril, or a combination? i'm a bit frightened and not sure what to you. i live in a small rural town with a clinic. the doctor i seen will not be back here now until next monday.i would appreciate some input on this, please.
3044,i remember having all sorts of odd dreams when i was pregnant (so many years ago!).what kinds of dreams are you having?     funny?    scary?     do you think any have meaning, or are they just randomly strange dreams?i remember both times, dreaming i had the baby, and it came out looking exactly like a barbie doll--complete with plastic breasts and clothes.very strange.
3045,hi everyone,as i have researched success stories about taking clomid, i have learned that most woman that become pregnant off of using clomid, have had specific reasons for taking it. for example, someone with pcos who takes clomid, typically will conceive, since the clomid is fixing the problem.in my situation, i believe i had a short luteal phase, periods 24 to 26 days apart, therefore, after my doctor ran the tube test on me and my tubes are good and then he tested my boyfriends sperm and his lil swimmers are good, well, he put me on clomid. he never did any tests regarding my ovulation before the clomid, i am now on my second cycle of clomid. i am wondering if he automatically assumed that my problem was the short luteal phase. i have read that a short luteal phase could prevent implantation and that i very well may have conceived before but it could have passed through my cycles.i guess i am just wondering if the clomid will help me if a short luteal phase is my problem? does anyone have any feedback? please help!! i would love to hear anyone's success stories behind clomid fixing their short luteal phase and actually conceiving. i really appreciate it in advance!!

3049,hello all,i am 23 year old and am not sexually active. in fact, i have never had sex yet due to cultural thing. in our tradition girls are not supposed to have sex before marriage, and i am not married so i'm virgin.my problem is severe pain i face everytime my menstrual period starts. it only last the first day of my period and continues about 5-7 hours. i have long pain in low abdominal part, on the line of underwear where the womens' eggs are located. sometimes i have pain on the right side and at other times i have pain on the left side. usually the pain accompanies the pain in my back part of the same spot (a bit upper my butt).almost everytime, on the first day of my period when i am suffering the pain in bed i also start vomitting. so i pretty much try to eat nothing on that day.does anyone has a similar thing? what did you do in your case? please share with your suggestions! i would really appreciate it!i've been seen by a doctor in an er about a year ago, he did the ulstrasound and cat scan but said i am fine. then, when he was about to do the gyn test with some instrument i didn't allow as i explained that i can't lose my virginity. losing virinity means not being able to get married later (cultural thing).please, please advise!thanks a lot in advance!

3052,hi my son is 14. he has been on prozac 20mg for over a yr. he mentioned about 3 wks ago that he was hearing a voice but could not tell me what it said. a few days ago he told me this again. he said the voice sounds like a demon and it is telling him to hurt himself and others. i took him to a mental health er on wed. he saw a nurse, a therrapist and a psychiatrist. the psychiatrist upped his prozac to 40mg. he also said that males at this age who have depression symptoms sometimes experience this. he started the 40mg prozac on thurs. morning and says the voices are more frequent. does any one have any suggestions or know how long we should wait for the prozac to work. he has an appointment with a therapist on wed.
3053,sept. 2nd, silicone oil was removed after macular hole surgery.    on sept. 15th i stopped all eye drops, tapering off of the cortisone for 4 days. sept. 17th noticed hundreds of tiny floating specs.    being afraid of a retinal tears, i returned and had a comple eye exam.    my group of opthalmologists are noted as being some of the best. two days later, another recheck exam with another opthalmooigist (my primary is on vaction.) the conclusion that i stopped the cotisone drop too soon, without properly tapering off and these specs are inflamatory cells., or pigment cells.    i began to taper off at 4 drops a day for a week, now 3 for a week, now 2 for a week.    oct. 6, the specs are still present in abundance.    there is no change.    i have another appointment in two weeks.    is it possible that a retinal tear can be so small as to produce symptoms and yet go undetecked in an exam?    have anyone ever heard of this phenomenon.thank you.

3061,i have been taking 500mgs of l-tyrosine first thing in the morning, along with 500mg b12 and dhea 5mg. just wondering if i'm getting as much as needed or not enough. i'm needing the energy boost in the morning.mornings are still pretty tough and i'm still drinking 2 cups of coffee, and still taking a little dive mid morning. i thought the energy may last pretty much all day! thanks everyone!
3062,im 17 years old and my periods are for the most part regular they only last about 4-5 days, but i've noticed when im changing my tampons there is usually a dark red blod clot. its not huge but its a good size. i just recently started having sex with my boyfriend and i thought that might be the reason but this was happening before we became sexually active. i was worried about tss maybe, but i really dont show any of the symptoms. what could be causing this? is it normal?
3063,i havent had a period since the 1st of july but then i was bleeding for 3 weeksthen i got the injection on the 15th of july but now im spotting sometimes after sexbut the nurse did tell me that i should start my period a few days afer the injection,but i didnt,and i done 2 pregnancy test and both were negative....
3064,i just gave birth to my second child 2 months ago (my first is 14 months) and i have been diagnosed with thyroiditis (they think it is post partum thyroiditis i am going for testing) and i also had a pancreatitis attack shortly after giving birth to my son a year ago, and one after the birth of my daughter a few weeks ago. could the pancreatitis be post partum also? i dont drink a ton. i am 27 so it isnt like it has been years of alcohol abuse ...i haves drank in years (because i was pregnant) and before that was a bartender so would have a few drinks after work but not excessivly drink.
3065,jaidyn is now 15 months old and can crawl on his hands and knees, sit up on his own and can pull up on furniture or our legs to stand. he cannot remain standing if he lets go, and cannot walk. he does have a baby walker (like adults use, only cuter, with toys etc.) he loves it because he can walk behind it without falling. if you watch him from behind when he walks you can see that he walks on the sides of his feet. the physical therapy people say its because his ankles are weak. (my oldest son was born with clubfeet so my daughter thinks it is probably an inherited family issue.) his pediatrician and his early intervention people have never said anything about the shape of his feet, they only say his ankle muscles are weak. it seems to me that if his feet were misshapen they would have noticed before now. having dealt with my son's clubfeet i don't see any resemblance, however i suppose it's possible. jaidyn still can't vocalize very well and only occasionally uses consonant sounds. the pt people are having them use sign language with him. why?
3066,my friend has been trying to become pregnant for over a year. she became pregnant back in december and lost the baby.    her cycles have never been normal there have been times she has skipped a month. do you have any helpful ideas?

3071,london (afp)    british foreign secretary william hague spoke out thursday against the medieval planned stoning to death for adultery of a woman in iran, saying it would disgust and appal the rest of the world.hague commented on the case of 43-year-old sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani. human rights group amnesty international has said she was convicted in 2006 or 2007 and has previously received a flogging of 99 lashes.i'm appalled by reports of the imminent execution, hague said at a press conference in london alongside turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu.i think that stoning is a medieval punishment that has no place in the modern world and the continued use of such a punishment in iran demonstrates in our view a blatant disregard for human rights.he added: i do call on iran to put an immediate stay to this execution and review the process by which this woman is tried and i think if this punishment were carried out, it would disgust and appal the watching world.davutoglu was asked whether turkey would raise the case with iran.we're trying to work and consult on all these issues with our neighbour iran, of course we have to see the file, he said.the case was also raised in britain's house of commons, prompting speaker john bercow to describe it as a horrific, truly horrific matter.we in this house, i hope, are in favour of human rights, not of their grotesque abuse, he added.amnesty has called on the iranian authorities to halt all executions and commute all death sentences.it says that sakineh mohammadi-ashtiani, who has two children, could be at imminent risk of execution.it is highlighting her case alongside that of kurdish political activist zeynab jalalian, who was sentenced to death last year.
3072,i have recently had two urine drug screens come back showing trace amounts of oxycodone.    i have not taken this drug.    i suffer from severe chronic pain in my back and have been prescribed dilaudid for almost 3 years, which i take regularly on a daily basis and without it i am totally bedridden.    i recently changed doctors and as part of a provincial program for regular use of controlled narcotics, i have to submit to random drug screens to prove i do not use illicit (street) drugs or any medications that are not prescribed to me and that patients who are prescribed narcotics are not selling them and not taking them.    i am absolutely fine with this program and confident submitting to the testing because i take my prescribed medication regularly and have absolutely nothing to hide.    i have submitted two samples of urine on two different occasions 6-8 weeks apart and both results came back showing my dilaudid but also showing *trace* amounts of oxycodone in my urine sample.    why could this be happening to me?    it is threatening my treatment and making me look dishonest to my new doctor, as people who do use drugs they are not prescribed and street drugs always say they didnt' use them when their results come back positive.    of course, i am telling him this as well and he is saying every patient he has will deny they didn'[t do the drug when their screen comes back positive, just like i am saying to him!!    i need to know what i can suggest as testing to prove it is something in my system causing this false-positive result and also an explaination for him why it is showing trace amounts of oxycodone when i have not taken any of this drug.    medically, i usually have protein in my urine on testing in small amounts from kidney damage years ago and have rheumatoid arthritis.    i have no other medical conditions that i know of, which is also a concern, as i am worried because i have read so much online that this test result may mean something is awry in my system and showing up in a different way....(eg: diabetes, kidney failure etc).    can someone with expertise in the lab testing area please help me bring some information forward to my doctor in terms of what i should be tested for as i may have a rare molecule in my urine etc........this is threatening my treatment with my regularly prescribed medication and i have to prove i am not taking any oxycodone and not lying about it.    please help if you know anything i can research or suggest to him that we test for.
3073,at 12 weeks and 6 days i started to bleed heavily but no pain.    i had to rush to the hospital because the amount of blood i lost was abnormal.    after having been checked by 2 doctors and after having 4 ultrasounds we found out that i have blood clots on the wall of my uterus.    we heard the baby's heart beat and everything was ok.    the only problem was that the blood clots were taking up 50% of space on the uterus.    they told me that i haven't done anything to cause this and that it is mother nature.    things like this can happen.    so they told me that i have to be a couch potato.    no straining, no abrupt movements, no lifting.    i had to go back 2 weeks later for another ultrasound.    the blood clots are down to 10%.    they were very happy.    i am still bleeding but it is brown.    they told me that that is old blood.    my doctor even said that i might bleed throughout my entire pregnancy.    now i am 15 weeks and 6 days and i am still on bed rest.    i have to go for ultrasouns every 2 weeks.anyone else in the same situation?
3074,me and my partner have been together for 6 six months. i was tested for sti before we started sleeping together unprotected and was given the all clear appart from a bacterial infection that was treated.when we have sex he gets red saws on his penis. he says that they are very painful for day or 2 and form scabs could this be from friction during sex? or should i get tested again? or could it be something to do with bacterial infection.
3075,ok, so i just got done ovulating yesturday, and today on and off all day, i have had these weird cramps just above my pubic bone. i have never experienced this before, and they felt a little bit like af cramps, but not as painful, just kind of annoying. we are ttc and i was just wondering if this could be a good sign. has anyone experienced this and turned out preggers? thanks for taking the time to read this! thanks!

3079,well we found out on monday that my beautiful wife is not pregnant after our 2nd ivf attempt.    it was especially hard since her birthday is the 4th of july..was hoping for a really great birthday present.    so now we are on to round 3 next month.    we have a phone consult with the re next week...any good questions i could ask him?    again, 8 iui's (one with pregnancy but miscarriage) and now 2 ivfs (icsi with hatching)..something's gotta be out of whack!?    right??i just need some advice on what we should be asking/questioning.do you think they should/will follow the same protocol?i consider myself very well versed on infertility with my medical background but now i'm sorta at a loss.help needed :)
3080,i had retinal detachment (ppv with gas bubble) surgery in my right eye almost 3 mons ago.    it took a while..over 2 mons before the blood in my eye started going away.    2 weeks ago, my doc found a small retinal tear in my right eye in which he lasered.    he said i now have new blood in the same eye because of the retinal tear.i now have a patch (looks like the map of texas) of blood (i hope it is) blocking my vision in the same operated eye.    it seems to be getting smaller very very slowly.    the edges of the patch seems thinner and i can still see blood/dust/black dots floating/swimming in my eye.    my vision around the patch cleared up a lot since my surgery after almost three months ago.    i can read and see around the patch.    but i think i already started seeing this patch 2 months after my surgery.    however, the doctor didnt see the retinal tear until the blood started subsiding 2 months after my surgery.1) is it still really blood still blocking my vision on the operated eye?    it is in the same spot in my eye?    im just nervous because it is taking a while to subside.    ive researched a lot on this webside and because of all the readings ive done im thinking it could be worse or more than just blood.2) how long until blood could subside in your eye?thanks in advance for your response.    i appreciate it.
3081,i keep getting what seems like a blister on the lower part of the back of my mouth behind my wisdom teeth.    i can pop the small bister and then it simply returns a few days later.    it has been coming back for almost 4 months now.    it is not painful, but i want to understand what it is.i thought it could be contributed to me still having my wisdom teeth as the blister is just behind when my back tooth is.    my dentist dismissed this idea and said it sould go away on it'sown.    it hasn't.    i am hoping someone can shed some light on this topic.thank you,chantal
3082,i have had the depo shots for about two months now. this is my first time ever having it and i am having an irregular period . first when i got it my period didnt come and i was very happy. now i belive its been a week or two and its still here. first it was light bleeding now its getting a bit heavier. how long do you think it will be til it goes away. im tired of bleeding even though theirs no side effects and its not a huge amount.
3083,i don't know if this is a disease i may have cought, or been born with, and its starting to freak me out.    i'm going to turn ninteen soon, but since my eighteenth b-day, ive been having strange stuff happen: i've been getting strange sores on random parts of my body, on my hips, my chest, around my vaginal area and one appeared on my right buttock.    they are sensitive to the touch and very painful, they swell, weep a clear fluid and have a white puss that comes out when squeezed. they go away after a while, however, as soon as one heals, another appears. they also leave marks behind, some red and pink, and some purple with some scarring. i'm told by friends and colleagues that they are just sores created by stress and anxiety.do i have something i should worry about?
3084,hello,to date, i am 8 days late for my period.    my last period was on july 18th 2008, and the one before that was on july 17th 2008.    for the month of july, my boyfriend and i have hardly had sex.    carelessly, we didn't use condoms but he did safely pull out.    i'm usually a day or two late on my periods, but i've never been this late.    i took a pregnancy test first thing this morning, and it came out negative.    i'm pretty sure im not pregnant because i have no breast soreness, nauseau, etc. but i do feel bloated and irratable still.    is there still a chance i may be pregnant, or is it just a change in my menstrual cycle?

3088,kind of interesting.    my mother in law passed away a while back.    the other night, i cannot remember what kind of day i had, but when i went to bed, i clearly smelled cigarette smoke.    mom was a smoker, but nobody in the house smokes.... i don't think anyone in the neighborhood smokes for that matter, and besides that, we all live on 2 acre lots, so it would take someone smoking in the house or right outside the window to created that smell.also, the same night i kept seeing shadow figures.    quite a few of them, and not just in the house either.    at work, in the gym.    i'm not scared by them and don't pick up any bad energy or anything.    i really feel as if it is my mother in law stopping in, or perhaps my grandmother.oh well, that's all i have.    have a good one!
3089,i just took the canasten pessary an hour ago, and i have some discomfort, i had the urge to urinate, so went downstairs and i felt this hot air inside me, sounds weird i know, also when i wiped i noticed bright red blood, even though reading all the responses, is this normal, i am happy to have found this site, but still worried! i had intercourse with my partner (before inserting this pessary) and i never bled, but the pessary has! help! *worried*
3090,there is incidentally noted a hyperechoic area within the posterior thigh measuring 2.5 cm in length x 6 mm in length of uncertain etiology. this is within the musculator and may reflect a hematoma. this could reflect scar tissue. the appearance is not suggestive of a lymph node.overall appearance is benign. however, correlation and follow up are recommended as clinically appropriate.the above paragraph is what was on the report, i have no idea what it means. note that i have had a small lump in the back of my mid thigh for about 3 months now and no one seems to know what it is.. no color change no warmth to the area just a lump with pain and soreness, worsens when i walk or stand. what does all of    this mean??
3091,hi i have had bad lower abdominal cramping and was 1 1/2 wks late on my period. i went to the er cause i was hurting very bad. after a sono and transvag sono and a cat scan they said i have a folded uterus and a cyst and to see a gyno.    they also gave me meds for the pain. i am wondering what is usually done to fix this if anything.    i had a tubal ligation 5 1/2 yrs ago. the pain at times is the worst i have ever had please if possible help.
3092,what activities should highly myopic individuals avoid to reduce the risk of retinal attachment? is bike riding and weightlifting safe?
3093,i am 28 and have been exp. pain that started on the right side of my left breast about four months ago. i didn't injure it but i thought i might have so i have given it some time to heal. however, i had the flu over the fourth of july and was at a funeral and my breast/chest hurt very badly along with extreme dizziness and feeling like i didn't drink my v8 juice (you know where they walk sideways because they didn't have their v8). i felt like/sometimes still do, feel like i'm just going to topple over.    but i didn't have it checked. over the past four months, this pain has grown from that orginating spot, up, above my left breast, up through to my collar bone on top, over to my far left shoulder tip (to where the shoulder looks a little dislocated), and esp. hurts in my armpit/breast region. i also have had pain under my left breast, by where i think the rib cage ends. there is a protrusion there, like the bottom of my rib cage has a bit of bone that sticks out. that started about seven years ago. i had a np look at it and she felt it too. my right side is not like that. i have had problems wearing bras because of this. there was a mammogram and cat scan done back then, but everything was fine and the np said she didn't know what is was. i was young and have been living with that pain for a while and didn't insist on getting an answer.    it goes into my back shoulder blade, where it hurts to breathe lately. today, my current np ordered x-rays of my shoulder although i told her it felt like my glands were swollen. the x-rays were fine. has anybody had something similiar or maybe have an inkling of how i can approach figuring this out? i will do the mammogram and utlrasound the np has set up for me, but what if this shows nothing? it's like they tell you you waited to long to come to the doctor for pain relief but other times they tell you you came too soon. screwed if you do and screwed if you don't. i don't want to do anything crazy but this pain is limiting my life-i can pretty much only lay in bed because if i'm asleep then i won't have to deal with the terrible pain. any help would be greatly appreciated.
3094,hiplease can someone help. my daughter of 9 complained 3 days ago with sudden eye pain, and double vision. her right side of her face is also very swolen. my first toughts were mumps but she has no pain.i took her to the gp immediately who prescribed antibiotics, the next day i was not happy with her behaviour as she lifts her chin up to the right side when she walks and talks. she also act strange almost like she is not looking me in the eyes when i talk to her, she also seems very lethargic, and when she walks it looks like she is not moving her arms.i did take her to the pediatrician who could not find anything wrong with her, besides the swollen right side of her face, but he does not know her, and i know this is not the way she is suppose to act.i am so worried, can i demand a mri scan from the pediatrician? i am not sure where to go from hereplease please...i need advice
3095,i am 31 years old i have iron and folic acid deficient anemia, along with that i have extreme fatigue to the point i could sleep 15 or more hours continuosly, with that comes with the loss of sex drive. i have had a headache for 1 month it stopped hurting for about 4 hours after the er gave me an iv with torridol. i also have left upper abdominal burning and pain, i have not been able to function normally for about a month and have no idea what to do next. they have completed blood work and so far the only thing that came back was anemia. the er completed a ct scan of my head and they said it was normal, they have prescribed percocet to me for the head ache which is not helping by the way. i am not one of the people who like the feeling of being drugged i would prefer someone find out what is wrong and help fix me then drug me. does anyone have any idea what this may be?    i have not told my dr about the pain because when i went for all of the other symptoms i was not having that pain. my mother told me 2 days ago that her grandmother passed away from leukemia so that has me worried as well. about 6 years ago i had my gallbladder removed so im almost certain it is nothing to do with that.
3096,well everyone who has been following my story (i had m/c on 11/18 and got pregnt before 1st af sometime around 12/2)... i am so excited and relieved to share some positive news.     i now my grandfather is definetly looking over me right now because i cant stop smiling and crying happy tears today.    we got a bfp on 12/14 and decided to go away to visit our families for    the holidays instead of getting the hcg monitoring every two days.    on 12/30 the day after my grandfather passed we got our 1st hcg results in, which were 14492, progesterone 22.    we scheduled our us for wednesday this week but ended up r/s because we had my grandfathers funeral.today we had our 1st us and meeting with our dr since finding out.    right away, he told us he seen a hb!    the embroyo and sac measured to-date at 6w6d, edd- 8/26 and the hb- 137.    he said the hb should be between 110-140 and that 137 was a nice, strong one.    he actually gave us pictures and placed them in a card that all the office staff signed.    the nurses and techs were giving us many hugs and it suddenly felt real.    we go back on 1/22 for a 2nd us... i will continue to pray for our baby and everyone else who is ttc or who has already.

3105,well, you should be done with the et, but probably still at the hospital on bedrest.    i'm sure that everything went very well for you. congrats and lots of bedrest now!!i wanted to tell you about ohss.    here's a website i found with a neat chart to let you know symptoms and what to do.http://www.ivf.com/ohss.htmlthe website is not the clinic i used, but my clinic gave me a chart similar to this one.    basically, my clinic had me keep a log of my weight, morning and night weight, to ensure that i didn't gain 5# in one day (your nite wt to morning wt).    also, trying to keep salt intake down will help to keep from retaining the fluid as well.let me know if you need any more info.    i hope i didn't scare you by this, but i think it's good to know, in case you do start to experience the symptoms.    i could tell a difference 9 days after the transfer, i felt more bloated than before the er.    i called the office to talk to them about it on day 12 just to make sure that everything was fine.     and, like i said, the main thing is take it easy if you can, and stay hydrated.    those two things alone will help.good luck to you.....all the best...ssbd x 2    :)

3111,hello ladies,as you all know, i was scheduled for an induction friday am.    however, little miss decided to make her entrance thursday at 11:24 am.    i was very glad to go into labour naturally.i woke up at 3:45, just feeling off.    by 4:30 i was sure i was in labour so i woke my dh, called l & d and headed over.    by the time we got there the contractions were 4-5 minutes apart.once in l & d, the ob team checked in on me, because of the complications with my ds they and the peds team were on standby for when i actually delivered.    i refused an epi at first, but about an hour later, after a great, informative discussion with my nurse i decided to have one.    my main concern was having pain relief in place if i had complications again.    the epi did slow down my contractions, but my doc just decided to let it unfold, i guess a lot of docs will give pitocin when that happens.    when i was 9 cm she broke my water and i was ready to push.i pushed for a little over two hours.    at one point my epi needle came out so i was au natural for the actual delivery.    i was beginning to think i would have medical intervention again....my doc kept saying you are making progress, slow progress but let's try for another 10 minutes....    and just as they were entering the room, i pushed her out.    (did have a small episiotomy).    yeah for a family doc who stayed with me through out my labour and talked me through all the hard parts.the peds team whisked her away, pronounced her perfect and had her back in my arms in just a few moments.    she weighed 6lbs 10 oz.    she looks just like her big sister.my husband put her on my bare chest when she was about 20 minutes old and she literally crawled up and latched on to my breast.    the nurse told me that she had seen that on video, but had not seen it in person ever.    and it was a sign how easy nursing was going to be.    she is a nursing fiend.at about 1 hour, still in l & d i started to bleed.    they tried uterine massage and then gave me hemobate which did stop the bleeding.    i was very glad as i knew the next step was the or.she has some jaundice, she was under the lights for abotu 8 hours.    that seems to be clearing up now, she is nice and alert, nursing well and we feel so very blessed.thank you to all my cyber sisters who comforted me when i miscarried, gave me great advice and rejoiced with me when i got that bfp.pictures are on my facebook site.    my name is ciel crosby, just add me as a friend and you will have access.
3112,i'm 24 years old, and pregnant for the first time. with insulin resistance. i'm almost 27 weeks and have managed glucose control perfectly with diet and exercise. to attain even better control though, around 20 weeks my naturopath put me on 300mcg of chromium a day. i'm also taking 2000mg of metformin.obviously glucose control gets harder during the third trimester. i've gradually increased my chromium intake over the last 7 weeks. i'm currently taking 2500mcg - 3000mcg a day now. without it, my control isn't that the best (still not enough for insulin usage, but i'm trying to avoid insulin therapy at all costs anyways).i've googled, but cannot find any relevant information. can taking <3000mcg of chromium gtf a day be harmful to my child? i'd imagine uncontrolled blood sugar would outweigh the risks of overdoing it on the chromium, right?. and i'd assume a vitamin is better than adding more medication into my diet?
3113,i have a 6 year old son. has seemed lethargic lately, but with no obvious symptoms. told his pediatrician who then ordered labs. antinuclear antibody = negative. c reactive protein= negative. chem shows potassium of 5.2mmol/l (ref. says that is high). bun/creat ratio = 33 (also says is high). all other chems were in normal range. son has had history of bladder pain, urgency to urinate, though not recently. no sign of ut infection when that happened. son has seemed kind of sickly for the last 3 or so years, but is growing fine and usually has a good appetite.cbc test results as follows:wbc 10.2     x10e3/ulrbc 4.29     x10e6/ulhgb 12.2        g/dlhct 35.8 %mcv 83.4     flmch 28.4    pgmchc 34.1 g/dlrdw 12.9    %platelet 381    x10e3/ulgrans% 33.9     (low according to reference)lymphs% 54.5 (high according to reference)monos % 6.9eos % 4.3baso% 0.4gran# 3.5 t/cmmlymphs# 5.9    t/cmmmono# 0.7    t/cmmeos#    0.4    t/cmmbasos# 0.0    t/cmmif i've calculated the absolute lymphocyte count correctly, they are too high. should we be concerned? what should we do next?thank you.

3117,my son is nearing 12 months and is a very restless sleeper. he wakes up almost every hour. always has. sometimes he falls back to sleep by himself with the help of his pacifier, other times bottle or cuddling. my husband works full time during the day, and i work 3 days a week, midnight shift. he visits grandma at night sometimes also, once or twice a week. i can't figure out if it's his unpredictable schedule that is keeping him from restful sleep, or if something else is wrong with him. my mother-in-law seems to think he has pinworm; however he is a very happy baby. in addition, both my husband and my inlaws think he doesn't eat enough. he wets and poops an adequate amount. are they just being paranoid, or should i be concerned?

3125,let me begin by giving a little background. i am a recent college graduate. i have moved back home for the next few months until i begin graduate school. while i am at home i have a lot of down time, and was really struggling to find a job and my way here. my boyfriend has been fairly patient through my ups and downs. he has stood by me through a lot. we have been together almost three years now. admittedly i am a bit neurotic. but lately i have been trying very hard to keep my bad habits, checking up all the time for example, in check. he still has another year left in school so it is really hard being away from him. but right before i left and continuing on until now we have been having a lot of trouble. we have been fighting a lot. honestly the fights are usually brought on by me being neurotic, but lately i feel like he is initiating these fights. and the way he argues with me feels unfair and hurtful. i will usually say something to him, sometimes a little snippy but never anything big, and he will blow up and start yelling or sending texts in all caps. then he will refuse to apologize or take responsibility.i love him a lot. but i'm scared us being together isn't right now that we are apart.... for an undetermined amount of time. i know it's not possible to know for sure what to do. but am i reading into these fights to much, is this normal? i want to be with him but i can't always tell whether i am being to critical or something is really wrong.

3135,ok, so i had an u/s today, the gestational sac measured 6 weeks, the tech saw a yolk sac and thought she saw a fetal pole but wasn't positive, she said i'll have to go back in 7 to 10 days, my question is if i am 6 weeks should a fetal pole be visable.    i had a blighted ovum in 11/06, then went on to have a healthy pregnancy in 12/06, delivered dd in 9/07 so i haven't gotten a period since and therefore we have nothing to judge conception by.    thanks and i hope everyone had a blessed holiday and has a happy healthy new year.
3136,how can i tell when i'm ovulating? my bbt #s are up and down sometimes it looks like ovulation but then its not?
3137,so i meet this guy three weeks ago, saw each other three times, yes and had sex.    he couldn't preform, but he call as usually every night around 930 and we talked for over an hour at a time.    we talked all this week but he did not metion getting togeather.    he had told me be was testing me to see if i would call last week.    i called him one night this week and he did not answer, but he told me it was because his ex came over and was venting to him.    he said he didn't want to hear but did anyway.    he never called but told me about it the next day.    should i email and ask him what he is doing tonight?    should i call him after work?    it takes everything i have not to call or think of him.    in the past i have jumped right in and forgot my kids, but i can't do this again.    i have to stop the pattern and i don't want to drive this guy away, but what if i am just trying to escape into some one else's life because i hate mine right now.    what should i do let him contact me.

3140,i was having sex with my boyfriend, and everything was fine and normal. however, 2 hours later when we tried to do it again, my vagina was completely dry, and even after stimulating/more foreplay it still remained dry. this is strange because i usually have no problems with natural lubrication, and in most cases i am usually too wet - but this time it was different.does anyone know why this could have happened? i have recently started taking the birth control pill, but i've only been on it for 4 weeks, so i don't think it should have had that much effect...
3141,if i have a regular 28 day and ovulate on my own, does ovulation happen at exactly the half waypoint in my cycle?    today is the predicted o day according to everything i read online.    but my cm was earlier this week and my temp spiked earlier this week too.    and i had some achy twinges in my sides then too.    ii guess i could have ovulated early?    is that possible?    would that make my cycle shorter too?

3143,i have a quiet type 13 year old daughter. she seldom would sit down and have casual conversation with me and her mom. she would prefer chatting, or texting friends in her room. one day, i called her attention so that we can talked on what was going on. i made it clear to her that while in school you can have all the opportunity and time for bonding with school mates, but once you are out of the school premises the focus for bonding is with us, your parents. this house rule was not followed so i regulated her internet use and confiscated her cellphone. after several months, i found out that she acquired a cellphone and was texting a male friend. i scolded her for this because there is a prior instruction to distance herself from male friends. as a result, she has become more evasive, and communicating with her has become more difficult even if i tried to forget what had happened and tried to restore a loving relationship. what must i do next?
3144,http://news.yahoo.com/ohio-governor-signs-law-allowing-guns-bars-224705191.htmlcolumbus, ohio (reuters) - ohio republican governor john kasich on thursday signed into law a bill that allows gun owners in the state to carry concealed weapons into bars and other places where alcohol is served.the measure, which was forwarded to kasich on june 22 by the ohio general assembly, was signed on thursday afternoon. kasich is scheduled to sign the ohio budget later thursday.businesses can ban concealed weapons on their premises for safety reasons if the want to and some, like the cincinnati bengals football team, have indicated they will continue to bar gun owners from bringing firearms into the stadium.the law also prohibits gun owners from consuming alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they carry their weapons into bars.the new laws allow residents to carry concealed handguns into licensed establishments in the state, including shopping malls and sporting venues.the new law also allows a person with a concealed carry license to transport a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle without securing it in a holster, case, bag or box -- and allows them to remove a handgun from a secure location.opponents of the laws had said that mixing guns and alcohol would endanger public safety. supports argued that the laws bring ohio into line with other states that have concealed carry rules.
3145,i am a 34 year old female and only 100 pounds. i have always been thin (and many of my friends and family say blessed by being thin). that is one of the reasons i moved from the midwest to the southwest-because i had no meat on my bones in the winter and thus could never get warm. i am healthy in every other way (except i am taking meds for depression, which i am currently trying to decrease the dose). i eat healthy, most days 3 meals a day; on the weekends maybe only 2 meals a day. i have recently begun drinking protein shakes with a combination of rice/hemp/whey protein. i am lactose-intolerant, so can only drink rice or almond milk, and not a vegetarian.i also work in the herb dept. at an ayurvedic alternative health clinic. my coworker, who is an herbalist, recommended the protein shakes to me, along with some dietary suggestions.    i am trying to eat more pancakes, but i don't always have time to make them. i am trying to make healthy recipes from an ayurvedic cookbook which are recommended for my body type, which is called vata (for those interested in ayurveda, which is the thousands-year old philosophy of health from india, you may learn more at www.ayurveda.com, or do your own search). it's kind of time-consuming cooking in the kitchen all the time, when none of my efforts at eating healthy seem to put any weight on my body. however, i don't want to go the way of eating fast-food all the time, although once in a while i do get cravings for cheeseburgers and i satisfy them!i've been tested for celiac disease (which i don't have), for thyroid problems (which i don't have).and just to be clear, i am not anorexic, i truly want to fill out, and not look like a teenager- i want to look like i'm 34!does anyone have any recipe suggestions or websites that could help me gain weight?
3146,i have been waking up every day for the last 9 months, although they have been worse the last 2 months with very puffy eyes on the upper and lower eye areas. only a little bit on the top though. i have never had any trouble with allergies my whole life, but i realize this could be one reason. they aren't itchy or watery at all though. i do notice a lot of redness inside the lower lids especially the left eye the is a cluster of redness like broken blood vessels there. i feel so frustrated and upset, and quit frankly stressed about this situation. i just moved to a new city and i need to find a job and make new friends. i also just finalized my divorce and would like to start dating men too. but with the puffy eye problem i'm having i feel that dating is out of the picture for now. i tried all of the puffy eye so called solutions and none of them work on me. i am at a loss, but i have no insurance so i don't know what to do. please does anyone have any information or had any similar problems happen to them.
3147,since my mother passed away in may, i have been trying to get along better with my dad, but he doesn't seem to want to do anything with me.    it seems like the only time i even see or talk with my dad is when i need money for my son's speech therapy or afterschool care (which my parents offered to help me with).    he has a new girlfriend and seems to be spending more time with her than with his own children.    he lives nearby so i don't see why he doesn't want to spend time with me or my son (his only grandson).    when i call him to see how he is, its a two minute call where all he says he is doing fine.    i don't understand why he doesn't want to talk or spend time with me?    i was thinking that maybe it was becasue i remind him too much of my mother, but i guess now that mom is gone, he has his freedom and is taking advantage of it.i don't know what else to do.    should i just give him his space and hope that one day he comes around?thanks!
3148,every time my boyfriend and i have sex i hurt for 3 to 5 days after. i get sharp pains up my lower abdomin(abdomen)and it stings when i pee. i have been to see the clinicians in my town, and have been treated for my sympoms, but never diagnosed. they even told me i had an infection and not to have sex for 6 months. we stuck to the plan, but in the end it is the same thing. i saw a gynochologyst once, and he said there was nothing wrong with me. i don't get it, and it is straining my relationship. any ideas?
3149,well... im 34 weeks and 3 days pregnant and im 19yrs old a girl as you may have guessed. i have adult adhd, asthma (brought on be allergies), hayfever, allergic to wheat, allergic to dozens of pollens, grasses, plants, trees, and scents, and and i think thats all.anyways, to the problem: ive had this sudden (last 2 days) onset of numbness and weakness (mostly numbness; but only on the inside of my arm, if that makes any sense; my skin isnt numb at all) in my entire right arm and hand. it started in my wrist, then radiated upwards in a line to my middle finger. it has since spread outwards and upwards to engulf my entire hand and all the way up to 2 inches above my elbow. its starting in my left arm too now and in the same place. its already to the middle of my hand. im not really worried about it, but it doesnt ever go away or ease up. it was really gradual in starting, but has since been accompanied by some small weakness and numbness in my legs (both legs equally). theres no tingling at all, and its getting harder to use my right hand to grip things.before my left arm started to feel weak or numb, as a kind of test, i held one finger from each of my fiance's hands in each of my hands, and squeezed as hard as i could. he said that my left hand felt normal/what he expected it would be, while the right one was firm, but it was less than half of what the left one was. i have an appointment to see my dr on the 7th, but should i wait??? or is this something that should be addressed immediately by the er??
3150,i got my period earlier this month...may 3rd..lasted 4-5 days..and today may 22,..i went to the restroom and wipped..a light red/pink stain on toilet tissue. it was weird because it didn't look like how a period should look..real dark red and heavy(sorry to be soo detailed). whats bugging me is that i am not due for my priod until next month june 3rd!..i feel bloated, i can recall..two days ago.. i had this really bad migraine(unbearable)..and the day before that..a cramp that was off the wall!..and today i just argued with my bf..and kicked him out of the house for a few hours..last but not least, i have been making trips to the bathroom..how many times a night..and i don't even drink water before i go to bed. pls someone give me some input on this situation..i am just confused why i am seeing slight bleeding before my period..which is suppose to be due in 2 weeks! thanks.
3151,i had my tubes tied a little over a year ago after having my second son. about a little over a week ago my vagina started itching uncontrollably. a couple of days after that my breast started aching, periodically. now, the vaginal itching has stopped but my breasts are so sore that i can't even touch them. in addition, i have a constant bloated feeling, more frequent urination, occasional nausea and lightheadedness, and i am having discomfort in my right pelvic area that follows around to my lower back on the same side. i had a normal menstrual cycle that started on the 3rd of oct and lasted 6 days. i took a pregnancy test the other day and it came back negative. my best friend is concerned that i may have a tubal pregnancy and wants me to go to the hospital. i just moved to a new state so i don't have any health insurance and don't want to go unless absolutely necessary. is it possible that i could be pregnant, either tubal or normal, and it isn't showing up positive?
3152,i am 9 weeks pregnant, and i only feel breast tenderness and notice breast growth on one side.    i am naturally small breasted, so any change is very noticeable, and now the one breast is about 50% larger than the smaller one (it hasn't changed at all, except for those goose bumps).    am i doomed to have crooked breasts for my pregnancy or will they even out???

3156,am preparing to go back to work in another 10 days. my dd is almost 2 mos and 3 weeks. she does not take anything other than the breast. i tried b.m in bottle, and by spoon, formula in bottle and by spoon.the only time she cries is when i (or her nanny) tries to give her milk/formula from a bottle or spoon, she cries all through the feeding and stops sudden with a sigh as soon as we stop!!all that we can manage her to take is an ounce by spoon, bottle absolutly no..i will be taking her as well as the nanny to work, i can provide them a bed room, and can feed on demand, but there are days when i need to go out of the office for half a day or so, i want to make her preapred for it by having at least one feed of formula out of her nanny.please give me ideas as to how can i succeed in doing it.i have been trying since one month with the bottle, but three days with spoon.also how many ounces should she get as an average in that feeding.( i know about it from the books, but reality may be something entirely different.)appreciate any suggestions.
3157,i have been potty-training my son for the past 8 months, since right before he turned 3.    i put him right into underwear and right on the real toilet.    he was into it at first, especially as i started with small candy rewards.    soon the rewards started to wear off and he would only go on the potty when he felt like getting a treat.    he tells me he doesn't have to or he'll make me chase him around the house to get him on the potty when i clearly know he has to go.    he is actually great with pooping.    he will go without prompting on the potty, which is awesome.    however, he has pee accidents all the time.    i have tried everything...stickers, charts, praise, toys, special outings, no response, yelling, taking stuff away, using a timer, not asking him and just taking him, etc.    the problem is, he doesn't care if he has an accident and he doesn't care if he sits in wet underwear and pants.    the strategy as of late has been me just taking him at timed intervals, which sort of works, but to me, isn't really potty-trained since he won't go unless i make him.    i just want him to go when he has to...i just don't know what to do and am at my wit's end.    please help!!

3159,my 7yr old son had an eye test a couple of months ago as he has a lazy eye & they checked the backs of the eyes & said the verves in both eyes looked slightly pale & wanted an mri scan done of the brain & orbits.    we took him private as we were sick with worry & thankfully the results come back clear.    they have since then checked the pressures in both eyes which again were fine.    we have now been left in limbo & do know what is causing this or could it just be something he was born with & nothing to worry about?
3160,i have a 24 days cycle. my lmp was on tuesday december 29th 2009 (12/29/09).i was told my high fertility day was on sunday january 3rd 2010 (01/03/10)and my ovulation days are from monday january, 4th 2010 to sunday january, 10th 2010 (01/04/10    01/10/10).we started having intercourse on my supposedly high fertility day (01/03/10) and plan on doing such thru my ovulation days (01/04/10    01/10/10)will this increase our chance of getting pregnant? we have been trying to get pregnant for 6 months now and it not fun anymore.i am an only child, so is my husband. however i had an 8 years old from my previous marriage. my husband on the other end never married before and has no child.    he loves my child dearly but we long thought that having a child together will be a joyful and great experience. we both love children, we are desperate to have one together, we would like to break the   only child   myth that  s both in each of our family (my parents are only children so are his parents). my son is crying for a sibling and my in laws would love to have a grand child before they are no longer among us.my first child came along with no difficulties, no calculations but this time it is nerves wrecking to have my second.    please help me understand these confusing calculations about fertility and ovulation. thank you.
3161,last wednesday i woke up with tender lymph nodes under my arms.    it was worse thursday and progressed to really bad by sunday.    not only are the lymph nodes under my arms swollen, but my breasts are very sore as well.    today, the nodes down the underside of my arms have become painful as well.    this afternoon, i had serious discomfort in my chest and back that improved after i took extra strength tylenol and sat still for an hour or more.    i went to urgent care on sunday and was told it was lymphadenitis.    the doctor there gave me 500 mg amoxcicillin to take 3 times a day.    but, it seems to be getting worse, not better.     i feel awful.    headache, tired, and sore all over when i get up from lying down.    what else can i do?    when do i need to consider returning to a doctor?    what kind of doctor?
3162,this is kind of a long story. but i need to ask and get some reassurance! ok, i had a one night stand with a friend on june 3rd 2010. we didn't use protection and had an accident. well on june 13th, i went to the er due to some cramping and bleeding and was worried i was having another miscarriage (i had one in august of 2009). it turns out i did have a miscarriage i was about 5 or 6 weeks along. i don't know if my boyfriend fathered that baby or my one night stand friend. but about a month or so after the miscarriage i was feeling nauseous so i took a test and it was positive. i am now almost 39 weeks pregnant and i'm really concerned that my one night friend is possibly the father. the only thing is i had that miscarriage between having sex with him and my now boyfriend. i've used a conception calculator and from that it says my one night friend can't be the father, the math and dates just don't add up. but i'm just going crazy thinking about this every day! am i crazy or should i be worried? any answers will help please!

3166,for the last 4 months i've been getting quantative hcgs done so i can take my provera to bring on my period and start my clomid again.    the numbers on the hcg have always been less than 2.    i took a hpt this month and it was negative so they ordered bloodwork.    i work at a drs office and looked up the results and the number is 8.    i have yet to hear from my gyne but i'm going insane.    is this still a negative or is there some kind of slight possibility that i might be?    i'm really hoping that there is some kind of miracle working here and i maybe ovulated late cause after trying for 15 months it kind of starts to wear on you!!            any advice??     thanks!!!
3167,hi there,a week ago, i had shaved in the genital area, and accidently cut myself on the razor on the scrotum...it bleeded for like 5secs but i cleaned it with antiseptic and that was that...i had a bath 2 days ago where i noticed a small spot, i assumed it maybe the cut from when i had shaved, and it was itchy so i scratched it, since then it has been itchy at random times, yesterday whilst having a bath, i noticed a small bump, like a pimple which was whitish, i tried popping but nothing happened, the skin around was flaky and red, almost like a patch...i'm really concerned about this, and my gp only has female docs, which i really don't want to go and tell them, too shy to do that...could you advise me better or tell me of some treatment for this...to tell you, i have not been sexually active for more than a year, i do not masturbate either...thank you
3168,my boyfriend and me had rough sex and afterwards i noticed bleeding, not like i would during my period, but not extremely light like a lot of people describe it. there was burning and pain during that time, but it went away by the next day. i have bled every time during intercourse now (which is about two or three times), and usually stops completely by the next day. during these two or three time after the time we had rough sex i felt no discomfort. im afraid of the idea of being pregnant because ive heard sex could irritate the cervix and cause bleeding without discomfort. is it possible i have damage even though the bleeding stops and i don  t feel pain? and what are the cures doctors typically give for damage to the vagina if so?

3184,part 1joshua hollandtoday is the 100th anniversary of the federal income tax, which was signed into law by president woodrow wilson on october 3, 1913.to mark the occasion, moyers & company caught up with david cay johnston, who has probably forgotten more about our tax code than most economic experts ever knew. johnston won a pulitzer prize in 2001 for his comprehensive reporting on taxes and tax avoidance in the new york times, and then authored a best-selling book on the subject, perfectly legal: the covert campaign to rig our tax system to benefit the super-rich    and cheat everybody else.below is a lightly edited transcript of our discussion.joshua holland: when we got into world war ii, individuals and families paid 38 percent of federal income taxes and corporations picked up the other 62 percent. last year, individuals and families paid 82 percent of federal income taxes and corporations paid just 18 percent. how did this happen?david cay johnston: all modern societies require a large public sector to provide the goods and services on which the private sector depends. so you need commonwealth services    education, basic research, statistical gathering and civil law enforcement    a whole host of activity than can only be provided through the public sector.now, corporations have a concentrated interest in the taxes they pay and the capacity to lobby for changes and make campaign donations to rent, or in some cases buy politicians   votes. over a long period of time, they saw to it that we change these tax laws and shifted this burden.we also dramatically increased the size of the federal government during the period from before world war ii until now and some of the additional money you  re seeing is the result of increased social security taxes and medicare taxes    some programs that benefit people generally, and that i think we should look at as efficient buying at the wholesale level, rather than retail.holland: unpack that for me, david.johnston: sure. corporations in the days before world war ii were essentially domestic operations, with a few exceptions. and we now have a global economy. and in the global economy, corporations all around the world are going to push to get the lowest tax    or no tax at all in some places    and then use that to pressure the us government to ease their tax burdens.they  ve also, by the way, put in place innumerable little rules changes involving accounting and depreciation    that is writing down the value of equipment as it  s being used up    and other things, to reduce their bills.holland: and does this help explain why we have a very low tax burden overall, relative to other wealthy countries, but a lot of americans feel that they  re being taxed to death?johnston: well, one of the reasons some americans feel they  re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes, which are low compared to other modern countries, and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries    a lot of our health care costs, higher education costs, admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things    lo and behold, we end up being a relatively high-tax country. but it depends on how you analyze the data.and let me give you one killer figure: we spend so much money on our health care in this country    or as i prefer to think of it, sick care in this country    that for every dollar that the other 33 modern economies spend for universal coverage, we spend $2.64. and this is done using something called   purchasing parity dollars,   so they  re truly comparable. so we spend $2.64 per person and still have almost 50 million people with no coverage and 30 million with limited coverage, and these other countries spend far less with universal coverage.here  s how much that costs: in the year 2010, if we had had the french health care system, which is one of the most expensive in the world, it would have provided universal coverage and it also would have saved us so much money that we could have eliminated the individual income tax that year and all else would have been equal. our excess health care costs above those of the french were a little over 6 percent of the economy and the income tax in 2010 brought in about 6 percent of the economy.http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/04/america-has-low-taxes-so-why-do-people-feel-ripped-off/

3187,has anyone else had problems with pricebusterrx resently? i ordered yesterday but it seems all their products are out of stock
3188,i    ended my    period    like    a    the    other    day ago and i have    this    like    light     brown     poop looking    discharge    comeing    out my     vagina    when i    whip    my    self    and i    wanna    know    what    it    is     if its old    blood    or    if     its    something else    i    should    worry    about     but    i    only    get    it    around    when i have    or    end my     periods
3189,i've posted this quite a few times in the genetics and cancer forums... with zero (0) responses. so, i'm asking this question, here, with the hope that someone can offer me some insights.this question is for anyone who has knowledge and/ or experience regarding genetic testing (counseling). my recent mammogram returned with benign findings... however, due to extensive family history of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer; and, given my own history of developing abnormal yet non-cancerous growths in my breast, the radiologist  s recommendation was for me to undergo genetic testing. on the other hand, my lifelong family physician questions the value of this approach,      knowing that [i] will not be having children.   i  m somewhat inclined to agree with my doctor... and forgo testing. however, my mother (whose two sisters died of breast cancer) is pushing for it... and, my sister, who is an ovarian cancer survivor also feels that i should go for it. before i make a decision as to which way to go with this, i  d like to know the insights and opinions (pros and cons) of anyone who has had... or know of anyone who has had... genetic testing.thank you in advance.

3193,i have been spotting for the last day and a half now.    i am irregular so i dont know when my period comes, but usually by the 3rd month af would come, but its been since the begining of november and i havent had a period still.    usually when i am going to start i have cramping a week before or the day of af.    my husband and i are trying to get pregnant. i was just wondering what it means if i am spotting? ( its a light pinkish color)
3194,sorry if any of this is tmi!my periods have been messed up since i had the depo shot in jan of 08' it was my 1st and last becase me and my husband had decided to try for our 2nd child ..now we have been at it for a year and no luck....i dont know if the shot has made me infertile or what....anyways my last period was jan.10th 2009...all the home pregnancy test are telling me that im not pregnant but my body is saying other wise! and when i go to the dr. all he wants to do is put me back on birth control...i swear ever since i started trying after my son was born i have been on 4 or 5 diff birthcontrols and the depo was #2!!!!!
3195,i am really concerned i have had a non-stop period for almost a year and when i had insurance i spoke to my doctor and she blew it off like i was over-reacting.    i am 22 a virgin and have never taken birth-control, i dont smoke, rarely drink and am not quite sure what could be causing this.    also, i know this might sound strange but i swear it smells sort of metallic and really strong but no one else can smell it but me.    what should i do i don't have a job and no longer have insurance so i can't go to a doctor and get it checked especially since the doctors here always seem to be busy and not all that concerned with my personal problems?this discussion is related toabnormal period, constant bleeding.
3196,i had unprotected sex in the 3rd, 5th and 11th. i ovulated on the 8th. on all 3 occasions my partner did pull but he ejaculated on my fsinger's, within seconds i inserted them on all 3 occasions quite deep(yes he knows about this) today im having a tugging feeling in my lower belly alone with a period type ache although i'm not due on for another 11 days. could i of really gotten pregnant by doing this. also can implantation take place this early? i never feel cramos like this until the day of my period. thanks for your advice.

3199,ok, i know i have posted here about 1000 times, but i really need some answers or words of knowledge. here is a little brief history: around the end of august or beginning of september i had unprotected sex with a guy for about 20 minutes ( one time) and then about 2 weeks later (september 15) i had sex again with a new partner ( my current boyfriend), also unprotected, i know very stupid of me. around the last days of october, i developed a very big painful rash in between my buttocks and vaginal lips. i tought at that time that it was irritation from a maxi pad. about a week and a half later the rash started healing, but soon after i developed a smaller rash in the two sides of my vaginal opening, with red painful bumps. i also got this open tear (like a paper cut) right in the area between the vaginal opening and the anal opening. must i add that this was the same area that i got teared when i had sex before from lack of lubrication. up to this day, i still have this rash. it goes away for about 2-3 days and then apprears again, also with the tear. i went to planned parenthood about 2 weeks ago and tested for hsv 1 and 2 and for yeast infection. this last friday, they called me back and informed me that i was hsv 2 negative, but hsv 1 positive. she made it seem like no big deal, and told me it was nothing to worry about. the yeast test also came back negative. my doubts are that i still have this damn rash and i do not know what is, it really is ruining me, i have not had sex since then because i am afraid. i was wondering if it might have been too early to take the test

3205,i am 28 years old and have been taking birth control pills for five years.    recently, my gyn switched me from orthocyclen to mircette because my periods had been starting earlier and earlier and i was getting migraines as soon as i started taking the placebo pills.    i am only two and a half weeks into my first pack of mircette, and i have been bleeding for a full week now.    some days, it is so bad that i need super tampons!    is this because the mircette has a lower dose of estrogen?    also, i am really bloated and feel nauseous all the time, but can't seem to go to the bathroom with any regularity!    this isn't the first time i have switched birth control--i started on orthotricyclen, then switched to orthotricyclen-lo, and finally went to orthocyclen for about two years before being switched to mircette.    i had similar break-through bleeding problems on orthtricyclen-lo, but not the stomach pains and bloating.    should i stick with the mircette, or switch back to orthocyclen?    anything is better than bleeding all month and being as bloated as i am.    i can't remember having these symptoms at the start of any other birth control pills.    i am very uncomfortable!
3206,thanks for your post regarding my earlier questions.    i went to my ob/gyn yesterday and here's what she said:1.    come in every 4 wks unless there are complications or until i start measuring 32 wks (which should be b/n 26-28 wks), then every 2 wks, then every week.2.    won't get another u/s until 19-20 wks.    will just hear the heartbeats next visit.3.    doesn't want me to get u/s until 19-20 wks since this will be the big u/s that checks for abnormalities, gender,etc.4.    said i could do vaginal if bottom one is head down b/c she could probably turn the top baby, but if bottom is breech, then definitely c-section.5.    said twins normally come 3 weeks early but didn't say if she'd induce or not.    i'm assuming she would.again, thanks for your info.    when is your due date?
3207,so i'm 14weeks pregnate. and last night i passed out of no where and don't remember what happened and i was wondering if this is normal? i'm concerned about it if someone could help let me kno
3208,i would like to know if anyone has any inspiring stories regarding pregnancy with a low sperm count to give me some hope!!!! we have been ttc for around 4.5 years, i managed to fall pregnant last year but had a m/c at 14 weeks. since then we have been trying again but so far not even a whiff of a bfp. i am growing more despondant with each month that goes past. i live in the uk and have 2 older children from a previous marriage and a 5 year old son with my partner. i went for help with ttc after the last m/c but the gp was not interested so went private. the private fertility clinic perscribed me with clomid as i was ovulating too early in my cycle and also informed us that my partners s/a was a low on all 3 factors.i recently went back to my dr to see if now a year has passed since my m/c if they would offer any help. they have repeated all the tests fsh, hdg, 21 day bloods, repeated scans etc and mine all came back fine (apart from the above issue) however my partner's came back low/abnormal again.we have been told that without iui or ivf achieving a pregnancy is not impossible but unlikely. we don't qualify for help on the nhs for iui or ivf as we already have a child together so the only other option is private which is far too much money and not something that we can afford :(the advice the gp gave was to adopt/maintain a healthy lifestyle which we already have (no drinking smoking and to stay fit) we both are very active and fit and neither smoke or drink! i also always chart my cyles, use opks and cb fertility monitor so know we hit the right days.... the past few cyles we have been abstaining for 2 days prior to the opk+ to try and increase the sperm count. we use pre-seed, & i take epo and take care of myself by drinking green tea, lots of water, cutting out caffiene etc etc...... i also take folic acid and magnesium and my partner takes zinc and vit c supplements and makes sure no alcohol around o time.....i feel like giving up at the moment - i can't bear to see another bfn and feel like i don't have the strength to carry on as it all seems so pointess. has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to have a sucessful pregnancy?
3209,i went to the dentist yesterday, they extract my wisdom teeth but a small part was left inside it hurts a little i'm really concern about that the dentist said that it was normal but i need a second opinion please help me he also hit me with something and now i have a lot of troble swallowing what i need to do

3211,just had my 191/2 weeks ultrasound and was informed that my baby has 6mm of fluid around his heart. i had the amnio after hearing all the possible outcomes. what should i expect at my next appointment.
3212,hello, i am brand spankin' new here.    i had surgery a month ago, i couldn't tell you what kind other than it has to do with a loop in the name of it.    i had hpv and the dr. went in and scraped it out.    that is my understanding.i am still bloated, no matter what herbal or homeopathic remedies, or otc pills i take. my diet has changed to mostly fruits and straight pork, like pork and seeds, i don't like meat any way.    no matter what i eat i blow up.     i am sick of wearing sweat pants, thankfully i can wear them to work.    i haven't been back for the check up and don't know if i will go.    i hate the dr. but since i am on medicare or medicaid ( i don't remember which one) i chose this dr. because people were pushing me to get the surgery done.    i didn't have the leisure to pick one or go talk to one.i know that bloating for a little while is normal but j*&$##!    i had an emergency appendectomy several years ago and didn't bloat.    and my appendix ruptured!now the dr., a week after surgery, tells me he wants me to have a hystorectomy.    ( i guess i can't spell it).    i have been short changed by dr.'s and don't trust them, i accidentally found out that i didn't get a pre-op appointment to be told what to expect during surgery or after surgery.    the only time i have heard from the dr. was 3 days after surgery when he told me he wanted me to have the hysterectomy.    (ha, i figured out how to spell it)i used to want the hysterectomy when i was a teen because of sever pain with cramps.    now, i don't trust so i don't want to do it.    i don't have periods any more anyway thanks to the depo.i just want the bloating to go away.    if that means having the hysto then so be it!comments appreciated, i know that a lot will say that i should just go back to the dr. but that probably won't happen, his god complex and all that.thank youkiruru
3213,immigration and welfare/found on the federation for american immigration websitealthough the united states   welfare rolls are already swollen, every year we import more people who wind up on public assistance: immigrants. many immigrants are poor; indeed, that is why they come here. the immigrants we admit are much poorer than the native population and are increasing the size of our impoverished population. as a result, the share of immigrant households below the poverty line (18 percent) is much higher than the share of native households that are poor (11 percent)  nearly twice as high. and immigrant households are more likely to participate in practically every one of the major means-tested programs. immigrant use of welfare programs (21 percent) is 43 percent higher than non-immigrants   use (15 percent).1each year, state governments spend an estimated $11 billion to $22 billion to provide welfare to immigrants.2why are immigrants on welfare?some people mistakenly think that immigrants are not eligible for welfare. several years ago, congress did attempt to render immigrants ineligible for most forms of welfare. however, subsequent backpedaling by congress and the executive branch has undone most of those reforms. furthermore, many immigrant families get welfare through the eligibility of their u.s. citizen children. (it is also important to realize that even when immigrants are ineligible for federal welfare programs, the burden of their support is simply shifted over to the state and local welfare agencies.)refugees, asylees, and all amnestied illegal aliens are exempt from the public charge requirement.3 congress has decided that the american people will serve as the sponsors for these immigrants and pick up the tab for their support.all other immigrants must pass a public charge test and have a u.s. sponsor or sponsors willing to pledge their income to support them. before a potential immigrant receives an immigration visa, american consular officers are supposed to evaluate whether he or she is likely to become a public charge, and, if so, to deny the visa. the consular officer is supposed to take into account a variety of factors: the amount of support the sponsor can give, the resources and skills of the applicant, and any special conditions (such as age or infirmity) that might affect the applicant  s need for support. the immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 set the new legal standard for the evaluation: the sponsor of the applicant must have an annual income of at least 125 percent of the federally designated poverty level. there are several problems with this standard:* the sponsorship income level, only 25 percent higher than the poverty level, is so low that it does not prevent immigrants from going on welfare; in fact, it almost guarantees it. say a sponsor begins with an income of 200 percent of poverty level and is, therefore, not considered   legally poor.   but after splitting that income with the immigrant, each will be at 100 percent of the poverty level. where before we had one non-poor person, now we have two poor people. since eligibility for some welfare programs kicks in before one  s income drops to 125 percent of poverty level, immigrants can easily wind up on welfare.* while immigrants who receive welfare can be deported for violating the conditions under which they were admitted, this provision is rarely enforced; in fact, only twelve people have been deported under this provision since 1980.4 administrative rulings have held that an immigrant cannot be held responsible for receiving welfare unless the welfare agencies have sent the immigrant a bill for their services, demanded payment, and been refused payment.5 since welfare agencies do not do this, it is virtually impossible for an immigrant to be charged with violating the public charge provisions that can lead to deportation.* furthermore, numerous forms of welfare are not considered under the public charge test, including food stamps, pre-natal care, nutrition programs, housing assistance, energy assistance, job training programs, child care services, free or reduced school lunch, public shelters, health clinics, medicaid, and any cash welfare programs that are not the family  s sole source of income.6 this insulates immigrants from being considered public charges unless they are completely dependent on welfare.what types of welfare are immigrants eligible for?as of the 1996 welfare reform bill, the following applies to eligibility for federal and state funded welfare programs:* legal immigrants are barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years after entering the country and barred from ssi and food stamps until citizenship. they are also barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years.7* benefits available to immigrants include school lunch and breakfast programs, immunizations, emergency medical services, disaster relief, and others programs that are necessary to protect life and safety as identified by the attorney general, regardless of immigration status.8* illegal immigrants are barred from the following federal public benefits: grants, contracts, loans, licenses, retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post secondary education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. states are barred from providing state or locally funded benefits to illegal immigrants unless a state law is enacted granting such authority.9welfare reform failed to solve the problemdespite expectations that the 1996 welfare reform bill would cause significant changes in immigrant welfare use, it has actually remained at the same level. the 1996 welfare reforms failed because while the legislation cut immigrants off from certain welfare programs, the savings that resulted from those cuts were not high enough to offset the increased usage of the remaining programs, due to the continuing high number of immigrants entering the u.s. every year.while both temporary aid to needy families (tanf) and food stamp use have declined by four percent, the decline did not result in any significant savings, as those costs were offset by increases in medicaid use, which has increased among immigrant households. the total combined value of benefits and payments received by immigrant households from welfare programs remained almost the same, averaging almost $2,000 in 2001, about 50 percent higher than natives. such high rates of immigrant welfare use, combined with the rapidly increasing immigrant population, has resulted in a four percent increase in the number of immigrant households on welfare, from 14 percent in 1996 to 18 percent in 2000.10outlook for the futurethe highest welfare use rates for immigrants are in new york (30 percent), california (28 percent), massachusetts (25 percent), and texas (25 percent).12immigrants are eleven percent of our population, but they are 20 percent of the poor population. unless our immigration policies are reevaluated and changed accordingly, welfare usage and subsequent costs will remain high.instead of addressing the problem, some in congress have suggested measures that would make it even worse, such as proposals to increase immigrants   eligibility for benefits. the congressional budget office estimates that making legal immigrants eligible for medicaid and the state children  s health insurance program (schip) would cost an estimated $2.24 billion over ten years.11if we are to have any hope of reducing poverty in the u.s., our immigration laws must be revised and returned to the sensible practice of excluding aliens who are likely to become public charges and to deport those who do.

3216,okay , i'm 20 yrs old and me and my boyfriend have been sexually active. for the past week or two of our sex life, i've been having a ripping pain sensation. i've asked him to look and see if it's been ripped and he said nothing was ripped. we start to have sex and it hurts so much like i'm being ripped, but after he gets going, the pain goes away. i'm not having a problem being aroused, i generate a lot of moisture. :) i am just wondering if there is something i can do to fix it, or will it fix on it's own. i don't have any insurance and i can't afford to see a ob-gyn. so i was just looking for some advice or conclusion.
3217,a little history. i'm 28, female, 3 healthy pregnancies and one miscarriage. i've had regular periods forever, until recently. they have been getting more and more painful until they just stopped coming, last one started nov 22. but the cramps didn't go away. went to see a doc, and in unrelated news, tested positive for hep, b and c. pregnancy tests, both urine and blood, were negative. so my usual get through the pain with tylenol routine isn't possible now, due to my already overworked liver, and while waiting on a gyn specialist appointment (scheduled for today) my period finally showed up...4 months late and with a vengeance. the abdominal pain is nearly unbearable, and i can't take anything for it. what's more, no one is especially concerned about my lower abdominal pain, and everytime i point it out they're very dismissive because the liver is in the upper right quadrant, so there's no reason for the lower ab pain. **uhm, the lower abdominal pain is what brought me to the doc to start with!!** if it's not related to the hep, then figure out what it is and fix it, or i'm going back to taking too much tylenol, liver be damned.i should mention, my mother underwent a radical hysterectomy for chocolate cysts and endometriosis when i was 8. my aunt (her sister) had the same procedure for the same reason when she was 22. my grandmother had gynecological issues, as well, but it was some 50-odd years ago and no one's really sure why, although endo and cysts is a fairly safe assumption.so what do you all make of my weird period and damnable pain? it's not hep related, but because it's not hep-related, it's not of importance to my hepatologist and id doc. i'm seeing the gyn/spec today, in an hour, and i'm telling him that if these are the kinds of periods i can expect from here on out, take it all out and be done with it. i can't manage pain with a bad liver, and when i'm looking at months of interferon treatments that can be nearly as horrible as cancer treatments i don't want the additional worry of whether or not i'm going to be in pain from gyn issues.
3218,seminole, okla.    families picked through broken furniture and dented appliances outside their toppled homes on tuesday as garbage trucks scooped up soaking mattresses and other debris left over from violent storms that tore through the southern plains, killing five people and injuring dozens.several tornadoes were reported in oklahoma and kansas as monday's storms moved through the area, dumping hail as big as softballs, splintering homes and downing hundreds of power lines.oklahoma city deputy fire chief cecil clay refused to rule out the possibility of finding more dead but said conditions were tough for rescue workers tuesday.we have heavy fog (and) power lines down making it difficult to see all the hazards out there, he said.the line of storms swept through kansas and into oklahoma monday evening, leveling houses and flipping cars. forecasters using advanced technology, fueled by supercomputers crunching atmospheric data, began predicting the severe weather last week.two people were killed in oklahoma city    including a young boy hit by debris in his home and a man whose recreational vehicle flipped over on top of him    and three in cleveland county, south of the city, officials said. at least 58 others were injured    two of them critically.near seminole, about 60 miles east of oklahoma city, at least two homes were leveled after a tornado tore through the area, emergency management director ernie willis said. the town's airport suffered extensive damage and several planes were destroyed, he said.on tuesday, uprooted trees lay cracked in half, and the faint smell of cedar drifted through the air. utility poles were down, lining parts of oklahoma 99, and pickup trucks carted away damaged mattresses and other items.siblings maria and alejandro martinez sifted through debris tuesday at the site where their mobile home had stood. the storm had blown it off of its foundation and threw it 50 feet away, scattering their furniture, appliances and other household items around the yard.alejandro, 14, said the family was inside their home when it started moving monday evening. they were thrown from the home and suffered cuts and bruises. their father, who also was at home, had a broken arm, they said.it started shaking and the lights went out, maria, 12, said.nearby, yolanda suarez and her relatives tried to salvage what they could from the wreckage. appliances - including a washer, dryer and refrigerator - sat exposed on one of her mobile home after the storm tore off its roof and knocked down walls.the only part of the home left standing was the bedroom suarez hid in.she just ran into the room. she didn't want to leave. she thought it was more dangerous to leave than to stay inside, said her relative victor rodriguez.authorities urged residents to stay off the roads in affected areas to allow rescue workers to search for survivors among the wreckage of their homes. they said they didn't immediately know of anyone who was unaccounted for.i haven't heard of anybody in particular. they're just trying to make sure there's not anybody trapped or stuck in there, said dan cary, the emergency management director for cleveland county.in norman    cleveland county's largest city with about 106,000 residents    tim tegeler checked out the damage to his windows, air conditioner and fence at his home. tegeler, his wife, their daughters and their pet fish had taken shelter in their laundry room until the storms passed.we saw it coming, but the best thing is my family's fine, tegeler said.more thunderstorms were expected tuesday, but they were not predicted to be as severe, said meteorologist ty judd with the national weather service.we're not looking at what we saw yesterday, judd said. he said a preliminary estimate counted 10 tornado touchdowns in oklahoma monday.gov. brad henry and u.s. reps. tom cole and mary fallin were scheduled to tour damaged areas in central oklahoma tuesday afternoon.oklahoma gas and electric reported more than 17,000 customers remained without power tuesday morning, down from more than 34,000 late monday. american electric power reported about 1,500 outages, down from more than 2,500. the oklahoma department of emergency management said rural electric cooperatives had about 30,000 outages.in kansas, the most serious damage was reported in belmont, west of wichita, where several homes were hit and there were widespread power outages. but no injuries were reported.in alfalfa county, sheriff charlie tucker said baseball-sized hail broke the windshields of numerous cars and damaged homes.i came home once to look at my own personal vehicle and the windshield was all bashed out. the grandchildren's swing set was up and now it's gone, so there was straight-line winds that came through, tucker said.____associated press writer ken miller in oklahoma city contributed to this report.eds: recasts;

3225,my ten year old son has had accidents (wetting and messing his pants) since he was potty trained.    these have occurred throughout his life.    i thought he would eventually grow out of it.    i have tried to talk to him about it, he always says he doesnt know why he did it or when he did it.    could it be possible that he does this during an absence seizure?    when he was a baby he had some seizure like activity, when he would cry hard, he would tense up, grit his teeth, pass out and then wake up.    his pediatrican said he was just being stubborn, holding his breath, and i should not be concerned about it.    but now i am beginning to wonder if i should have been concerned.    i have no medical history as i was adopted, so we are figuring things out as we go.    should i have him tested for seizure activity?

3232,my teeth were fine, i felt good an was healthy.    then i had a routine filling, upper left, back 4 weeks ago.    the hygenist had a hard time affixing the tooth clamp and dam and rammed it a few times.    i heard a comment about oh this is a thick needle as the dentist prepared the needle - putting needle in cheek and another in palate.    it hurt in the cheek.    immediately after freezing wore off i took advil for pain which is usual.    as the week progressed the pain became more and more excruciating instead of subsiding.    i returned twice.    first he ground down the area to make sure it wasn't high.    i had been avoiding hot & cold and chewing on that side and was sure i wasn't clenching during the day.    sometimes things would trigger it such as drinking cool water.    the pain would radiate from the tooth into the jaw but sometimes the lower jaw, settle right in front of the ear and give a pinching feeling in the temple.    it was so excrutiating i had to stop what i was doing to lay down with moist heat on it.    by then i took 2 advil and they didn't kick in for an hour and wore off after 3 hours.    the only thing that took the pain away was 3 advil but again, it returned on schedule as the advil wore off.    i was sent to and endo doctor.    he checked things - pressure testing was a-okay, photos okay, no cracks, no sign of root canal needed.    he sent me home saying to take tylenol-3 (for nerve pain) with the advil, test things out and get back to him if it continues. he said that 90% of patients get some inflammation on dental treatment and 90% of endo problems solve themselves.well, this is now 4 weeks of chronic pain and chronically taking advil & now tylenol.    should i just keep up this procedure without checking into anything else?    should i see my md?    i have never suffered this much before.     could it be caused by a reaction to freezing or nerve damage from the needle?any suggestions?

3245,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/iraq-reconstruction_n_2819899.html?ncid=webmail10washington -- in nine years of war in iraq, 4,448 americans died and 32,221 were wounded in battle, leaving behind a deeply divided country steeped in corruption. and despite a $60 billion u.s effort to rebuild iraq, life for most iraqis has not improved significantly, according to a bitter and regretful retrospective by iraqi officials and u.s. diplomats, military officers and politicians.their views come with the final report of the special u.s. inspector general for iraq reconstruction, released wednesday. congress set up the sigir office in november of 2003 to monitor the vast sums of iraqi and u.s. money being spent by the u.s. occupation authorities in baghdad.over nine years, inspector general stuart w. bowen and his staff relentlessly tracked down what happened to the $146 billion in iraqi money and the $60 billion in u.s. funds -- much of it airlifted to iraq in pallets of shrink-wrapped $50 bills. despite the claims of president george w. bush and other u.s. officials that the united states would rebuild an even better iraq after the march 2003 invasion and occupation, the money underperformed, bowen noted dryly in the report.there was misspending of money, said iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki, in one of the colossal understatements contained in the massive report.the one bright spot, the report said, was the $20.2 billion the united states spent to train and equip iraqi security forces, which have managed to keep iraq relatively stable despite rising political tensions and sectarian violence.but apart from the detailed investigations and assessments in the final sigir report, it is the observations of senior iraqi and american officials that are most damning. bowen and his staff talked with maliki and iraqi politicians and jurists, former ambassador ryan crocker, former gen. david petraeus and gen. ray odierno, now u.s. army chief of staff.bush, former vice president **** cheney, former defense secretary donald rumsfeld and l. paul bremer -- who ran iraq in the crucial years of 2003 and 2004 as head of the coalition provisional authority (cpa) -- did not offer their own assessments.there is little chance that the united states, given the difficult lessons of its wars in iraq and afghanistan, will embark on a major invasion and military occupation any time soon. but if it did, the ineptness and hubris of the u.s.-led reconstruction effort will serve as a guide to how it shouldn't be done.the level of fraud, waste and abuse in iraq was appalling, sen. susan collins (r-maine) told sigir. she said she had urged the white house to make careful loans to iraq for reconstruction, but bush had insisted on a no strings attached approach instead.a senior iraqi bank auditor, dr. abdul basit turki al-sae'ed, who has led many investigations of iraqi government spending, said the flood of u.s. dollars into the country had fostered a triangle of political patronage among iraq's political parties, sectarian groups and government officials that sparked corruption and terrorism.former iraqi prime minister ibrahim al-ja'afari said iraq's oil profits, which in 2003 and 2004 were spent by bremer's cpa, were gravely mismanaged, eroding the country's educational and medical facilities and sapping its ability to provide such basics as electricity.u.s. army chief of staff odierno, who commanded in iraq for six of the war's nine years, said in retrospect it would have been better to have held off major u.s. investments in reconstruction projects until five or six years into the war, when u.s. troops and u.s.-trained and equipped iraqi forces were beginning to bring the violence under control.in 2004, for instance, the u.s. launched an ambitious project to build a sewer and water system in fallujah, a center of intense and bloody sectarian fighting. originally slated to cost $35 million and take 18 months to complete, the project so far has cost $195 million and is scheduled to be finished in 2014.raheem al-ugaili, a judge and head of iraq's commission on public integrity until 2011, pursued dozens of corruption investigations involving u.s.-funded projects until he was fired for reaching too deeply into iraq's political elite.vast amounts of money were wasted without attaining actual intended results, al-ugaili told sigir. he identified one major problem common to u.s. reconstruction efforts: americans excluded iraqis from the planning and prioritizing of projects.but worse than simply wasted money and incomplete projects was the culture of corruption left behind. sketching out a grim picture of iraq's anti-corruption institutions in full retreat, the judge asserted that the level of kickbacks to [iraq government] officials and the volume of money laundering continue to grow, sigir reports.that culture has seeped into the u.s. involvement in afghanistan as well, according to ryan crocker, who served as ambassador to afghanistan from 2011 to 2012 after leading the political-military campaign in iraq from 2007 to 2009 with petraeus. corruption, cost over-runs and unfinished construction of u.s.-funded projects in afghanistan are documented in regular reports from the u.s. special inspector general for afghan reconstruction (sigar), also a congressionally mandated watchdog.crocker told sigar that the united states had done a better job in afghanistan in including local afghans in the planning process. but as in iraq, he said, the united states had launched ambitious projects for which afghans had neither the expertise nor the money to operate.for instance, he said afghanistan lacks the money to maintain the new road system built with reconstruction funds.we're already seeing them crumbling, he said.
3246,i had a hysterectomy at 28. i was embarrased by the fact that i sometimes think i smell so freaking bad, but to hear others are experiencing the same issues makes me feel better. they say no douching but if your periods cleaned out your uterus and vagina. what cleans out your vagina know? i am clean & aware of my body yet i feel like nothing i do makes a difference the odor still remains. does this mean that stuff just sits in there??? i dont know embarassing questions ...need answers too!!
3247,my oldest son is 4 - a young 4, his birthday is in early october.    he just started junior kindergarten this year and is doing pretty well, despite being one of the youngest in his class (entry into school is by calendar year here - ie. all kids born at any point in 2006 were eligible to attend junior kindergarten in the 2010-2011 school year).anyway, our latest task is helping him learn how to do up his zipper independently.    he can dress himself fine otherwise (except for buttons).    his teacher says that his fine motor skills are a bit weak and he just needs help strengthening his hands (she suggested using play doh - hiding something small inside and getting him to dig it out, make things like letters, numbers and shapes with it, etc.).    now she's handing out zipper licenses in class to the children who can do up their zippers independently and so we've been working with our son to help him master this skill.    he's made some progress, in that he can now place his hands in the correct spots for manoeuvering the zipper into the right spot, but, although he can pull the zipper up fine, he can't start it by himself.    he has always been a bit slow in figuring these things out - but he always does, so i'm not deeply concerned about it.    i just wonder if anyone has any tips or suggestions for me in order to facilitate this?i'm dreading teaching him how to tie shoe laces....!!    ;)
3248,http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/29/11941848-with-texas-win-romney-secures-delegates-to-win-nomination?liteupdated 9:45 p.m. et -- mitt romney won the republican primary in texas on tuesday, a victory that gives him more than the 1,144 delegates needed to secure his party's presidential nomination.following a bruising primary season earlier this year that extended longer than many republicans had hoped, nbc news projected that romney had finally won the necessary delegates to secure the nomination, though the former massachusetts governor won  t earn the official nod until august's republican national convention in tampa.the race for the republican nomination has been largely over since the april 3 primary in wisconsin. romney's win in that contest prompted the eventual withdrawals of his remaining rivals: rick santorum, newt gingrich, and ron paul. it also hastened the onset of president barack obama's own re-election offensive versus romney.i am honored that americans across the country have given their support to my candidacy and i am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the republican party's 2012 presidential nominee, romney said in a statement tuesday evening. our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last three and a half years behind us.romney spent the evening at a closed-doors fundraiser in las vegas with gingrich and reality television star donald trump.while conservatives appear to have rallied behind the former massachusetts governor, the long campaign season was not without its consequences for romney.the republican has been fundraising aggressively to make up for money spent during the nomination battle, which depleted, in part, his relative financial parity versus obama.appearing at a campaign event is las vegas, gop presidential hopeful mitt romney tells supporters that he will focus on putting americans back to work if he is elected president.but more significantly, the obama campaign has been turning some of the most stinging attacks on romney from other republicans and revived them for use in the general election.i have no illusions about the difficulties of the task before us. but whatever challenges lie ahead, we will settle for nothing less than getting america back on the path to full employment and prosperity, romney said in his victory statement. on november 6, i am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the american promise and restoring our country to greatness.  case-in-point: the obama campaign has spent much of the past two weeks attacking romney's experience at bain capital, the private equity firm romney had co-founded. that is a line of attack first advanced by gingrich and texas gov. rick perry in january.romney's continued advantage versus obama, though, lies with an economic recovery that still rests on precarious footing.may's nbc news/wall street journal poll found that half of americans judged last month's jobs report as unsatisfactory. that dampened optimism for a recovery -- and, in turn, for obama -- could become a potent political weapon for romney, especially if continued economic unrest in europe slows the pace of the recovery in the u.s

3254,hi everyone,just a little background on me, i'm 31 and exercise and in good health (thank god).i'm just wondering is taking these supplements daily over doing it?- omega 3 - 3 recommended tablets each day. for general health, depression,heart, mind etc.- grape seed extract - 150 mg daily - i take this as an anti oxidant and for my hair.- gingko biloba - 240 mg daily - ii take this for my add, better concentration and memory.now from what i know, all three are blood thinners. taking them and taking maybe an aspirin for a head ache can be harmful from what i read. furthermore, i've read some horror stories about people who have needed emergency surgery but they were not able to because they will not be able to stop the bleeding due to the anti clotting effect of these supplements.furthermore, i plan to take these supplements indefinitely, but it worries me of the long term effects of taking them. but then i think they are giving me better quality of life especially how good gingko is for cognitive function. i don't know what to do, please give me some advice.
3255,i have two sons one 51/2 and the other is almost 4. they both have sucked their thumbs since they were babies, but i can't get them to stop. they used to do it when they were just tired or scared, but now they do it all the time. i am always seeing them with it in their mouths. i just don't know what to do to stop it. any advice would be extremely helpful.brandy

3268,dear doctor,i have unexplained infertilty. i had 4 times hormone stimulated iui. 2 times (75 ie gonal f) which resulted in 1 mature follicle of 18 mm. also 2 times(100 and 112,5 ie puregon) without insemination, because of premature ovulation at 15 and 17 mm follicle (too small).my doctor says that if the follicles are too small and burst too early, they are of insufficient quality.can cetrotide prevent this too early ovulation? can cetrotide help to develop the follicle in growth/quality and prevent this? my doctor says that cetrotide cannot prevent a bad quality follicle from early ovulation and if it does, the follicle is not mature and has bad quality. i would like to hear your comments on this topic.isn't this what you do in ivf? cetrotide to prevent early ovulation and let the follicles grow until they reach 18-20 mm and good quality? what do you think should be my next step?
3269,i have this dizzy spell esp.when im flat on my bed and when i turn my head .i fell on my bed when i got up from bed at one point.this has been going on since last month after i stopped taking my bcp.my preg test were all negative even the blood.please help!
3270,i was 5 days late for my period, and i have not been feeling like i am about to start my period. i have been having sore breast, nausea, tired (lots of naps),no appetite, just feeling fat. i have been feeling yucky and not myself. i took a couple of pregnancy test and they have all been negative. i finally started something of a period. had brown discharge yesterday but it was mainly nothing, and today i have a little discharge and a little pink, but nothing like a normal period for me.can i be pregnant? do you think i should contact my doctor since i have not been feeling normal?
3271,i'm 18 years old and i'm tired every second of every day. even if i sleep for 12 hours i'll still feel weak and really tired the next day. this has been going on for 2 years now. i've been to the doctors and had a blood test and i found out i'm very low on iron. i've been taking 3 iron tablets a day for the last 4 months and theres still no change. i've tried eating foods rich in iron such as red meat as well. i know it sounds stupid but i feel like theres something else wrong with me. its ruining my life because i can no longer spend as much time with my friends and i'm usually in bed by 7! i need some help but i don't know what other tests the doctor can offer. please help!

3273,my 7 year old daughter has consistently been wetting her pants for the past 5 months.    we have had an extremely difficult time potty training her.     my husand and i work splite shifts, our potty training techniques were different.    she had no consistency.    she went to all day kindergarten, had some accidents, hit and miss.    but we never totally got rid of them.    she doesn't want to stop what it is she is doing to go to the bathroom.    this school year - 1st grade - has been exceptionally worse.    the first few months were not steady.    now the days that are dry are easy to count, because there are so few of them.    she is mostly dry during the day but in the evenings, when i am home she 99% of time will wet her pants.    we have tried everything.    stickers each dry day, that didn't work.    her teacher was even nice enough to offer her a prize when we said she had a successful goal period.    she was allowed to do that once.    we then moved on to her giving us a favorite toy of hers to keep when she has an accident.    that didn't work well. i will admit that my anger over this issue is getting bad.    now her dad - who is the most patient person i know - is even getting frustrated.    she is not wetting the bed.    the only thing that has changed since january is that we got a new puppy.    she loves the puppy!!    oh and she turned 7 in march.    she cannot stand her birthday, she tells me that she doesn't want to acknowledge her birthday, she doesn't want to get older.    she has told me also, when we are playing and i say wait, i have to go to that bathroom.    she will say oh mommy just ignore it and it will go away.she will never tell us or her teacher when she has wet herself.    never.is this just our child or are we doin something wrong.
3274,about 15 years ago i had lasik surgery that gave me monovision with one eye for distance and one for reading.    i was very happy with the result.    i only needed glasses for reading in dim light or very small print.    over time my near vision deteriorated and i now use reading glasses for extensive reading.    i read a lot and also use the computer for several hours a day.    now i have cataracts and need surgery.    my doctor recommended crystalens lenses or toric lenses. is this the best way to restore my monovision?    i would prefer not to use glasses at all after the surgery.
3275,my child    likes one    musical group    and he    wants to watch them    the whole day,    we don't let him, but    *he is    2 years    old* also he has a brochure and a flyier of them,    he     wants    to    be holding in his hands the whole    day this two things    even when    he goes to bed.    do you consider this is an obssesibe compulsory behavior__
3276,i had a hysterectomy with removal of both tubes and ovaries 7 months ago.    it was done laparoscopically/vaginally.    2 weeks postop i hemorrhaged due to a pelvic hematoma and was rehospitalized.    that pain was incredible.    since then, i have had shooting pain down the low back, buttocks and down both legs; sometimes causing my right leg to buckle.    at times, the pain will shoot up into my right side and arm even with stretching or leaning forward.    i saw a neurologist who has started me on gabapentin which helps somewhat, but doesn't find or fix the cause.    as well, in my research on gabapentin, i see a possible link to pancreatic cancer and am quite startled as i am an 11-year breast cancer survivor.    any thoughts on the cause of this nerve pain considering the length of the time it has remained?

3283,i started puberty quite early and it has just occured to me that i only had have only had wet dreams in the early stages of puberty and for about the last year or two i haven't had a wet dream, i can usually ejaculate when wanking, not nessecarily the most powerful ejaculations i have ever had but still an ejaculation, but even if i think about stuff sexually stimulating i will usually get erect, but the fact i'm not having wet dreams concers me, could this indicate a problem down below or when it comes to sex?

3285,i have been trying to get pregnant for awhile now and it just is not happening i never had a problem getting pregnant with my first child.    can anyone give me some advice
3286,hi, i have had this strange rubbing twitch feeling on the lower right side of my stomach for a few months now.. and i cant seem to shake it. i dont know what is causing it. i have two young children, i dont believe im pregnant ive been having my periods regularly and im on birth control and i take it religiously. i dont seem to understand why i have this feeling. and the movement going on.. seems to feel like theres something in there.. but i know i cant be pregnant. i took a pregnancy test a few months back because i was feeling super nauseas every day when i woke up for a couple weeks.. but all the tests said negative and ive still had my period normally.. someone help!
3287,my last period came 10 days late - i thought i was pregnant (nausea, very sore breasts, emotional, just 'felt' pregnant) but the tests were negative. but then i started spotting for 2 days, then i had extremely heavy (gushing) period for three days - extremely painful (my periods are often quite sore, but not that sore, and not that heavy).my period seemed to stop for a few days but then i started spotting again. the spotting gradually increased and i had some very bad pains which (at first) i thought were early ovulation pains (at this point i was at 'day 10' of my cycle). but the pains have lasted a week now - they come and go - sometimes it's like really bad period cramps (doubled over in pain) sometimes it's a tight/stabbing feeling on my left side. the spotting has now increased to being like a dripping tap. so right now, i am at 'day 18' of my cycle.before now, my periods were very regular and always 28 days apart - would always last 5 days. i have had a copper iud for 1 year with no problems. i would appreciate any feedback... thanks so much :-)
3288,my 6 month old just started sleeping on her tummy and is having nightmares?    she screams and kicks a handful of times throughout the night with out opening her eyes i just give her a pacifier and she turns her head right back to sleep.    also she is sleeping on her tummy suddenly.    should i be especially worried???
3289,i am a 37 year old female who has a long history with severe pelvic pain associated with my period.    i have had a lot of doctors check out my situation and all tests come back as normal.    at one point about 7 years ago it was suggested i have a hysterectomy as it seems no answers can be found.    recently i have made several trips to the er in a final attempt to figure out why i have so much pain.    again, all lab work and ultrasounds have come back as normal.    i find this hard to believe as for one, my cervix has been described as severely tilted up and to the right (to the point some doctors have a very difficult time finding it during exams) and 2, the pain is so severe i can be down for up to 2 weeks at a time.    something has to be causing this.    if i had someone tell me what was actually wrong and that a hysterectomy was my only option, i would do it in a flash.    but i don't want to go through with such a radical surgery if there might be other options.    the only diagnosis i can seem to get is menorrahgia, and all hormone therapies have only helped my heavy flow issues, not the pain.    i have no children and have only been pregnant once, which was ectopic and resulted in the removal of one tube when i was 19.    a recent pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound stated there were no significant cystic or solid masses, but did state, a few tiny follicular cysts were noted bilaterally.    if anyone has any suggestions i would be grateful to hear them.    living on percocet at least one week out of every month is not how i want to continue my life.
3290,so this is my 3rd time on clomid, and they just doubled the dose to 100mg.    i was at what i think could be 2 dpo, and just after my dh and i bd, i ruptured a cyst.    i knew it right away, because this has happened 4 times before in my life.    turns out i have 2 cysts, and of course, i can't see my doc til tomorrow (this happened sunday night), but my question is - is this month on clomid shot?    even with the cysts, could i have ovulated properly and possibly still get pregnant?    i don't have very high expectations :o(
3291,age 38 years working on computer since 1993 daily 8 hours, suffering with shadowed vision with my left eye and blurred vision with my right eye. my family is having glaucoma.please help me, what are the reason(s) and how is its cure?
3292,i have issues with a sore penis. the soreness occurs when i get an erection after i ejaculate, whether i ejaculate from sexual intercourse, oral sex or masturbation. this soreness typically lasts 3 or 4 days, but the pain returns once i ejaculate again at which point my next erection will be even more sore. the soreness is not completely unbearable as i am able to have have sex and ejaculate again. lately, i've noticed that after a long erection sometimes when i receive the next erection i get the same pain in my penis as i normally get after ejaculating. the pain does not exist when my penis is flaccid. please provide any advice that you can.
3293,i have been ovulating for the last 16 cycles. but my dr said she wants me to try clomid in june if i don't get pregnant on my own.i'm lost why clomid if i ovulate already? she wanted me to try clomid like 6 months ago but i choose to try to lose more weight first.i do have pcos which seems to be under control with walking 20 mins a day and metformin.thanks ladies

3296,hi dr, i have a nephew who is 8 weeks old.    since he was born he has had spurts of crying fits w/ his body stretching out & fists going.    the only way to sooth him would be shaking him lightly, once you stop that, he goes back into his fits.    this is not an all day thing, only about an hour or two all day.    he does have problems with    bowel movements.    any advice would be appreciated.thank youmichelle

3300,hello, on november 2nd i had my iud takin out. on the 5th i had unprotected sex, the next day i took next choice pills. ever since then i've been having lower stomach pain almost like a knot at the bottom on my abdomen. also been cranky, hungrier than usual and having lower back pain. this was 10 days ago. i'm supposed to have my period on the 24th. i know it says it can come early or late.. should i be worried?
3301,i got involved with a new partner almost a month ago. last week i got sick with a flu, and once the flew blew over i had a bump inside of my labia major. i went to the doctor, he said it wasn't herpes, but i did have a uti and bv. however, the rash got worse and i had to go back. the bumps would form rings/craters and then turn into what looks definitely like a cold sore, raised edges and white in the middle. now they look like they're healing, i can't tell, but the edges are sinking down and they're still white. they don't hurt or burn, only a bit if i brush up against them or pee. i had a tiny bit of itching at night when another one appeared very close to the inside of my vagina. i also have very, very swollen lymph nodes in my groin area, i've never felt them that swollen before. on my next doctors visit, one doctor told me it really didnt look like herpes, another says that it is. there were swabs taken and i can't find out for sure until another week. for now, i'd like to hear if anyone else has experienced it or is familiar with it, what else it could be? i've looked at pictures of herpes, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't itch, and they are clear enough that i can easily count how many of the sores i have. in the case that it is herpes, i did notify my partner about what is going on, we're both extremely scared. any advice is appreciated.
3302,i know most of you know my story so i won't make you listen to it again...i had a d and c on june 19th and still no af.    i went to the re on mon.    he did an internal sonogram and took blood.    my hcg levels are still 18.    he called me today to talk to me about my blood work but i missed his call.. he wants me to call him tomorrow.    is it possible to have some tissue left from my d and c...wouldn't he have seen this on the internal sonogram...sorry to bother everyone but i am driving myself crazy...thanks for the info.

3311,i was supposed to start a new pack of pills i am on (mirelle) i had unprotected sex on a wednesday, the day i forgot my new pack at work, i was spotting that day, my period started on the thursday, can i be pregnant? must i continue with my pills on friday and discard the ones for wednesday and thursday?
3312,about 4 years ago i slipped and fell running up my walk way and slammed my head into the cement. a couple years before that i fell out of the shower and hit my head on the toilet. i had been getting a lot of headaches after that but i never told anyone becuase i was afraid something would be wrong. i haven't had any really bad headaches like that up until a couple months ago. i don't know whether its a    brain tumor or something? i probally should have gotten my head checked when i fell the first time. should i be worried or is it just a normal thing?
3313,what kind of animal owns you?we are owned by venus. she is a big, fat main coon. we're going to be adding another sister in for her and the boys, we're getting a german shepherd pup within the next few months (probably around christmas). so we're excited and nervous to see how she handles that.... : o)
3314,i seperated with my wife in mid november last year. i do not blame her for leaving me because for 1 reason or another i didn't fulfill my duties to her as a husband. we both admited our errors and we want to get back together as soon as we get little financialy stable. she is 23 and i am 28. we have a 20 month old baby.however, her family, where she lives now, found out about our plans and made some strict rules. they do not allow her to speak to me alone, not even regarding the baby. we used to talk up to 10 times a day and even went out but now she writes me a text message every day or 2.she admited that her family is opressing her but she cannot do nothing about it at the moment. in her culture, parents must be obeyed. however i see no reason my marriage should die and my son to grow with 1 parent only. i love her and she loves her but we cannot get back together immediately due to financial reasons. her family has no right to do this.going to police wouldn't help because my wife wouldn't admit the abuse, partly out of fear and partly because she loves them.i wander what can i do. my wife says to be patient and things will work out but i do not see it that way since her family doesn't even talk to me. i feel hopeless and helpless. my plan is to stick with our deal and save some money and get back together but im worried if they convince her or brainwash her to forget me.if i tell them they should stop doing that then they might even make her stop talking to me completely.any advices?ps. we didn't go through court, we made a deal regarding the baby and agreed to have it signed eventually.

3319,i was wondering what was normal for cm before af.my breast started hurting a week or so ago, which means if i am not pregnant af should show up within the next 5-7 days...because my breast usually hurt for 12-14 days before af every month.but yesterday, i got some thick and odorless cm (not ovulation cm, and it is not normal for my breast to hurt before i ovulate anyways), it was the kind i got last time i was pregnant, but i cannot remember if i had it before my period was supposed to come or not. (and so and i have not been bding in four days because i am exhausted! so it cannot be for that either).so i was wondering if this is a possible sign for pregnancy?xoxo thank you thank you! crossing my fingers :)
3320,i had my third child in january 06 by c section.    my first 2 were natural.    since my c section, i have wondered if i am put back together properly.    the top of my stomach is still large and tender, and feels knotty.    my incision is fine, i had no problems recovering.    was just wondering if this is normal.    if it is, what are the best excercises to tone those muscles back up.    even though it was over 3 years ago, i've put on 45 pounds and people still ask when i am due.    i'm still young (31) and want to look my age.    thanks everyone.nicole
3321,so ladies, doc just called with husbands results from the second analysis (done at a different office).    this is the sample that was used for the iui.    last time the count was about 65 million, this time it was just over 20 million, but she said it can vary quite a bit with each one (there were 7.7 mill after the wash, is this good?.........) the motility was 59%, which is up 9% from the last time. the morphology was 3% last time (the reason for doing the iui so they could be washed), and this time it was 5%, so their shapes increased by about 2%.... so i have hope.    i made it through the first week, have 1 more week and a day or so before the beta. please continue to pray!!

3325,i was in a long relationship, i broke uo with my boyfriend of five years because he was so possessive of me and there was just no chemistry at all. he kept complaining about how we wern't sexually active anymore and i just got tired of his nagging also, so i left him. i saw about two or three guys after that, one was unfaithful, another was married then the last one seemed to be perfect but then i found out that he is ridiculously busy, runs about 4 or 5 businesses. he's always so busy! the 5yrs ex, wants me back, i dont want him back. the married guy wants to make me a second wife, i'm uncomfortable with that too bt i think i like him and the businessman cannot commit, he just wants to have fun, i dont want that because i'm scared it will end up hurting me...please doctor, i need your help, what can you suggest for me. i feel i dont want either one of them & and i want any man ever again, is that possible?
3326,today was my first retrieval for ivf. i am 30 years old and we saw at least 12 follicles but only retrieved 4 eggs! i am very disappointed. we can't afford to try again if we need to since infertility treatments are not covered by my insurance. i hope and pray that they all make it to fertilization and transfer. any thoughts on why we only got 4 when there were 12 follicles? any success stories with ivf on the first try?
3327,hi all:    i took 100 mg clomid this month (doc prescribed) and actually produced 8 follicles at least, we saw them with ultrasound.    on cd 26 i had a big bleed, heavy in the morning, full of clots, ended that night, dark red.    hpt showed a strong positive (i took hpt because i had a hunch).    cd 27 had quant hcg of 14,500, cd 29 had hcg of 13,500.    ultrasound showed a gestational sack measuring large with no heartbeat (but come on!    i should only be 4 weeks!).    i think the tech was an idiot but that's another story.    us also showed alot of ovarian cycts and enlargment of the ovaries (ok- the clomid worked way too well for me so we will not repeat again). doc told me i will miscarry because hcg declined.    i have no symptons, no carmps and no bleeding.    i have preg sympsons of sore boobs and a little nausea.    my questions is 3 fold, (1) i think the big bleed cd 26 was probably a result of the ovarian hyperstimulation and the cycts must have been bleeding, (2) can an hcg that high (3x the level where i should be) maybe have dropped as i might have fertilized multiples and some are not taking, (3) if there is a gestational sac at 4 weeks maybe it's a little big but we should not see anything in it yet?    anybody out there with anything like this story with a happy ending??    my lmp was 12/4.    thanks for any feedback ;)
3328,i went to the doc 2day and they found out i have a blood clot between my uterus and menbrane. i never had any bleeding or cramping at all. the doc told me that if i do bleed or feel any cramping to go to the er right away. they told me thats its very small and i shouldnt worry myself, but now im scared because i dont want to have a miscarriage. im gonna try to not think of it but its very hard to not. my baby is doing good. i seend the heartbeat and everything. all my blood work is fine. so i have 2 go back oct. 2 for another ultrasound to make sure the blood clot didnt increase. the doc told me that it will dissolve on its own. i hope everything is ok
3329,hi, my period is every 35-37 days.    i have been trying to conceive for a few months now and had sex just around my ovulation time this month.    my period are due this w-end sat 22/10/11 but i took a 2 day bleed on fri night 14/10/11.    i initially thought this was implantation bleeding as it was around this time, i had cramping and had sore boobs for 9 days total, leading up and until the sunday that i stopped bleeding.    the bleeding was a bit heavy compared to what people say implantation bleeding is.    i am now having lower back pains for the past 2 days and having to take painkillers for this.    i did take a preg test on the friday before the heavier bleed kicked in which was neg but was this too early??    anyways, does anyone think i may be pregnant but just tested too early?

3332,my 3 year old son has recently started laughing whenever he gets in trouble, and it so frustrating!    he'll do something like run outside and try to get in the neighbor's gate, and i'll come to get him and he'll just be giggling. he'll keep laughing as i put him in time-out; it's this maniacal, taunting laugh that makes me so upset and i have to struggle not to lose my temper.    is anyone else dealing with this? i'm sure he thinks he's being funny and playing a game, but i can't get him to be serious and realize that he could've gotten really hurt or lost, and how upset i am.    i'm hoping it's a phase, because it makes me feel like a silly ineffectual mom when every punishment is met with this laughing.    any advice, please?
3333,hi. i am mother to a five year old g/d girl named madison. at day 9, the dr. office called me and told me to immediately stop all nursing and milk formula, to go to the health dept., that they were opening a special sat. clinic just for her, and to report to the outpatient lab at the hospital as soon as they opened on that monday. needless to say, i was scared out of my wits. she was dxed with d/g with a level that i can't recall. i know the number is not supposed to ever go down, but i can't help noticing that she has issues that sound alot like cg.    madison has a speech delay, developmental delays, possibly an autisim spectrum disorder pdd, and vision problems. i can't help but wonder if despite the experts saying that they will not have any issues, if all of this is related. perhaps it's just a coincidence but i am having her levels tested again anyway. i do remember that she was at the 5% levels at one year. anyone else feel this way or have children with delays?
3334,i live in slc, utahabout four years ago i attended a clinic with b-12 shots under a doctors care, they also provided perscription diet pills and they checked body fat with a computer, their office sold protien products ect.    i recently went to the location and they were gone, i cant rember the name it was something like weight loss clinic and the phone advertisment had a cute fat lady, it was in the phone book.    has anybody any information on this?    thanks
3335,one last question.... for as long as i can remember (i am 29 yrs old), my pupils have always been extremely large and look just like most peoples eyes look after having them dilated for an eye exam.    is there a medically known reason for this?    it's annoying because sometimes i think people may think i'm on drugs since my pupils are so huge all the time!    i do have adhd, but i haven't ever read that this is a symptom related to adhd (other than a side effect of stimulant medication which i don't take).    thanks.
3336,so in this day and age we have so much at our finger tips regarding information out in cyber space.    my question is . . .    before you go on a date with someone or went on a date with someone, did you google that person?and if you are 'old' like me and married a while, do you wish you could have done this back while you were dating?
3337,i have recently quit smoking and been diagnosed with rosacea . i am currently taking doxylin every morning for the rosacea. i have however been noticing an increase in sudden spasm of pain as i lift things shooting trough my arms and my limbs have started to ache and feel swollen every day , all day . as a result i am definatly less agile and feel less upto taking on physical projects . can this be a result from doxylin or is it just that i m getting older? (i m 29 )
3338,over christmas of 2006, my aunt fell ill and is in a nursing home. i was awarded custody of her (then 4 y/o) boy. from the beginning it became evident that he had a seriuos touching problem. he has his hands on his private part oh i'd say anywhere from 30-60 times per day. i took him to the pediatrition he said there is nothing wrong.i have asked several dozen parents of boys if any of their children exhibited this behaviour, everyone has said no. we have tried talking to him telling him this is not appropriate behaviour in public places, we have tried smacking his hand to make him aware of how many times he does it, and we have even tried the scare tactic that (if he doesnt stop it will fall off). nothing slows this down at all.i have asked other family members and this was a problem long before the emotional turnover and changes that occured.any suggestions?thanks!
3339,ive noticed on my right eye ball on the white part on both sides of the iris the area is soft/squishy & theres a little lump like as if its swollen there or something.. what could be the reason for this? a couple of weeks ago i was swiming & my brother splashed a ton of water into my eyes & i felt a big amount of pressure in my eye under my eyelids & it hurt.. could this be part of the cause? i dont have money to go see an eye doctor so what should i do?
3340,hello,i went to my doctor this past tuesday morning and he told me i needed surgery for my right eye the same day.    i had a retina detachment.    he said that i caught it in time before it hit the center of my eye.    i was in shock to say the least.    my parents just left for their vacation that morning for a 2-week cruise.    they wanted to cancel their trip and come home to me, but i told them no.    thank god, my friend terry was there to go with me to get the surgery.    they told me that they put in a belt into my eye and gave me the gas bubble.    it's only been two days since my surgery and trying to look through my eye is quite difficult.    the gas bubble is effecting my balance and actually making me quite nauseous.    is this normal?    i'm only 41 years old and they said i should recover quite quickly.    i am doing my drops and pain medications as prescribed, but i am keeping the patch on my eye all the time because i am actually afraid to take it off except to put in my drops and change the patch.    when should i remove the patch?    i thank you for any support and answers to my questions.
3341,dow  s plunge could affect financial reform billboth parties seek to capitalize on anxiety generated by historic dropspecial reportwashington - the stomach-churning fear about wall street's turbulence is roaring back.europe's spreading debt crisis, fraud charges against goldman sachs and a 1,000 point nose dive in the dow jones industrials are turning up the heat on congress to get the nation's financial house under control.if it continues, the stock market's dizzying plunge could threaten the fragile recovery even as other economic indicators    including the biggest monthly gain in employment in four years    suggest the u.s. is rebounding faster than its european trading partners.investors appeared to be looking beyond the improving economic data to focus on vivid images of riots in greece, floods in the south, the oil spill in the gulf of mexico and the times square bombing attempt.there's already deep public hostility toward wall street institutions, so the dow's extreme volatility seemed likely to work to the advantage of the backers of the senate's financial regulation overhaul bill.the meltdown was cited by supporters as one more reason to tighten lightly regulated high-speed computerized trading practices. both parties are angling to harness the anger toward wall street bailouts and bonuses for political gain in the fall elections.a robust stock market is key to the recovery. it's vital to keeping high-income households spending. it's key to business that have started to hire again, said mark zandi of moody's economy.com.business leaders are taking a signal from their stock price. if their stock prices fall, they're not going to hire. the recovery's going to be short circuited, said zandi, a one-time adviser to gop presidential nominee sen. john mccain who now counsels congressional democrats.this volatility is not good for anybody and i think it's very important for someone to try to figure it out, he said.it didn't take long for politicians to jump into the fray.president barack obama said regulators were looking into thursday's market panic with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again.while the senate legislation, an obama priority, does not now address stock trading issues, attempts are under way to change that.sens. ted kaufman, d-del., and mark warner, d-va., proposed requiring the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission to scrutinize high-frequency trading and other computerized strategies that move buy and sell orders at blinding speeds    practices that may have contributed to thursday's snowballing sell-off.rep. paul kanjorski, d-pa., scheduled a tuesday hearing of the house financial services subcommittee that he leads. we cannot allow a technological error to spook the markets and cause panic, he said.investors got an unmistakable reminder of how quickly their fortunes can change on thursday when the dow took a short but unprecedented 1,000-point tailspin. the sudden drop    generally believed to be due to trader error and computer glitches    sent the stocks of several companies briefly to almost zero.the dow partially rebounded to finish the day down 347 points, or 3.2 percent. but turbulence continued on friday, with the dow falling nearly 280 points at one point before ending the day with a 140-point drop.the losses came despite friday's strong u.s. jobs april report, approval by greek lawmakers of drastic austerity cuts needed for international rescue loans worth $140 billion and approval of the package by both houses of the parliament in germany, where bailing out greece is unpopular.a greek default could be dire. greece's troubles already have dealt a blow to the euro and could result in far higher borrowing costs for other indebted european countries. the crisis eventually could cross the atlantic to the united states, which is facing its own debt and borrowing problems that in some ways resemble greece's.the u.s. stock sell-off, coupled with the government's civil fraud charges against the investment bank goldman sachs, should help build momentum for the regulation bill and hand obama another legislative victory to follow health care overhaul, said american university political scientist james thurber.it sets even more of an environment to get the thing through, thurber said. it triggers oversight hearings and concern about unregulated off-wall street trading institutions and computerized trading.stock trading increasingly has become dependent on computers that process trades automatically, speeding the flow of buy and sell orders, often on new electronic exchanges far removed from trading floors. what is known as high frequency trading    rapid automated buying and selling    now accounts for more than half of daily trading volume.it was not clear whether the market's jitters would calm with the release of more good economic news    or threaten to plunge the economy into a double-dip recession with a return of the rout that drove stocks down to bargain basement levels in 2008 and early 2009.
3342,i have been fatigued, nauseous, and dizzy for 5 days straight.    i am also experiencing severe hot flashes and diarrhea.
3343,hi,i am a father of a 4 yr 2 month old girl, who is our only child.    we are having difficulties with our daughter ability to comprehend     for instance, she repeats questions back to me instead of answering them.    for instance, i say hi xxxx how was your day?, she repeats the same question exactly back to me, or xxxx don't don't that knife, she will say dont touch that knife.    she does know answers to some basic questions like what color is that house, she will say the correct color, ir what is daddy's name, she gives correct answer..she is very bright, she know her numbers    to 100. can read and speak english and chinese,    though i don't know if she truly understands what she is reading or just memorizing words.other issues, she gets excited playing with kids at the playground and sometimes grabs them and pushes them down, causing them to cry, she doesn't do it maliciously, and goes over and helps them up, but i am worried she may hurt another kid.    we have tried to tell her not to touch other kids, and she responds with don't touch other kids, but does it anyway ..we have scheduled an assessment at our county shool system to get her evaluated but that wont be for a few weeks.    any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
3344,so. a while back i had become intensly good friends with this guy. he was my best best best friend. the guy i could stay up till all hours of the morning talking about everything and nothing with.the connection was intense and wonderful. we had decided to start sleeping with each other as long as it didn't effect our friendship,and it didn't. slowly but surely we started to fall for each other and after months and months of discussion, decided to date. at first it worked so well,the friendship that meshed with the romance was a lovely combination. but as of late its felt like the friendship aspect has dwindeld...and is replaced by what i assumed where comfortable scilences.but the more often they happen the more i can feel the scilence becoming ...too aparent. the conversation has become shorter and more surface level,the deep discussions seem forced.we care and love each other,and breaking up seems rash. i'm just looking for a way to get the conversation back and flowing.i want my best friend back,yet i want the love there too...any ideas?

3346,me and my boyfriend have been sexual active and he went(nutted) inside of me but not all the way what is are the chance of me seal being pregnant?
3347,my son is 4. he will turn 5 in september. i am very concerned because he is having major anger outbursts lately. he recently finished preschool and is now not attending for the summer. his schedule was very rigid before june. now, he basically has no schedule. anger outbursts include screaming, spitting, hitting objects, throwing things, and very recently, hitting people (including me). i would have called these outbursts tantrums before this summer. now, they seem a little more intense than a tantrum. i'm wondering if the lack of schedule could possibly be affecting his mood/behavior. he typically has an outburs when something doesn't go his way; such as having to stop playing a game so he can come to eat supper, having to stop watching tv to go run errands, having to leave his friends when it's time to go home, etc. i have tried time outs, taking privileges, sending him to his room for an extended cool down time... none of these seem to be helping very much. i am concerned that he will be starting school in the fall. i do not want these behaviors to happen at school. right now, he does not care where he is when he has an outburst: public places or at home. it does not bother him. i would really like some advice as to how to proceed. is it time for me to seek a doctor's help?
3348,would it be safe to ride a motorcycle after having corneal transplant, if yes, about how long do i have to wait to do so. and how long do i have to wait to get rid of the shield at night. is only six weeks since i had my surgery.
3349,hello, i was wondering if anyone can help me....5 years ago, i had a small stomach virus, in which i only vomited twice. now, before that, i had always been worried about it, and freaking out if anyone felt sick/vomited, but never really though about it besides that. but after getting sick myself, i found the nausea still remained...i was afraid to eat anything and was to the point of tears nearly every night at wondering why this wouldn't leave. i lost nearly 30 lbs in a month or so, and though i've gotten over the eating thing, the nausea has been with me almost every single day for 5 years...i had an allergy test done, an endoscopy, radiation testing, etc, but nothing was physically wrong with me. i also had begun to notice that the nausea feeling was in my throat, not in my stomach as normal nausea is.    so i knew that i wasn't probably going to throw up, but still that fear of it remains...so it began to label itself as a phobia, and i understood that, because i began to use hand santizer every 5 minutes, i would back away immediately if someone said they were feeling sick, and would come back if they answered that it was only a cold kind of sick. if people in movies threw up, i turned away and felt nauseous immediately. i even ran out of the room, crying, when my dad burped, but it seemed like he was going to throw up that it freaked me out. i began planning my every move, from sitting in front of classes or the end seats of movie theaters for easy escape, wondering if i should take a trash bag with me and always making sure that my 'nausea relief,' promethazine, was always with me. it's the only thing that took that feeling away, but made me completely drowsy to the point of full on falling asleep in class. i stopped taking that a year or two ago, because of the drowsiness, but i always had to have it with me, just in case. i switched it to a syrup form sold in walgreens, etc about a year ago, and it really helps, but now i can't take it because of the sugar, which interferes with a new diet i'm on. it always made me feel worse though, before feeling better, so i was confused...and sometimes it would go away for a time, which was amazing, but it'd always come back, and hit me full on. i remember feeling fine, laughing uncontrollably with my friend over the webcam once, when it suddenly hit me, but the real nausea. i freaked out, thinking i was really going to barf, and that's the most extreme case, but it fluctuates...i've seen psychologists and psychiatrists, an ear nose and throat specialist, an eye doctor, everything, and nothing has helped. i've tried nexium for if it was just heartburn, and paxil and other generic brands, but nothing has helped.the psychiatrist has told me i have mild anxiety issues, but nothing seems to help, ever, and i'm writing to see if anyone out there has an answer, or a sliver of hope, for either removal of this nausea feeling, or even has a cure for the anxiety, so i don't have to continue planning where the exits and trashcans are, just in case.anyone, please help?
3350,i have the taste of blood when i wake up in the morning, i also pass wind around 40 to 50 times a day and always stinks, i burb a lot aswell what could it be?
3351,newsmax.combreaking from newsmax.comsen. joe lieberman tells newsmax that he will probably seek re-election in 2012 and will likely run again as an independent.newsmax chief washington correspondent ronald kessler asked the senator, who lost the democratic primary in 2006 and was elected as an independent in the general election, if he could see himself running as a republican.editor's notes:* the biggest fraud in medicine today. avoid becoming the next victim.* become a secret millionaire, your neighbors won't even know!  i  ve been a democrat all my life. i got rejected by the democratic party in 2006 and went on as an independent, and thank god and the people of connecticut, i got re-elected,   lieberman responds.  so i  m up again in 2012. i probably will run again. i  ve got to make that decision by the end of this year, i would say. you know, it  s possible. i haven  t decided what banner i would like to run under. probably independent is the one that suits me best, because that  s what i am.  in this very partisan time, it  s not my nature or my philosophy to just walk down one party road whether i think it  s right or not. i  m going to, like a lot of americans, decide what makes the most sense on issue to issue and do what i think is right.  so right now i  d probably be more inclined to run again as an independent. but anything is possible.

3353,while i was packing my vagina started to hurt so i went to check it    and i have this painful lump in my vagina (more like on the labia).    so i went on webmd.com and used their symptom checker and find out that it was an abscess. so i went to sleep and when i woke up the pain of the lump is no longer painful not even if i touch it. does that mean it is getting better? or could it be something more serious?
3354,http://www.naturalnews.com/032048_radiation_milk.html4/11/11(naturalnews) the us environmental protection agency (epa) continues to release new data showing that various milk and water supply samples from across the us are testing increasingly high for radioactive elements such as iodine-131, cesium-134, and cesium-137, all of which are being emitted from the ongoing fukushima daiichia nuclear fallout. as of april 10, 2011, 23 us water supplies have tested positive for radioactive iodine-131 (http://opendata.socrata.com/w/4ig7-...), and worst of all, milk samples from at least three us locations have tested positive for iodine-131 at levels exceeding epa maximum containment levels (mcl) (http://opendata.socrata.com/w/pkfj-...).as far as the water supplies are concerned, it is important to note that the epa is only testing for radioactive iodine-131. there are no readings or data available for cesium, uranium, or plutonium -- all of which are being continuously emitted from fukushima, as far as we know -- even though these elements are all much more deadly than iodine-131. even so, the following water supplies have thus far tested positive for iodine-131, with the dates they were collected in parenthesis to the right:los angeles, calif. - 0.39 pci/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (baxter), penn. - 0.46 pci/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (belmont), penn. - 1.3 pci/l (4/4/11)philadelphia (queen), penn. - 2.2 pci/l (4/4/11)muscle shoals, al. - 0.16 pci/l (3/31/11)niagara falls, ny - 0.14 pci/l (3/31/11)denver, colo. - 0.17 pci/l (3/31/11)detroit, mich. - 0.28 pci/l (3/31/11)east liverpool, oh. - 0.42 pci/l (3/30/11)trenton, nj - 0.38 pci/l (3/29/11)painesville, oh. - 0.43 pci/l (3/29/11)columbia, penn. - 0.20 pci/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (4442), tenn. - 0.28 pci/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (772), tenn. - 0.20 pci/l (3/29/11)oak ridge (360), tenn. - 0.18 pci/l (3/29/11)helena, mont. - 0.18 pci/l (3/28/11)waretown, nj - 0.38 pci/l (3/28/11)cincinnati, oh. - 0.13 pci/l (3/28/11)pittsburgh, penn. - 0.36 pci/l (3/28/11)oak ridge (371), tenn. - 0.63 pci/l (3/28/11)chattanooga, tenn. - 1.6 pci/l (3/28/11)boise, id. - 0.2 pci/l (3/28/11)richland, wash. - 0.23 pci/l (3/28/11)again, these figures do not include the other radioactive elements being spread by fukushima, so there is no telling what the actual cumulative radiation levels really were in these samples. the figures were also taken two weeks ago, and were only just recently reported. if current samples were taken at even more cities, and if the tests conducted included the many other radioactive elements besides iodine-131, actual contamination levels would likely be frighteningly higher.but in typical government fashion, the epa still insists that everything is just fine, even though an increasing amount of us water supplies are turning up positive for even just the radioactive elements for which the agency is testing -- and these levels seem to be increasing as a direct result of the situation at the fukushima plant, which continues to worsen with no end in sight (http://www.naturalnews.com/032035_f...).water may be the least of our problems, however. new epa data just released on sunday shows that at least three different milk samples -- all from different parts of the us -- have tested positive for radioactive iodine-131 at levels that exceed the epa maximum thresholds for safety, which is currently set at 3.0 pico curies per liter (pci/l).in phoenix, ariz., a milk sample taken on march 28, 2011, tested at 3.2 pci/l. in little rock, ark., a milk sample taken on march 30, 2011, tested at 8.9 pci/l, which is almost three times the epa limit. and in hilo, hawaii, a milk sample collected on april 4, 2011, tested at 18 pci/l, a level six times the epa maximum safety threshold. the same hawaii sample also tested at 19 pci/l for cesium-137, which has a half life of 30 years (http://www.naturalnews.com/031992_r...), and a shocking 24 pci/l for cesium-134, which has a half life of just over two years (http://opendata.socrata.com/w/pkfj-...).why is this milk contamination significant? milk, of course, typically represents the overall condition of the food chain because cows consume grass and are exposed to the same elements as food crops and water supplies. in other words, when cows' milk starts testing positive for high levels of radioactive elements, this is indicative of radioactive contamination of the entire food supply.and even with the milk samples, the epa insanely says not to worry as its 3.0 pci/l threshold is allegedly only for long-term exposure. but the sad fact of the matter is that the fukushima situation is already a long-term situation. not only does it appear that the fukushima reactor cores are continuing to melt, since conditions at the plant have not gotten any better since the earthquake and tsunami, but many of the radioactive elements that have already been released in previous weeks have long half lives, and have spread halfway around the world.the other problem with the epa's empty reassurances that radiation levels are too low to have a negative impact on humans is the fact that the agency does not even have an accurate grasp on the actual aggregate exposure to radiation from all sources (water, food, air, rain, etc.). when you combine perpetual exposure from multiple sources with just the figures that have already been released, there is a very real threat of serious harm as a result of exposure.the epa and other government agencies are constantly comparing fukushima radiation to background and airplane radiation in an attempt to minimize the severity of exposure, even though these are two completely different kinds of radiation exposure.no safe level of radiation from nuclear falloutbackground and airplane radiation is an external emitter of radiation, while fukushima-induced radiation in food and water is an internal emitter. the former, which is considered normal radiation, hits your body from the outside, while the latter goes directly inside your body and into your digestive tract. it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the immense difference between the two, and the much more severe consequences associated with literally ingesting radiation verses having it hit your skin.in reality, there really is no safe level of radiation. no matter how many times the epa and others repeat the lie that radiation levels are too low to have any significant impact, the statement itself is patently false. many experts, including jeff patterson, do, former president of physicians for social responsibility, have stated that radiation exposure at any level is unsafe, and they are correct.there is no safe level of radionuclide exposure, whether from food, water or other sources. period, said patterson. exposure to radionuclides, such as iodine-131 and cesium-137, increases the incidence of cancer. for this reason, every effort must be taken to minimize the radionuclide content in food and water.and now that radioactive levels in some areas have actually exceeded epa maximums, patterson's statement is even more chilling. so while the mainstream media continues its near-total blackout on fukushima, the situation is actually becoming more severe than it has ever been. time will tell how severe the long-term effects of this disaster will be
3355,it is over 30 years since my mother died. my father had died a few years earlier. i did not stay with my mother more than a few days when my father died--i had moved across the country a few years before this and hated the city i'd grown up in, and being there or around all the struggles and (cold war era) crushings that the place and my mother brought up made me feel as if my identity were at risk. and so i left her to her grief. and when, three or four years later, she came to visit, i was preoccupied with a broken love affair and was rude, very rude, even though i could see she seemed sick. and when i learned six months later that she was going to die of cancer in a few months--though she'll be better now for awhile, so don't hurry back here, it'll only frighten her if both you kids come to visit now, i delayed going back to that city to, as i thought would probably be necessary, stay with her. and then there was the telegram that she had died.     and when i was a child, i stayed home from school playing sick and so she had to stay home with me, and i was a rude teenager, and i avoided, as a kid, helping her with chores, and my cat, when i was a young teen, made her extra work.     and i wasn't there for her--only one hug, one day, on parting--when she visited me, the last time, before she went home and no longer could fight being ill.        and now i have passed the age at which she died, and am even older, and the guilt (no, not rationally, but the old child's guilt and (more rationally based) young woman's guilt) remain, and the grieving, never finished.
3356,i have had mirena in for 3 months or 4, i don't remember exactly when it got put in. around the same time it did, maybe 3 weeks after my ob put it in. me and my husband had sex, didn't use condoms because mirena suppose to prevent pregnancy. anyways, lately something not right. i have been feeling weird inside my stomach. i have butterfly feelings and aches in my stomach. if i am pregnant i would be almost be 3 months. i can't put my daughter on my stomach long, pressure bothers it. i do get aches like cramps in my abdomen. my back aches like crazy. i don't think it's a period, because i just finished having a 2 month period from mirena.
3357,hi - i work as a mystery shopper, and have just been offered work conducting 55 visits to opticians to take eye tests. these will be done over a 6 week period. the eye test includes the pressure test of squirting high speed air (?) into the eyeball. i am concerned about the possible effects on the eyeball of doing so many tests in such a short space of time, particularly as my eyes usually hurt after this test has been done. i have an astigmatism, but as far as i am aware, no other medical conditions that might impact on this.what are your thoughts please.thanks
3358,hi, i,m 30 yrs old & a h.r. professional i have been told to undergo c3r treatment as the thickness of my right eye is 449 microns & left eye is 554 microns can i rectify the eyes without the above mentioned procedure 7 can you suggest me any other alternatives to rectify the same
3359,hi, my son (4 years old)    has been coughing for a very long time with no answers from his doctors.    his first xray in november of 2007 showed atalectasis.    docs sent him home saying he had croup and that atalectasis would clear up.    still coughing all these months, new pediatrician was diagnosed with asthma in december. his asthma is also exercise induced. saw pulmonologist and gave him flow vent and albuterol inhalers , along with decadron when the flare ups occurred and croup.    saw another new doctor because son was not getting better.    same peds office new doctor but was really ill...lots of phlegm etc, she gave him a zpak + nebulizer with albuterol solution.    we did that nothing changed.    sent him for second xray, which showed atalectasis and pneumonia altho the report didnt say any pneumonia, just atalectasis.    treated him with 10 days augmentin and pedia pred.    cough cleared up, no sickness either.    6 days after antibiotics , breathing tx's and pedia pred finished, cough returns with fever.    had chest ct and doc says atalectasis caused by asthma.    (i dont have this report in hand but will have exact report then).    could this be rmls?    oh also this doctor while she was treating my son with this last treatement also thinks my son has prader willi syndrome.    my son is 87lbs and 4 feet tall...but he is only 4 years old.    he was born a preemie by c-section.    he was 36 weeks when he was born.    anyway i asked what that was and she told me to google it that her partner came up with it.    i am dealing with not so very good health care where i live and am probably going to head to seattle for the childrens' hospital there if i can find a decent pulmonologist.    i am n. west montana.    i do however also have family in chicago and can travel there as well if anyone knows of a children's pulmonologist there.    my issues are i am not getting anything in concrete here. i am getting partial diagnosis of asthma,    if my child has asthma, why wasnt he returned to the original meds of flow vent medications after the    pneumonia cleared?    he was taking flow vent 2 x a day and albuterol inhaler 4x a day during a flare up. the kicker in all this is it all started in july of 2007 after a bout of croup.    he recovered from that but after that every time he got a cold he would cough till he vomited.    and in november he was never able to recover from it.    he literally coughed from november till march.    everytime the coughs would get bad is when he would vomit.    he actually figured out a way to cough without it hurting him so much.    he was given tylenol w/codeine to stop the spasming on several occasions.    i am so frustrated.    i am in the process of searching for a pulmonologist.    if anyone can shed any kind of light on this subject i would be so grateful.    i feel i have been shuffled around with no one really knowing what is going on with my son and i hope that we dont have any kind of permanent damage being mis diagnosed with any of this.    if anyone would like further info because you might have an answer for me please email me at ***@****.    please help this frustrated mom in getting some answers.

3362,married for 10yrs, i used to get orgasms during sex where as my husband would take longer time for erection or wouldn't get erected. recently after i came back from a vacation ( only me and kids went on vacation)i found lot of change in my husband in his appearance etc. i also doubted him of having any affair and when i confronted he denied. later when ever we have sex he gets erection immediately, which is very surprising to me, and more surprising is i don't get orgasm at all. i wonder how can there be so much change in person whom i knew for 10yrs, his immediate erection is raising lot of doubts in me, did he take any medication in my absence or was he involved sexually with someone else. what would be the reason, can any one help out please.
3363,i am recently suffering with peelings, from the back of my finger tips onto my palm of my hand. i has been stinging, what should i do doctor?
3364,hello girls,i was wondering if i could get your thoughts on this.i have been ttc for 15 months.i just had an hsg done on spet.13th.i was supposed to o about a week after that.but, never did.i use an opk and i never got a positive.but, most importantly i never got high temps.my af was due oct.1st and i never got it.but 4 days before she was due i had lots of ewcm.so for the heck of it i decided to start temping again.my temps were way up.and are still up.i am now 10 days late for af with no sign of her arrival.i did have af like cramps about a week and a half ago when she was supposed to come but never did.my stomach has been feeling weird lately,kinda like a muscle spasm on and off.i have been feeling sick and my boobs have gotten bigger.also i've had odd headaches on and off and have felt very light headed.i'm wondering is it possible to have o'd right before af was due and gotten pregnant?i'm trying to find an explanation for the ewcm, the high temps and no af along with the other symptoms i've been experiencing.this is the first time af has ever been late.the latest she has ever been was almost 5 days.and i've never gone a month without ovulating.i always had a positive opk and my temps always went up.what do you ladies think?have you ever heard of someone ovulating right before af and getting pregnant?please help!any input would be great.i figured if it did happen, it's still too early to test.i would only be about 10 dpo.i was going to test next week if af doesn't show.i really don't think she is going to though.i appreciate your help!thank you!baby dust to all!
3365,hoping someone can help here, my mother since last week has had vbad pains in her side.she went to the doctors last week gave a urine sample and there was pus in the urine (no blood) + slighly high blood press, she was prescribed some antibiotics for a bladder infection.this week the pain has got worse, she now has pain in her side, goes hot and cold all the time, feels nauseous, has a slight metallic taste in her mouth and feels very tired in my opinion just looks unwell.the doctor has now changed the antibiotics since he thinks it has now turned into a kidney infection, but wasnt sure if it is a problem with a kidney she had operated a few years ago....she has to give now another urine test, a blood test and a ultrascan in a weeks time.22 years she had a big blockage in her kidney they succesfully removed the blockage but it caused damage to it and only 25% of her left or right kidney is working ok, the doctor said that the kidney could be breaking down.any help please?thank youtoilet-duckuk

3368,hi,i've had my ileostomy since october 2007 following extensive abdominal surgery for appendix cancer and psuedomyxoma peritonei. i saw my surgeon last week who said i can have the reversal, how soon is up to me - i'm leaving it until the end of the year as i've had so much time off work and want some time without feeling rough after surgery.i'd really prepared myself for her saying a reversal wasn't going to be on the cards, and to be honest i haven't really had any probems accepting 'the little 'un' either psychologically or practically. i have, however, read numerous tales of raging diarrohea and up to 20 bm's daily following reversal, and quite frankly i don't want that!i'm not entirely sure how much colon i've had removed. my surgeon is a bit (no a lot!) scary and i haven't asked, although i do know i had a lot of tumour around my rectum and it's usual to have at the least the ascending colon removed with appendix cancer. i've also had all non-essential abdominal organs and linings removed including about 6 inches of small intestines - my whole abdomen was described as looking as if it was spray painted white with tumour, all but 2 spots that are less than 2.5cm have been removed and they should be 'killed off' with intraperitoneal heated chemo during the surgery -    i feel almost back to 'normal' again and i want to get on with life again rather than having to worry about feeling tired/sore/embarrassed/ill/reminded/worried etc.i would like to know about other people's experiences of reversals, is 'it' like 'it' was before?is it really just the odd few that have problems afterwards, and do they have an idea beforehand what it's going to be like?how much colon has to be left for good results?i've actually spent more time worrying about the consequences of getting rid of my ileostomy than i did getting one, which is mad!lisa
3369,i am 14 years old and for the past 2 years i have been dealing with fairly painful lumps and open cysts in my uderams that puss ocassionaly. every once in a while they scab over and close up but when they get too close to the surface of my skin they come back and they are even more painful. my mom has taken me to a dermatoligist and a regular doctor. the dermatoligist gave me antibiotics and some kind of acne cream, which did not work. then the regular doctor gave me some antibitics and they barely did anything. i am becoming very concerned and i just want an answer to what it might be. the doctors told me to not shave under there so i don't. i have read some things that say it could be a swollen lymph node, swollen hair follecle, and staph infection. please is there any doctor out there that can help me? these stupid cysts are ruining my social life by making me soooo self concious..........please help me!!!this discussion is related tosmall lump in armpit.
3370,i have yet to see my bariatric surgeon because i am going through 12 weeks of pre-classes.    however, i am concerned that in 2001 i had to have myotomy surgery for the treament of achalasia and am hoping that this will not intervere with having roux-y surgery.    any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
3371,i have only one good eye(optic nerve underdeveloped in one eye) and i am therefore very paranoid about my good eye. the issue is when to go to the ophthalmologist. i sometimes see something that i think might have been a flash, or i notice the floaters seem more numerous. it makes no sense to go in every week for an exam, but i 'd hate to wrongfully ignore an important symptom. i know you guys can't speak in absolutes, but what should i look out for?-is a small change in cobweb floater number or motion ok or something to worry about?-are the pepper (blood cell) floaters primarily the ones to worry about?-is an occasional flash ok, or should any flash be checked out?-are bad flashes persistent, meaning they start and don't stop or intermittent?-are these flashes something very defined in position or do they fill the whole field?basically, when to worry? will it be obvious something is up, or will it be sneaky?thanks.
3372,i had a cholesterol profile done and my lp-pla2 and lipoprotien high resol blood work came back slightly high. does anyone know what this means?i have been getting shooting pains down my left arm the pain only last about 10 to 30 seconds then it comes back it does this on and off all day.this also happens in my back (left side) kind of around the shoulder blade.i also have been getting a very weird sensationin same area of back, it kinda feels a little fuzzy, again it happens on and off and only last 10 to 30 seconds each time.thanks in advance for any helpkimmie
3373,i'm 36yrs old female. this is the first time that i'm on my menses and it has a very bad smell. why or when does this occur?
3374,i don't know how long it has been like this. i have never had a pelvic exam and i've been sexually active since i was 16 (i am not 20), although i have been tested with urine and blood for stds. also i often masterbate with the tub faucet in my bathroom. is something wrong with me or is it possible that it just happens to look like that? do i have cancer and the skin down there is all dead and thats why its all pale?! ..the skin tags aren't like pimples or warts or anything.. just look like lil skin tags dangling.. also pale in color.also i noticed just recently (although im not sure for how long, maybe forever, it has been there) there is a mole near the opening to my vagina.. at least im pretty sure its a mole.. i think has grown but not sure.. maybe darkened.. anyways,i know some of the details could possibly be irrelevant but i want to make sure to include everything to get the best possible answer.
3375,hi im a 17 year old boy and i like to work out.    lately ive been working out more then i normally would.    but now im stating to get these blue marks on my chest that look like veins... am i starting to get strech marks and if so what can i do to stop them without having to stop working out?
3376,i just went through a hysterectomy 11 days ago.    i was having severe pain on my right side.    when checked out on ultrasound- stated it was 7.5 cm.    i traveled to another island to see the ob/gyn.    she did a complete hysterectomy since the ovary was covered by endometriosis, was internally bleeding, and full of several cysts.    when removing the uterus, they found it was fused with the bladder and the intestines.    they finally got everything out, except the cervix which they stitched closed.two days ago, i had half of the staples removed (there were 22 of them and some are infected). they will remove the others today.    for two days now, i have been very depressed, wanting to cry every few minutes.    is this normal? i was so upbeat when i had the surgery- often walking and overdoing it the first few days home.    now it seems i am so low beat.    (i even went by myself to the other island to have the surgery- no one was with me or any physical/emotional support except prayers). i am just concerned as if this is a normal step to go through the process? please help if you can.lollybeth

3379,helloi wasn't sure which forum to post this in,however i'm hoping someone can answer my question.on monday i woke up and noticed two long scratches on the left side of my groin/close to crease in my leg which i must have done in my sleep, i didn't think much of them.the following day i woke up and noticed that i had a swollen lump in the left side of my groin next to where the scratches are. i am guessing it is a swollen lymph node?....it is quite achy/sore. would a small thing like scratches cause a lymph node to swell?i will admit that i am a bit of worrier, so i apologize if this question seems ridiculous. the lump feels firm/tender/sore/and moveable (i think). it also disappears when i lie down - when i was younger ihad a hernia removed from next to my belly button (left side) could this be related?i have recently just got over a sinus infection,although in this case i am guessing that is irrelevent as sinuses are not located in    the groin.i'd be grateful for any feedback.

3383,for a few years now my daughter (age 9) has done some things that have alarmed me.    a few years ago i found a pouting doll (the ones that stand in the corner) that she played with - she had dug out the mouth and private areas of the doll.    i dont' think she did anything with them just bore it out.    then she has a picture/story bible that i noticed all of the girls eyes and mouths were shaded in in pencil, nothing else was drawn or colored just that.    then just recently in her school agenda she did the same thing to a girl on one of the pages.    this behavior really disturbes me as i fear she may have some issues.    if anything really traumatic happens she doesn't talk about it much, and if she does its like it's no big deal. please let me know if i should take her to a therapist, and maybe suggest one near by.
3384,im 20 yrs old im 5'2 i weigh 176 lbs (the most ive ever weighed) ive always weighed from 130-140.is it possible to lose 46 pounds in 14 weeks, im not looking to starv myself just eat right, i plan to start slow with walking than jogging than running. in the last few days i been walking from 5-7 miles a day at night, and my body feels good with the walks, im suprised it doesnt get me tired, i love it.any good tips to lose the wight? can i lose the 46 pounds in 14 weeks?
3385,i had a biopsy for a mole on my upper chest area just below by neck.    the biopsy was about 4 years ago and the scar left itches badly at times.    is this normal and what can i do to stop the itching.    i have been using regular lotion that seems to calm it a bit.
3386,i am highly considering the novasure. as many ladies mentioned why they choose the procedure, i am in the same boat.very heavy cycles, clotting heavly, last 7_10 days, heavy cramping to whear i have to use heating pad and motri. and hot tea to help. sometimes layi.g in fetal position helps.in addition to being anemic with leg pain. thank all of u for sharing.*****for the several woman who had it done in 2007, please update your pros and cons. thank you
3387,this is not my first time having sex, i have had it a few times before. but i recently have had a new boyfriend and we have a lot of sex, and its really rough sometimes... also, the last time i had sex before my recent boyfriend was 10 months before me and my recent boyfriend had sex. me and my recent boyfriend have been sexually active for almost 3 months. he has been tested and has no stds. i have already had a yeast infection about a month or a little over a month ago. but about 4 days ago while we were having sex it burned so bad i has to stop. the next day we tried again and the same thing happend, and i had an even worse burning after. it still burns sometimes and kinda itches. and my vagina was really red. i don't know if its from have sex a lot? i don't know what to do or what it is help!
3388,ok, this is an embarassing question but does anyone else have facial hair?    i have fine hair above my upper lip but it is kind of dark so it is somewhat noticable.    i have to bleach it. is this normal or could i have some sort of hormone problem? my periods are regular and everything, i don't really show any other signs of having a problem besides oily skin.
3389,before my cataract surgery aug. 9, i wore inline progressive lenses mainly for distance as i took them off to read for more than a few moments. though my reading vision has now improved from the complete blur after surgery, i still depend on the unoperated eye to read. i have received a new prescription and will return in 6 mo. to check the cataract in the other eye. i tried reading glasses for the reading prescription and found i could not read with them. should i spend the money for these possibly short term in line progressive lenses and wear them expecting my eyes to adjust, or am i risking wasting my money and finding i am better off as i am? i have 20/30 vision with the operated eye, using it for distance and reading with the other eye.

3391,nighty night all...i know ladies..i am sooo 10 minutes ago on that post but i am lamo what can i say! i opened this up for you all night gals.miss ya love ya bye now!
3392,recently my family moved out of the neighborhood we lived in for several years.    my son who is five, has a friend in our old neighborhood who he has known and been best friends with since birth.    recently on play dates, the two of them have been extemely excited to see eachother, and have hugged and kissed.     i did not think much of it until this last time when my son told me after his playdate that his friend was his boyfriend and they are going to get married.    i told him that kissing his friend was not appropriate, and that i know that they are friends and really miss eachother.    any thoughts???
3393,i got feeling like that my heart is burning, it's not the exact word what i want to express though. i feel like this whenever my boyfriend tell me something cold or act wrong. what's this symptom? i feel it inside of my body, part of my chest, between chest bone i think.... is it dangerous symptom? it occurs often.......what's this?
3394,a friend and i feed a flock of city pigeons every day (rock doves), at about the same time,along with a flock of sparrows. there are nineteen pigeons in the group and nine sparrows.the sparrows delight in swiping bits of bread from the rock doves a second before they reach it!nevertheless, the rock doves don't attack them, but seem to take it good naturedly.the sparrows and the pigeons have become quite friendly, and we have given names to the pigeons, all of whom have different personalities. they will eat out of one's hand and will hop on a table and try to get into the bag where we bring a muffin or bread. they love bits of hot dog.the most dominent pigeon is big debbie, who fluffs up, chases the other birds away, seems to want all the attention and all the food.one of the more interestihg observations is the fact one sparrow (an adult) had an injured leg and the other sparrows pick up bread bits, carry it over to this adult and feed it.i am surpised at the comments we get. people really seem to hate these birds.
3395,hello all,i'm 19 years old and i went through chicken pox at the age of three. one time i woke up during the night and started scratching my face but when my mother realised i what was going on it is was a bit too late. as a result, i now have 2 small round scars on my face which are not scary, disgusting or anything it's just that i really really wanna get rid of them. is there a cream or a treatment from dermatologist or maybe a cosmetic surgery i can have to make the scars disappear or at least become less noticable? also will chemical peeling help? thank you very much in advance :)
3396,i have recetnyl developed finger-like growths on my labia, and the doctor told me to keep an eye on them to see if the texture changes b/c it may be hpv. i am not satisfied with this approach, and want to have a biopsy done so that they can tell me once and for all what i have, instead of having to wait around and get all nervous and stressed about it.can anyone tell me if it is possible for me to have a biopsy done at a planned parenthood, or if i have to go somewhere else? thankyou!
3397,i had gum grafting surgery 2 weeks ago, and although most paitents are back to work or school the next day, i had several problems. for the first 4 days after surgery, my face swelled up like a balloon!    i had bruising around my jowls and under my eyes from the swelling.    when the doctor took out the packing, the swelling went down quickly, but then the jaw pain started.    i was having a lot of pain around in the area of the gums but also in my jaw on one side.    stranger still, i had only had the surgery on the top but the jaw pain is on the top and bottom.    when i reported this to my doctor he prescribed an antibiodic and vicoden for the pain.    he told me to call back if the pain was not completely gone.    i called back in a couple of days and reported that my gums felt better (but not great), but the pain in my jaw was unbearable.    he just prescribed more vicoden and told me that some people take longer to heal.    it has been two weeks and i am really getting concerned.    is this part of the healing process or should i seek medical treatment from someone else?    if so, who?    thanks for any advice you can give me.
3398,i read this last night, and wanted to share it with those who are not yet aware of this.    i think this is a very good ideal since so many people are members of this social network.     anything that might help bring those babies home safely is exactly what the media, and all social networks need to be implementing.http://www.14wfie.com/story/13832532/facebook-creating-amber-alert-pagesposted: jan 12, 2011 4:04 pm cst wednesday, january 12, 2011 5:04 pm est updated: jan 12, 2011 4:04 pm cst wednesday, january 12, 2011 5:04 pm estposted by kelsey wheatcroft - email(nbc) - facebook is hoping to use its popularity to help find missing children.the social web site is teaming up with the national center for missing and exploited children and the department of justice. facebook will create amber alert pages for each state, the district of columbia, puerto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands.    officials say facebook users will be able to receive posts about amber alerts in their area.
3399,about 8 1/2 months ago i had a full molar pregnancy.........after a d&c that included severe bleeding complications, i was told to wait 6 months to a year before again attempting to get pregnant....so, about 3 months ago my levels went down to zero, and i was told that i could start trying to get preg.....to my suprise, the first day of my last period was feb 17, and i just took 3 pregnancy tests and they came out pos.i went to the doc yesterday for a sonogram, and they only saw the sak and the yolk sak, which is totally normal for a 5 or 6 week pregnancy, then i went today, and got blood work done, my nurse called me back and said my levels were 14000, and that my doctor said that at this point, with those levels that we should see a baby by now...i am so sad, dissappoimted, hurt, mad.........has anyone ever gone through this???they still want me to come back in a few days and test my levels again.....and i have an appointment for next week for another ultrasound...........does this mean that this is another unhealthy pregnancy??please help!!!!
3400,i got the mirena at the end of march and it was all fine until here recently i have been extremely tired, eating alot and very irritable. i took a home pregnancy test and it said neg. but my body is acting as if i am pregnant. i already have 2 sons already and my youngest is only 4 months old. i want another baby but definetly not right now, my children are only 13 months apart. shoould me and my husband start using condoms or is this normal on this kinda birth control??
3401,i went to the er yesterday because i was having symptoms of a uti. it hurts when i urinate. it doesnt burn its just painful. i constantly feel like i have to pee but when i go barely anything will come out and im in pain after that. so the antibiotics they prescribed me yesterday made me feel very sick to the point i had to go home from work. so i called the er and they told me to come back in. this is only 24 hours after being diagnosed with a uti from a urine specimen. i did another urine test and the doctor told me it did not test positive for a uti so they did a pelvic exam and told me i have a yeast infection and to stop the antibiotics and start using monistat.ive had utis and yeast infections before. this does not feel like a yeast infection. i have no burning or itching or cottage cheese like discharge. im at a loss for what to do. i have no insurance and i cant keep running to the er but my symptoms arent getting any better. i've already missed 3 shifts at work due to the original symptoms and how sick the antibiotic made me. do i need to go get another opinion or just try the monistat and see how that works??i'm so confused and upset. i just want to feel better.
3402,my mother is 62 years old and obese.    she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago and is now admitted to a local hospital with an inflamed gall bladder.    she is to receive iv antibiotics until surgery can be performed.    i do not believe that her physician is being frank with her regarding her eating habits and how it is affecting her health.    is there someone in the hospital that can talk to her and make her understand that she is killing herself with food?

3404,hello! i'm writing from estonia. my aunts husband has some kind of genetic disease. his parents are normal, but he and his sister are both sick. he also has a daughter with the same disease. i also added a picture of him. the symptoms of this diseas are: short legs and stocky torso and ankles have a small absence of motion. the daugter is also quite heavy if to consider that she is only a child. and it is difficult for her to do sports like skiing and running.    they haven't got any help from estonian doctors and this disease is also the reason why they can't have a child. it would be very likely that their child will have the same disease.can you tell what kind of disease this is and could it be prevented before a child is born?
3405,i was in a car accident about 3 weeks ago.    perhaps a week after the accident bruises appeared on my thigh. they looked pretty bad. at the time, it appeared that i had faded bruises...but really what happened was that those bruises were coming to the surface. the original bruises have faded, the second set of bruises are fading, but it looks like a whole new crop of fresh bruises are appearing.    what is going on?
3406,well i always measured cuz i didnt have a scale. i got a scale and noticed that even knowing my measureing tape wasnt changing, the scale was. i lost 30 pounds since i last weighed myself (when i bought the scale i was down 30)now that i have the scale, i kinda stopped measuring. though the scale wasnt moving much, i still keep up with my exercise as much as i can because i can enjoy it.measurments when i first got the scale:chest: 37''under boobs:31''at belly button: 38''hips:40''butt:41''today when i measured:chest:36''under boobs:29''at belly button: 36''hips:39''butt:40''the difference:chest: -1''under boobs: -2''at belly button: -2''hips: -1''butt: -1''just wanted to share mu success...and brag, what can i say i was happy, had to share with someone. :p
3407,hello--i had a crown completed on upper left molar 7 weeks ago.    i had no pain before the crown and had crown done due to advice from my dentist--he said there was a crack on the tooth.    i also had very little/no pain while wearing the temporary crown for three weeks.    i felt enormous, intense pain while the temporary crown was removed and the permanent crown put on.    i have been in pain ever since.    the pain hasn't gotten better or any worse--just a dull, aching pain that makes the entire side of my head hurt.    i returned to the dentist 3 weeks ago and had an    x-ray done--the dentist said it doesn't look like i have an infection.    he applied ice to the affected tooth---shooting pain!    he then said i possibly have reversible pulpitis.    i am not sure if i accurately communicated to him that my pain is constant.    right now, i take 200 milligrams of ibuprofin every four hours, and my pain is manageable.    but i don't want to live like this any longer if a root canal is inevitable.    i am really hoping that the tooth will get better on its own.    part of me thinks that the tooth was so aggravated by the permanent crown being put on, that it is just taking forever to heal--but of course i don't know that for sure!    i just want advice whether or not i should seek root canal treatment.    thank you.
3408,hello dr. tsang,my question is about my top molar second to the back. it has given me problems for quite some time and i think a filling may have fallen out.    12 days ago i was out shooting a rifle which put some pressure on my right cheek ,however i felt no obvious pain or injury at the time. that night i noticed slight swelling on the right side of my face. the next day it was pretty swollen, and i could feel a very large,hard bump when i ran my finger along my upper gums/inner cheek. the next day i went to the dentist who put me on augmentin 875g bid ,and said my xray showed an abcess(abscess)above the bad tooth. by the way, i never had any pain whatsoever, at all. 1 week later i returned to his office for a debridement of the abcess(abscess).    he said the antibiotics were doing the job and no pus came out at all. he put a temp filling over the tooth and i will return in one month for a root canal and crown.    however today, 2 days later, my face is extremely swollen and bruised and the hard lump is still on my upper gums ,not smaller at all. my question is why hasn't the lump reduced in size after debridement? could it have been a huge hematoma and not an abcess(abscess), due to the pressure of the rifle on my cheek? my face is a little sore from being swollen, but no tooth pain all all, never was. i fear the lump may have been there a long time, and i am wondering if cancer is an issue? the lump looked clear on the xray but you could see the outline of it.    he is a good dentist , and i assume if their was any question he would not let it wait. right?
3409,i moved 6 months ago from mi to ca and 4 months ago developed severe blepheritis and seborrheic dermititis. i asked the docs if the weather change could be the cause since i never had issues before. he said yes that because of lack of humidity in ca which mi has and the winds. is this true?

3412,i never have taken any vitamins. i would like to know what i should take on a daily basis. i work at a pharmacy so i come in contact with sick people everyday. i am often tired and find that i dont sleep well at night. also i have just stopped bitting my nails, they are growing but slowly and very brittle.    i have long hair as well but i am finding that ,even though i dont use chemicalls, it is breaking alot and does not seem to be growing as fast as before .

3414,hello ladies...after a rough 2 weeks (finding out about pregnancy/then m/c) my hcg levels are back to 0.    i need a bc method that will work since i am now terrified of getting pregnant again right away.    condoms are uncomfortable - even with lubricant...and i just can't remember to take the pill (hence the pregnancy last time).    do any of you have suggestions?    i think that the sponge or diaphram seem impractical.    i do not want to go back on depo since my boyfriend & i are planning on getting married/starting a family in the next year or two...any suggestions would be appreciated - i will look into them all!!!thanks!alexis
3415,i'm under 40 years old.    my eye prescription is -11.5 and -9.5.    diameter = 14.0.    i wear regular (not toric) contacts.    i    had surgery a few years ago to stop a slight retinal tear.    the tear was diagnosed early and follow up visits have been completed with no issues.    i use the computer daily. i look at small computerized text and small print all the time.the problem:my clarity & distance vision seem to be getting worse - although i still read about the same on the eye chart test.    my peripheral vision is distorted.    when people walk close to me from a side angle, or are directly in front of me (maybe around 1-2 feet away from me), it's near impossible for me to maintain eye contact without blinking often or feeling 'cross-eyed'.     i blink a lot to 'refocus' my vision.    i have extreme light sensitivity. my eyes look big.    they look    unfocused & huge (like 'deer in headlights') in photos.    they looked normal in photos a few years ago.    one eye looks slightly larger than the other in recent pictures.    doctor measurements say the pupils are within the same size range.    my eye lids are basically normal.    one doctor suggest one eye lid hangs very slightly lower - making the amount of 'white' of one eye less prominent    - making the eye appear smaller than the other.    occassionally, i have headaches (not migraines) on only one side of my head.    my eyes are always a tired, strained and sometimes red.    i don't have any eye pain worth mentioning.    one eye 'pulses' or 'ticks' sometimes. since retinal tear surgery, i have an occassional small 'floater'.    i occassionally see 'ripples of light' within one eye.    when it happens, it's kind of like how the material within a lcd computer monitor screen 'displaces' and 'spreads out' when you run your finger down the lcd screen...    how i view color:    one eye sees a white paper as a slight tighted or off white, compared to the other eye.    i passed every eye test (color blindness tests, visual field, optic nerve, retinal test) that my multiple eye doctors gave me.    they think my eyes are just getting old.    cat scans were not done, since my symptoms are too vague.    my primary care doctor ran blood tests to rule out thyroid and autoimmune stuff - and couldn't find a problem.    i'm tired of doctors, but think something is not right.    your thoughts?
3416,hi.i'm a single mother, i have a daughter she's going on six yearl old.    she's attending kindergarden.    lately i have been receiving letters from school that she's been pushing other kids, kicking some of them, lying, and this is happening more often then it did before.    i have punished her for 3 days without no tv no toys nothing she sits on her time out chair but i don't believe this punishment is working.    i have tried talking to her the counseling.    i'm a single mother she doesn't observe this kind of behavior at my house or at my relatives house what should i do with her please help me get the answers.    thank you
3417,the more i research, the more confused i get, so maybe someone has something similar:in april, i was diagnosed with vaginal strep, which consisted of a creamy, grayish discharge that was sometimes thick and other times thin with what looked like gray clumps in it.    there was intense itching and a distinct, nonoffensive smell.    there was no redness of the vulva, no pain during urination.    i was treated, and supposedly it went away, althought there was a profuse white discharge afterwards (what i assumed and treated as a yeast infection).in late june, the same discharge/odor/itch/no pain during urination came back, and i assumed it was the same strep infection.    i did not treat it this time, and it went away.now (aug 30), i have a new perplexing situation:    after my period ended earlier this week, there was an intense itching with a thick, clumpy discharge.    it looked mucopurulent (thick, hint of yellow), itched, no odor, no pain during urination.    i had sex (itching afterwards, which i realize is worrisome) with my boyfriend, who is a diabetic and has no symptoms.    in the morning, there was some slightly brown, thin discharge (assuming from me being dry and rough mutual masturbation?)    then in the early afternoon, the discharge changed to thin and yellow (less itching, no pain during or change in frequency of urination), and now it has a foul smell (it reminds me of mulch or walking through the botanic gardens... odd).    i have a doc appointment scheduled for next week, but was curious in the meantime... has anyone has similar symptoms or a diagnosis?    thank you so much, i appreciate it!
3418,during my pregnancy i was on bed rest, and have pratically had my midsection and chest disfigured.i have always been fit and have ate a healthy diet. i don't know why the pregnancy did so much damage to my body even my doctor was shocked. she said surgery is the only solution. it bothers me everyday not just because of the appearance but the loose skin makes it difficult to find clothes to wear. it is very emotional. i eat healthy and exercise. i am a runner and it can sometimes be painful due to the stretched skin. i want to have procedures to fix the problem, but i am currently trying to resolve things on my credit due to identity theft so i was denied financing. is there any good surgeons who do pro bono work on things like this. or is there any other way i can pay for the surgeries. i do have insurance. it is something that effects my life everyday and i don't want to keep living with this problem. i would appreciate any suggestions. i'd like to have my daughter see me run a marathon, but it isn't possible with my body like this. thanks.
3419,i've just joined this forum it sounds great,i'm a 47 year old female from australia,i've been clean of alcohol and codeine for 35 days now.i was sexually abused by my brother who was 10 years older than me at the ages of 7 to 10 so i used the substance abuse as a way to fog my brain so i didn't have to deal with the guilt and other issues related to the abuse,now with a clear brain every memory is back x 10,so i'm back in therapy just to try and cope with my feelings and thoughts,is there anyone else dealing with some of the same issues, there doesn't seem to be any forum for incest victims-yes 40 years later i still feel like a victim.
3420,my husband started coughing so hard that he passed out today. he hit his head on our deck and didn't really know what happened when he came to it. all he can really remember was coughing. can a person cough so hard that they can pass out?
3421,my husband was taken off invega 6 months ago he is still taking serqual, but did not develope the side effects of constant touge and mouth movement until after the invega, now he also has problems with to much saliva, he has problems eating and it causes him to cough up flim . how or what can we to to ease these effects?
3422,when she is mad about something she has been pulling her hair and poking herself in her eyes and now she started bitting herself i don't understand what this means i was very concerned because she seems to be mad all the time or crying about something. i have tried to bring it up to the dr but i can't seem to get the right words out. i don't know how young a person has been told that they are bipolar but it does run on my husbands side he is his mom and so on. my question would be is she to young to get what she needs now before she really hurts herself. but she has been thru alot in her young little life as far as dr.s hospital's and it just keeps going could that be another reason she acts like thisthank youa very stressed and frustrated mom
3423,ever since i can remember i have had this lump on the left side of my head. right where my temple is. if i get stressed, cry really hard, or hang upside down (where pressure starts to come into my head) it swells up. i went to the doctor a couple years ago and the nurse wanted to lance it or something. stick a needle in it to drain it. well my dad said no way, you don't even know what it is for sure. so then the doctor did a cat scan and thinks it's just a cyst and didn't do anything about it. well when it swells up it gets very painful and large. and other times its barely noticeable. though i can always feel it by touching it. right now the past couple days it's been really sore. when i open my mouth wide it hurts. i'm afraid and don't know what to do about this.this discussion is related tosebaceous cyst on scalp.
3424,its a simple issue...i have dated this guy for 4 months now, we have never talked about us being bf/gf, but we are both exclusive to each other since the very first date and we pretty much do act as bf/gf. a couple weekends back one of his friends got stranded in the city i live and i told him, if he doesn't have a place to stay he can come stay here tonight and catch the train in the morning, so he txted his friend: get a cab and come stay at my girl friends place. to which i asked him, oh so now i'm ur friend? he said, no!! not my friend, you are my girlfriend, so i'm like, oh ok i guess we are official now. nothing changed as we both don't need titles or anything of the sort, we are very comfortable just being together, we know we are for each other and thats why i have not pushed him to say i'm his gf. anyway, his sister called and asked who i was since she saw my comments on facebook, and he told me, his answer to her was, oh is just a girl i recently met and we are just going out. at the moment i didn't see anything wrong with it, til i told one of my friends and she said, oh so he is like hiding you...now i'm confussed if i should start getting worried about the gf in front of friends but just met in front of family. maybe there's something i'm not being aware in respect to his commitment to me??!! any comments are welcome!
3425,i have frequent headaches, chest pains near or away from my heart, back pains, random cramping and i have just noticed that i have recently been getting sick often. should i be worried?
3426,i'm wondering if my thyroid problems are likely the main culprit to bleeding after protected sex.....???i'm currently hyperthyroid (overmedicated for hypothyroid treatment), had sex 2 days after finishing my period, and have been bleeding for 4 days now (much like a light period). the bleeding came maybe half a day later, not right away.    i spot occasionally (two weeks before my next period), but i'm worried that the bleeding has lasted too long and that i could be pregnant or have a mass on my cervix or something.    ah!    i need some advice!
3427,my back has been hurting me so bad, on my lower back.... im thinking from the impederial after having 2 children.. i am also on para gard bc, and has notice terrible stomach pain since then. could my back pain be from the bc? or imperderial??
3428,so how was your week?good, bad, challenging, successful, motivating?this thread is truly to let each of us know how the other members are doing in an honest, sincere, caring and supporting environment.    we're not here to judge anyone - we're all here to support, nurture and teach each other some of the tools for success!what kind of support community would we be if we only talked when everyone did well?    how was your week???the board is not quite as active and it always makes me wonder if members are failing and not wanting to post.    please do.personally, this was a good week for me weight-wise and a recuperative week personally.    the stresses of the last 3 weeks have resolved, some with favorable outcomes and some not.    it's been a struggle not to overeat during this time and our month-long clown versus tutu challenge came at a most opportune time to help me focus.    previously i kept going up and down the scale and was fairly complacent in staying where i was and not moving forward and completing my journey.    well, the back pack is on and this little wanderer is back on the path with the support of you members!now .. we'd truly love to hear about your week ....

3431,i have a negative rh factor and my husband is positive. i believe my daughter is negative. what are the chances that our other children will be negative? ( a-, o+ and daughter is i think o-?)off the topic a bit but anyone know anything about reoccurring leg pains, thought it might be hereditary or something. thought it was due to lack of calcium too but doesn't see that way any more i take 3 600mg tablets a day some times a little less maybe one more every now and then.thanks in    advance.
3432,hi, i'm 14 years old and when i was about 11 years old i started to pull my own hair out of my scalp, but i'm not sure how i started doing it but it just became a bad habit. by the time i was 12 i had a load of bald patches dotted around my head and my hair was extremley thin. i was really self conscious about my hair and started to eat more, my mum told me that if i didn't stop soon she would take me the doctors because my hair was in such a bad state. by the time i was about 13 years old i really wanted to try and stop and loose some weight, but it was more difficult that i thought, but gradually the habit started to fade, every now and then i still pull some of my hair out, but i'm much better now and have lost a bit of weight too. i was wondering if anyone knows any reasoning of why i may have started pulling my hair out? and maybe some remedies to try and grow and thicken my hair again the way it used to be?thanks for any answers x

3445,my 8 year old son has been showing no affection towards me recently.    he continues to hug his dad and tell him that he loves him.    he is reluctant to give mom a hug, and hasn't said i love you to me in over a year.    i have been struggling with feelings of hurt, worthlessness, and heartache due to this.    i try to continue to be a loving mom, and always tell him that i love him unconditionally.    is this perhaps the time where he identifies with dad more??    how should i handle this so that i don't become resentful and angry towards him??

3448,i have been on birth control pills since my marriage in july 2004.    my husband and i are not trying to become pregnant, and that's why i am taking ortho tri-cyclen lo.    halfway through my cycle, just after my peak fertility days, i took my birth control pill, but after we had had intercourse (without a condom), i threw up.    i don't know how long after i took my pill that i threw up, but just to be safe, i took another pill around 6am.    we abstained from intercourse until the next weekend and i skipped one pill during that week to get back on track.    i took the last 4 birth control pills in the dialpak on time.    unfortunately, i have not started my period.    i am frightened in that i'm late and we didn't want to have a child this soon after our marriage.basically, i am asking what to do next time i throw up my pill right after sex.    thanks.

3452,so i had my wisdom teeth pulled out on dec.30th 2010 and on the 21st of january 2011 my cheek started to be inflamed. i went to the oral surgeon and he said that it was an infection, so he cut me up to let fluid drain he said. it took a week to heal, and i was fine for 2 days, then    it got inflamed once again. so i went back to the oral surgeon again and the second time he cut me up almost all the way past my molar and deep enough that the bone was showing. i got stitches and i was sent home once again to heal for another week. both times he has put me on 15 amoxicillin pills and 150 mg of clindamycin. second time he gave me an iv, to put in sodium chloride, and i was not given any amoxicillin but kept on the clyndamycin. my cheek has been going down but i was unable to open my mouth still due to pressure and irritation way in the back of my mouth. i can hardly open my mouth now and my cheek looked fine as of 5 hours ago. currently it is making its way back to being inflamed swollen. i took my last clyndamycin pill today at 9:00pm. i am very frustrated at this point due to the lack of nutrition i have had to deal with for two weeks and i would like to know whether i should just go to the hospital or go back to this oral surgeon and complain about my cheek again? is it even worth it?

3455,i just realized that i have an tiny, itchy bump on my vagina.    it is located on my labia majora, under my pubic hair.    it isnt painful at all, but it is itchy. i dont think it is an ingrown hair because it is not painful.    it feels like a mosquito bite. what could this be? i am 22 years old and had sex for the first time about 3 months ago with my boyfriend of over a year.    i ruled out any sexual transmitted diseases because from what i know he doesnt have any, and if he did wouldn't sympotoms show after we had sex for the first time?    also, if this helps, i just finished my period today and thats when i noticed the bump...and i just started using baby powder in my underwear, i don't know if that could have caused this.    please help, i have a slight case of hypochondria, and i am worried i could have some kind of serious disease.    i know its probably nothing but someone please help!

3458,how bad will exophoria impact my sons life? will it ever go away or will he have to live with it the rest of his life?
3459,i married a man 13 years younger than me.    i love him very much, he is my soul mate, he is a good man and we had a great sex life our first 2 years together.    we have been together 5 years and we hardly ever fight i am happier than i have every been and feel lucky to have my life.    however, lately, i am having issues with him wanting sex more than i do. i want to be the one to initiate sometimes and that never happens.    i usually end up giving in just so he will leave me alone sometimes and that just isn't right.    i do like sex, and he is a loving and caring partner, that isn't the issue.     the biggest issue i think is that he is younger and i have issues with getting him to help more around the house.    i work more than he does, i take care of all the bills, i manage his business and mine, and i have to remind him to do all the things he is supposed to me doing which most of the time i end up doing. i am exhausted most of the time.    the house is a mess because i dont have time and he is supposed to do it but it gets so bad to the point i can't have people over, or have no dishes and am drinking out of tupperware bowls because we have no clean glasses.    i have a hard time living in an environment that is so messy and chaotic, i literally want to go stay in a hotel sometimes.    he will wait until the dishes are so bad that we have maggots in the sink before he will get to them sometimes.    our car engine blew up because he never kept up with the maintance and i had to deal with getting that fixed.    i spend my only time off cleaning.    i ask him for help, i tried making task lists, i tried giving him space, i have tried everything and nothing seems to work.    i try to have him help with simple things like errands, but he feels if he does one thing for the day he is done.    he can't multi task to save his life.    he works, comes home and gets on hist computer or his xbox and plays games.    this is the only thing he likes to do so i don't want to take that away from him since he always comes home to me and isnt out at clubs or with his friends all the time like some husbands.    but i just wish he would spend 2 hours    day helping me.    most of this is my fault, i enabled him because i had more experience than running a house and a business so i did just take over these things naturally, so i think he is just used to me doing everything.    when i tried to get him to help, he just couldn't get into the groove i guess and i probably was a little rough on him because he wasn't doing things right.    i almost relate it to how i felt as a teenager, when mom gave you choirs and you shirked them because you knew in the end she would do them or she would just take over because you weren't doing them right.    i struggle with trying to get him to learn how i had to learn when i was on my own and became responsible.     i am not sure how to get him there, that is an ongoing struggle.    the biggest problem now is that it has affected our sex life, he wants sex from me daily and i get so annoyed because i feel like it is just one more thing i have to do, like another job or another task i have no control of.    i resent him for not helping me more and have told him if he helped me more i would feel more in the mood.    in fact, when i seem him take initiative it makes me look at him differently and i want to have sex with him.    i give him lots of affection, even initiating sex when he is in the middle of a choir, hoping to inspire him more.    i have expressed to him that his lack of help is affecting me physically and mentally.    3 months ago i ended up having to get 45 stitches in my hand because he didn't help me move something so when i tried i got hurt.    he felt awful and for a short time seemed to snap out of it.    but it didn't take long for him to go back to his old ways.    he loves me and i know if he really understood that it hurts me he isn't helping, that he would step up.    i have told him this is what is affecting our sex life and he is trying to help more but i am still overwhelmed.    i think he things i am superwoman and so he just doesn't get it.    i worry that if we can't resolve this, our marriage will be in trouble.    i have run out of ideas on how to fix this.
3460,hello,so i am wondering if anyone can help me figure out what is happening to my tongue.    two days after kissing a girl i noticed my tongue had turned white.    i went to the doctor where the pa told me i had thrush and gave me nystatin which did not help it.    two days after that visit to the doctor i developed a real bad flu.    i went back to the doctor who then told me i did not have thrush but had a coated tongue and gave me amoxicillin for the flu and fluconazole because he said he did not want the coated tongue to turn into thrush from the antibiotics.    the medication helped rid me of the flu but the white tongue did not go away.    i have since been to the dentist who believed it was a result of tobacco use and rinsing with hydrogen peroxide which i had been doing.    i have also been to an ent doctor who believes it is a result of acid reflux and prescribed prilosec and has me rinsing with baking soda.    now it has been 9 weeks and none of this seems to be curing my tongue.    the doctors have told me they think it is unrelated to the girl i kissed prior to having the issue and have told me it is not contagous.    i have been tested for all std's and do not have anything so it is not from that, and i have not used tobacco or rinsed with hydrogen peroxide since this all began.to describe the tongue, the papillae are all pretty much white.    if i brush my tongue with baking soda it pinkens it up temporarily but it always goes back to white.    even when it is temporarily pink i can see the outline of where it will turn white again as it looks like there is a slimy coating that cant be scraped off in that area.    it covers the top surface of my tongue from the back where it is very white to the tip where there is more pink areas mixed in with the white.    it is not cottage cheese looking and the papillae are not long and hairy looking either.    any help in answering 1) what this might be, 2) is it contagous, and 3) how can i cure it would be greatly appreciated.thanks    for your help!
3461,i have a two year old who use to be a picky eater.    over the last few weeks he's constantly eating and is never tired.    i know in a growth spurt they eat a lot but i thought they were also suppose to sleep a lot!    i'm just wondering if there's something seriously wrong because he keeps coming out of his room at all hours of the night to say he's hungry.    am i just worrying too much or is there a hidden problem here?    if anyone can help me please do!
3462,just a week before schoold ended for the summer, i cought my 6 yrs old son performing some sex act with a 8 yrs. it happen in my back yard.    on dat day someting told me to look on what they were doing, i was so shock when i saw my son on his knee with pants down and the other boy standing in front my son face with pants down.    i've done what was suppose to be done, call local police, talk to the parents.    but i believe there is more in this story.    police as close the case cause of the boy's being in close age but it involves more then 5 boy's, but yet since then that 8 yrs old now 9 is bullying my son all the time. he calls him the gaylord and so on.    he's always hitting my son. we have told his parent's but nothing has been done.    now that the new schoold year as start my sons has open up to his teacher.    what i saw on that day actually happen more then once, even happen in my house.    i'm mix up dont know what to do but i believe one of those boys is being abuse badly, and the law is not looking into it.    my feeling is very strong there is another boy in trouble if they dont provide proper conselling for those kids they might do it to someone way younger. so what should i do?
3463,i have been experiencing conjunctivitis/redness/light sensitive in the left eye and visited my local gp and was prescribed with some antibotic(antibiotic)eye drops. these drops helped the reddness and irritation go away but in a couple of months later i experience the same problem. it has been a constant problem for about a year now and recently booked in for an eye examination at the optometrist and then was refered to an eye specialist. i was told i have had a lot of immflammation in the eye that has left dots/fluids in the lens which has caused lost of vision, blurriness and enlarged pupil in the left eye.i was prescribed with eye drops (prednefin forte) and rescheduled for another appointment in 3 weeks. i'm not sure what is wrong with me, i have also had a chest x-ray and blood test and results show i am a perfectly healthy 23 year old female.would you be able to tell me what i could have? is it caused by a disease/allergy or damaged due to an object thrown to the eye
3464,hey everyonei am new to this website and i hope i am in the right forum.6 months ago i got diagnosted with pelvic inflammatory disease and was treated for it with antibiotics. ever since i have not had any kind of problems , pain or irritation.but a little over 2 weeks ago i started having a tooth ache and got prescribed antibiotics again - and i noticed that the antibiotics i got prescribed was augmentin (875 mg/ 2 x a day for 10 days). i never took that kind of antibiotics before and was sceptical.3 days into taking those antibiotics i started having a burning, itching sensation in my vaginal area - first just the outside of the vagina. two days later the burning got worse and it affected the inner labia, even the area around the vaginal opening. but i had/ have no vaginal discharge at all.the burning and itching and irritation got so worse that i could barely walk, wearing slips was painful and urinating was too and everything down there was red, sore and swollen and the labia felt rubber-like numb.so i went to the ob/gyn and he told me that this is an yeast infection - most likely caused by the antibiotics.he told me that he could either prescribed an ointment or that i could just go and get the over-the-counter stuff - and i did. got the monistat 1 action pack - and after inserting the ovale thing i noticed that the burning and itching got quite better after two days.yesterday, 5 days later the itching and burning is still there - not as bad as before but still there, and even affected the perineum and anus area. every bowl movement is quite painful - it burns like hell.so i got the vagisil maximum strength creme - and man, i could not take that burn - that was like fire when i put that creme on and i had to take it off immediately. so i started just sitting in the tub with cold water to ease the itch and burn - which helps. not for long, but at least a little.i even noticed that the skin around the vagina and the anus looks reddish, some parts scaly/ flaky like.and i do want to mention that i have psoriasis (affected in palms of my hands, under my feet, legs, elbows, knees, head skin and under my fingernails). and i am concerned that maybe my genital area got affected now with psoriasis.i went back to the ob/gyn and told him about the symptons that are still there - but he said that an yeast infection will take at least 7 days to heal to wait a few more days.but i am really concerned now. it still feels painful when i just walk, every tight clothing causes more irritation and bowl movements/ urinating are a nightmare and at night it rarely lets me fall asleep cause the burn and irritation make it almost impossible to find some rest.i am a single mother and have to take care of my boy all day and being in such a discomfort makes the every day life with a 3 yr old harder than it already is as a single mother.please - if you have any idea what it could be - is it an yeast infection like the ob/gyn said/ thinks - could it be psoriasis (anybody here diagnosed with it?) or something else or where to go to/ whom to seek for medical help - please let me know your thoughts.i am very thankful for taking the time to read my post and wish all of you a great day.neamae

3466,an easy way to do corn on the cob outside.i prefer the bread and butter corn.peel back corn husk and remove silk.place a 1/2 dab of butter on each side of corn.pull husk back over corn.wrap in aluminum foil    (don't worry about some husk sticking out at end)throw into grill while the other food is cooking.another way if camping is to make a pit under night side fire pit.    or place within the sides of coals.taste great.    locks in corn taste.    and keeps you out of the house.    ya.
3467,i fell a few weeks (tripped over an extension cord trying to turn off my morning alarm clock) and took a real blow to my left knee. i don't think it's the kneecap, more like the very upper part of the tibia. the bruising was relatively minor and went away in a few days, but it's the swelling that concerns me -- and the pain.the swelling is not huge, but it goes all the way down to my ankle. the pain, also, is not real horrible, just a nagging ache i try to control with ibuprofen.my concern is how should i treat this injury? i have no health insurance and can't afford a doctor. the free county hospital in my area is more dangerous than no treatment at all (they are currently undergoing a huge investigation and exposure by the media and everything's in an uproar with its chairman resigning, etc. and everybody in my area knows it's a joke to try and get treatment there, anyway).so -- can you advise how i might treat this injury? it's been about three weeks since it happened and i am just wondering how long this might take to get well if i just do what i'm doing, that is, staying off of it as much as i can. i work from home, which helps, but i do have to do absolutely necessary housework-type things like laundry, dishes, changing beds, vacuuming because i'm a single mom (don't laugh, i'm 52 with a 10-year-old son).
3468,for the past ten months i have been experiencing nausea ranging from minor to very intense. not after all meals, but at least once or twice a day after i eat. i kept a food journal in the earlier stages but after i saw no reoccurring pattern between what i was eating i gave up. sometimes the nausea actually causes me to vomit after eating. i have also experienced symptoms of diarrhea multiple times a day. i have even noticed that i am not able to fully digest some foods, including lettuce, carrots, and noodles. the first time i saw my health care professional she thought it might be a reaction to the birth control pills i was one. she suggested i go off birth control to see if it helped, and i did for four months. this did not help at all. i went to see her again recently and she recommended calling a gastrointestinal specialist. i am wondering if anyone knows what this could be as it has become a little worrisome that it has persisted this long without getting better.
3469,i am a stay at home single mom who earns a living by babysitting. my hubby recently left me and i have been feeling so lonely for the past 2 years now. i would like to start feeling good for myself. do you know of a doctor who will prescribe phentermine and b12 shots at an affordable price? i live off of tropicana and rainbow so a clinic nearby would work great for me.
3470,i was fooling around with my boyfriend last night and somehow got a cut on my lip near my vagina. at first i thought it was my period starting early because there was so much blood. but i looked at it in a mirror this morning and it's swollen, and looks pretty deep, and also the skin is looking slightly blueish around the cut. it's still bleeding a little bit and hurts a lot, i don't know what to do!! it's kind of freaking me out, especially since i have no insurance at the moment. if somebody could please help me out and give me suggestions as to what i should do i would really appreciate it!!!!
3471,so i lost my virginity about two months ago now and just started the birth control pill about two weeks ago (12pills ago) when i started the pill i was about to get my period maybe a week or two later but i haven't gotten it i thought maybe it was jst the pill pushing it back. during this we've been having sex. (wth condoms but we had a couple scares wth them) well my boobs have been extreamly sore. i'm a week late for my period am nauseous but thot its because he was hitting my cervix. n now i jst found dark discharge i usually get that before my period but now i'm worried it's spotting. i'm extremely worried ! also i jst took a pregnancy test yesterday and it came back negative. should i take another one ?please help.
3472,william ayersduring the 2008 presidential campaign, reports surfaced that then-candidate barack obama knew and had had limited interactions with fellow chicagoan william ayers, a former member of the weather underground group, which in the 1970s had bombed several government buildings. right-wing bloggers and fox news' sean hannity seized on the story, embellishing obama's contacts with ayers in order to paint him as a radical. obama's relationship with ayers eventually reached a national audience during one of the democratic debates. it wasn't until months later that the media documented obama's largely tangential links to ayers, debunking the right-wing myth.right-wing bloggers attack obama-ayers links. conservative bloggers seized on two media reports to attack obama's links to ayers. on february 15, 2008, bloomberg news reported that obama could face questions about his relationship with william ayers, noting that ayers donated $200 in 2001 to obama's illinois state senate campaign and served with him from 1999 to 2002 on the nine-member board of the woods fund. on february 22, 2008, politico's ben smith reported that in 1995, state senator alice palmer introduced her chosen successor, barack obama, to a few of the district's influential liberals at the home of two well known figures on the local left: william ayers and bernardine dohrn.based on these articles, right-wing bloggers began attacking and distorting ayers' links to obama:* commentary's john podhoretz: but here's a thought experiment. what if john mccain had visited the unabomber's cabin? or had been photographed with terry nichols? or had stopped off at david duke's house at some point because he was gathering support and donors? [obama's ayers, 2/22/08]* stop the aclu: obama does some nice double talk and condemns the actions of the weather underground, however he remains good friends with two of them that remain unrepentant for their actions. [obama's terrorist friends, 2/23/08]* right wing nut house: i am talking about the extent of the candidate's ties to domestic terrorists from the 1960's and how the american people might feel about their future president paling [sic] around with someone who set off bombs as a member of the group weather underground and to this day refuses to apologize for it. [obama and the radicals: soulmates? 2/23/08]* human events' john batchelor: will the four horsemen of mr. obama's november, rezko, ayers, rashidi and auchi, lead to a similar defeat for the spectacular candidacy of barack obama? [the obama files, 2/25/08]hannity picks up ayers story. hannity seized on the ayers story soon after, and mentioned obama's links to ayers on an almost daily basis for weeks afterward.from the february 27, 2008, edition of fox news' hannity & colmes:hannity: bob beckel, i want to ask you about william ayers. if you recall, he admitted that he was involved in the bombings of new york city police headquarters in 1970, the capitol building in 1971, the pentagon in 1972. we have a report out today, abc news via the new york sun that he donated to the obama campaign. we have a report out, that obama visited his home as, quote, a rite of passage when launching his political career in the mid-1990s. his spokesman -- barack obama -- said, yes, they're friendly. they know each other. does the presidential candidate for the democratic party have any business being friendly with and potentially accepting donations from a man that admits that he blew up and helped plan and set a bomb at our pentagon?from the february 28, 2008, edition of hannity & colmes:hannity: there is the issue of this guy from the weather underground, this guy bill ayers. this is a guy that admits to being part of the bombing with the weather underground of the new york city police headquarters in 1970, our capitol building in 1971, the pentagon in 1972. and it was reported by jonah goldberg, who will be here tomorrow night, that as a right of passage, barack obama visited him when launching his political career in the 1990s.when asked about it this week of whether or not they had a friendship, barack obama's spokesperson admitted that, in fact, they were -- that they did have a friendly relationship. this is a guy who is admitting to bombing our pentagon, and was part of a group that declared war on the united states. i'm sitting here thinking as an outsider, if i'm hillary clinton, that's a big issue for the american people in a post-9/11 world.from the march 9, 2008, edition of hannity's america:hannity: william ayers is a guy that was with the weather underground, a group that admitted to bombing our pentagon, bombing our capitol building, bombing new york city police headquarters, said as recently as 2001 he regrets he didn't go further. a group that declared war against the united states.barack obama met with him when he started his political career in the 1990s and he also went on to say about william ayers that he is friendly with him. you look into that camera and you tell me why a presidential candidate should get away with being friends with an admitted terrorist.hannity complains about lack of media coverage. soon after he began flogging the story, hannity began attacking the media for ignoring it.from the april 9, 2008, edition of hannity & colmes:hannity: well, the philosophy -- because they declared war against the united states. and the philosophy was -- the weathermen philosophy was kill all the rich people. ayers summed -- these are ayers' words: kill all the rich people. break up their cars and apartments. bring the revolution home. kill your parents. that's where it's really at. and he's unrepentant.karl rove: right, well, and they attacked -- they attacked, as i recall, police facilities, military facilities, u.s. government buildings. and they did so in a manner without apparent regard for human life.hannity: yes.rove: i mean, i think -- i don't recall that people were killed or injured, but that was not the -- that wasn't the intention. they wanted to create violence and blow things up.hannity: karl, i first interviewed jeremiah wright in march of 2007. and i stayed on the issue. and it took almost a year for the mainstream media to pick up on the story, and it became a big story. do you believe at some point somebody in the mainstream media is going to examine this relationship that barack obama's campaign claims is friendly?from the april 15, 2008, edition of hannity & colmes:hannity: but doug schoen, this is the problem. a new narrative has emerged. and it is michelle obama's comments. it's these comments in san francisco. it's the unrepentant terrorist, bill ayers. we've been covering on this program. the mainstream media has ignored it. it's him attending the million man march. why did he attend the million man march?stephanopoulos talks to hannity, asks obama about ayers. on the april 15, 2008, edition of his nationally syndicated radio program, hannity interviewed abc news' george stephanopoulos, who was set to co-moderate the democratic presidential debate the following day. during that interview, hannity suggested to stephanopoulos that he ask obama about his association with bill ayers, the unrepentant terrorist from the weather underground. hannity continued:hannity: when asked about it by the politico, [obama campaign chief strategist] david axelrod said they have a friendly relationship and that they had done a number of speeches together and that they sat on a board together. is that a question you might ask?stephanopoulos responded to hannity: well, i'm taking notes right now.
3473,yesterday at daycare, my 17 month old bit another child.    didn't draw blood thank goodness, but it was hard enough to leave a mark.    i am continuing with the time outs when he bites or hits, but they are not allowed to use time outs at the daycare, so there is inconsistency.    obviously putting him in time out at home for something he had done much earlier in the day serves no purpose...he wouldn't understand why it was happening.    all they are allowed to use at his daycare is diversion (believe it or not it is the law here..sigh).    i apologized to the other child's parents...i just felt so bad.    they were super nice and said it happens...in fact it seems they are dealing with the same situation with their child.    when he bites or hits it is not aggressive.    he isn't angry or frustrated the majority of the time.    it's like he is playing.    it's concerning because i don't want to see that kind of behaviour and i understand how important it is to end it now.    it's not as frequently as it was, so what we are doing at home is working....at home.    but at daycare there is no real consequence so i guess he thinks it's ok there.    any suggestions for me?    he is still a bit young to reason with obviously, although we do consistently tell him no biting or no hitting.    thoughts?    thanks so much.
3474,since about the end of august/september 2008 i began having issues with reoccuring bv after treating a yeast infection in late july. since then, i have had several reoccuring infections. i became sexually active in november [i was not sexually active prior] and that seemed to trigger another infection. around thanksgiving my gyn prescribed clindesse vaginal cream and the infection seemed to subside for about a week and then it returned. i wasn't able to go back to the doctor for a follow up because i was away at college. in january i went back to the gyn and i took a dose of metronidazole. there was no reduction in symptoms and i'm still having issues with discharge, itching, burning during urination and just general irritation. recently, my right labia has been causing me discomfort while, walking, exercising or just laying down. does this discomfort have anything to do with bv?i don't have a history of any other std/stis, i do have a history of vaginal eczema and i'm currently using the ortho evra patch for contraception. i haven't had sex since december and i'm 19 years old. i've been trying to regularly eat pro-biotic yogurt but nothing seems to help. does anyone have any insight as to how to get rid of bv once and for all? i really don't want to return to the doctor again, but i suppose i'll have to if this doesn't clear up soon.
3475,i started bleeding as i normally do but it only lasted one day. am not on any kind of medication and do not normally have had this happen could i be pregnant
3476,i just lost my virginity about 2 weeks ago . within those two weeks ive had intercourse 1 more time, both times with no protection. i noticed some white clumpy stuff along with clear sticky stuff coming from    'down there ' . this is different than my usual discharge. does having sex have something to do with it? should i be worried ? any idea what this is?please and thank you.
3477,hi i wanted to let everyone that today is 2 weeks and i have lost 14.5 pounds. i really love the clinic in tn they are very suportive. good luck to everyone. i will keep you posted.
3478,i need some info. can anyone tell me why i have an itch on top of my clitoris when i first urinate in the mornings?    it's not coming from sex because i'm not having sex. also, how come i can't have an orgasm unless it's oral?    help me!!!
3479,please can you help.    my nine year old boy, i would say is a typical boy except in school.    he has always been full on in school, has disrupted his class, but this seems to have stopped and academically he is clever, no problems with his work.    he is a very young 9 year old, some of his class are nearly a year older than him.    but the problem is playtime, he doesn't stop to think.    the problem at the moment is there is a boy in his class they say has anger problems and can't help it.    when he hits my son, or calls him names we and the school have told our son to walk away and tell the teachers.    he seems to deal with it himself, doesn't tell the teachers all the time, sometimes when he tells them the reaction is negative.    but he goes over the top.    example today some of his friends really upset him going into his face saying he was rubbish at football, the boy with anger problems did the same and when my son turned away he hit my son in the back, not hard so my son turned round and kicked him hard, when the dinner lady told him to stand by the wall he said no, then another dinner lady tried, he told her no and went and sat down by the railings.    his teacher had to come and get him and told him he had let her down, himself and me.    he said he felt very angry.    he doesn't seem to get walk away.    once he grabbed one of the pupils by the neck because my son thought he was hacked at football when he wasn't, the boy concerned was so upset.    outside of school my son is typical, but excellent manners and people say a credit to me.    please help as i do not know what to do.    the teachers say to my son you know ...... has anger problems and you know better.    so is it right that my son has to put up with being taunted and hit by this boy because he can't help it.    my son is no angel but he has to stop his anger and being disrespectful to adults.
3480,i seem to lie to my spouse for one reason or another.    i seem to do it to avoid conflict but she says i do it around other people as well on little things.    i am trying to stop and am really putting a concerned effort into it.    does anyone have any ideas what the best way to go about this is?    i know i lie to not hear my wife complain or nag but it is leading to martial problems and it isn't big lies but is adding up.    would a conselor help?    what has worked for other people?     i am a good father of 3 and am a good parent, don't drink, gamble and have never cheated on her.thanks for any suggestions.
3481,my 5 year old son has stopped eating solid foods.    he complains that it hurt to swallow and that his adam's apple hurts when he tries to swallow solid food.    he can drink and eat soft food like bread but says that spagetti is too hard and he can't swallow it.    he has been xrayed with no finds and has had a camera scope his throat, also with no abnormalities.    do you have any suggestions as to what may be causing this?    he has not eaten solid food for about 3 to 4 weeks.    we are having him examined further with blood and bowel samples.
3482,can you get pregnant if you have sex 2 days after your menstruation using pull out method?what do you think are the chances?i'm worried co'z i'm new at this. please help.thnx
3483,i had cataract surgery on my second eye yesterday.    tonight i was out walking and noticed the full moon had a clear band of light like a laser beam, exactly the width of the moon, extending diagonally out from the moon down across the vegetation to my left and up across the clouds to my right.    i then noticed that street lights had the same band across them at the same diagonal angle.    i can tip my head and the angle changes accordingly.    the implanted lens in my other eye doesn't and never has done this.    i know something like this effect can be achieved by squinting at a light, but i can't get this to go away.    what's going on?    and will it go away?
3484,about two days after cataract surgery my eyes, which normally tear well felt very dry and very uncomfortable felt like i had worn hard contact lenses too long.    at the same time, i developed laryngitis, an ear ache and sinusitis, which started on the operated side and progressed to encompass my whole head. pain was more pronounced on the operation side feeling like eye strain emanating from the socket, with an occasional fleeting sharp pain which has slowly reduced.my ent did a thorough exam and ended up doing a ct and found no infection and ruled out allergies or a cold.    all along, i had no fever and my sinuses were clear, just an ongoing post-nasal drip.i have been plagued with ear aches in both ears and intense pressure behind both eyes, with throbbing in all all of my sinus cavities.    i had to take antivert when the pressure caused severe dizziness.    i started a short strong regimen of prednisone to alleviate some of the symptoms but even medicated, the area around the eyes feels intense pressure and throbbing. when i awake there is sometimes a feeling of dryness and a low dull pain.all that said, i have no problems with the implant. i see very well with that eye.i don't know where else to go to from here.
3485,i got a tb test on monday and today the spot where i got it is red but there is absolutely no bump. when she gave it to me i think she acedentally cut me with the needle though because it was bleeding much more than my friend's was. it was also a little bit itchy for about 15mins after i got it. the red spot is about a little bit    less than half an inch and round. oh and im 16 and a girl if that matters.thank you :)

3489,i am a kindergarten teacher and i have a student that has been diagnosed with epilepsy.    for the last 4 months i have been trying every trick in the book to help modify this child behavior.    my main concern is he continues to be aggressive to myself and other students, as well as laughs we he is in trouble, asks other students to do something they shouldn't to see them get in trouble and so on. i know that his parents are trying different meds to see what will work best, however, how much of the behaviors are from meds/epilepsy and how much comes from being a kid.    i have worked with all kinds of behaviors over the years (some even worse) however, i have never had a student not react to behavior management plan of some kind.any suggestions?
3490,recently, i was having my regular wash in my bath tub. while cleaning myself, accidentally my middle finger slid in my vaginal hole. it hurt a bit as i had long nails and the insertion was quick and sudden. though i am not a virgin, i am worried that the tissues surrounding my vaginal hole may have been severed. the pain was momentary and felt just like a paper cut. it lasted only for a few minutes. there was a little bleeding though i cannot say whether it was because of that as i was having my periods that time. can this pose a problem in my sex life? can my vagina get loose or something??
3491,any american's come on here will know we celebrate thanksgiving soon, any years i do the cooking i have bought a packet mix of stuffing, would any know a good recipe from ingredients, i have books but i have found its great to get friends input on family recipes, makes it more interesting .,also any veg you make for thanksgiving dinner .
3492,last night i woke to severe, intermittent cramping just above the pubic bone and--to a lesser degree--discomfort in the rectal area. i was unable to sleep the remainder of the night. barely able to straighten up when i got up. had my usual normal bowel movement which helped some. (bowel movement previous day also normal) nothing different in my diet.condition still with me. feel like i need to have bowel movement, but nothing remains to come out. no fever. ideas?i'm an active, healthy 69 yr old female.
3493,many have posted questions in many other forums, however, while scanning through the site, and the forums, it seems the mhi-md's are too busy answering std questions to bother with any others. all the latest questions are being commented on by other users, vs. being answered by the mhi md's.    i think they deserve answers, just as quickly as the std's forum, don't you?not just the weight loss forum, but over 50 unanswered questions in the women's issues forum, over 50 in thyroid, respiratory, and nutrition.    i am wondering why there are only moderators or real q & a on only std and urology???    maybe these are male forums, with male interests, so the others are left behind.    i seriously don't get it. hello? is anyone there?

3496,ok, lastnight me and my girlfriend had sex and she was just ended her period that day or the day before. well my condom broke.. and of    course i was not aware and ejacutlated before i was able to pull out.. shes not on birth controll and shes goin on that plan b.. what are the chances of her getting pregnant and is there anything else that i can do to prevent itt this time..
3497,i gave my girlfriend an oral sex,(last week, saturday) after that i wanted masturbate, so i touched my penis, it had pre-*** with either my right or left hand( but i think its right). then i tried masturbating while standing, but i had a hard time so i just sat down and asked my gf to sit on me. (on my lap, no intercourse happened here) so i could just look at her, so while i was masturbating i was touching her vagina with my left hand then when i ejaculated, it landed on my belly. i avoided touching her already after that. then i went to the sink but i couldn't turn the faucet since i don't want to hold it with a hand with semen. so she opened it for me but i think she touched my hand slightly. anyway she said she didn't touch it anymore after that and washed the next day. (since she was staying in a friend's house after.)anyway next week after that, (this week) she is suppose to have her period this week. but she doesn't have her period now. i was a bit paranoid and asked some questions that are symptoms of pregnancy. she said she is still energetic, she doesn't get that tired easily, yesterday, she had a bigger appetite. no signs of dizziness.she said she gained weight but it was like that before that happened. she thinks her breasts didn't change. only thing is, she doesn't want to have a pregnancy test since she is only 15 and her parents knowing she is trying a pregnancy test. my girlfriend is still a virgin.well my questions are:should i worry about it?are there chances of her getting pregnant?if there are chances, how big? can you give me percentages?thanks :)

3507,we have just been expatriated to hong kong from s.africa. my daughter age 7, seems to have taken to it okay. however her behavior shows major anxiety. won't sleep in her own bed at night, teeth grinding when she is asleep. and has decided to become a vegetarian.she likes her school, however is not the shining star she used to be as the school levels are higher in hk.she is an only child (not by choice!) so she has one on one attention with us, but perhaps not the right attention.how can i get her to talk and verbalise what it is exactly that she feels she is battling with? how can i tell her it's okay to be nervous about new home, life etc. but this is how to handle it.she lost her grandfather 2 months into the move. so life has thrown her a variety of challenges.i feel that all these situations have been chipping away at her. and they manifest themselves in her social behaviour. ie, sudden refusal to eat meat!please advise.... anything at this stage!

3509,i think i may be pregnant, i'm not sure i was a week and a have late on my last period and i have a lot of symptoms but when i took a test it was negative. i'm only 13 and really hope i'm not. but my boyfriend and i didn't have sex he fingered me but that was it. as i said i'm only checking because neither me or him want me to be and i'm really scared incase i am?

3514,i got a very painful sore on my inner lower lip and the doctor said it was probably a cankor sore. within 4 days i got these painful white bumps on my tongue that are almost pus filled. they are all over my upper front tongue and are multiplying. it hurts to have anything cold or hot. i think they are contagious. the sore on inner lip is almost healed but the more that heals the more the bumps/spots on my tongue multiply. i've also been dealing with these sores i get on my body that also have a white root-like core to them and take months to heal. i was told years ago that i have autoimmunity disease and wonder if this is a specific one. i had cbc done and my white blood cell count is high. i've been on multiple antibiotics over the last 3 months but none have helped. i also had a bad staph infection and am concerned the antibiotics did not cure that and it is in my bloodstream but i don't know if that would show up in the mouth like that. i have been very very clean, brushing, rinsing, antibacterial soaps, etc. please help!
3515,i had my lower right wisdom tooth taken out on approximately 2 weeks ago. the flap is healed, the stitches have fallen out or dissolved, and there is no pain in the area. however, my cheek (on my jawline) is still swollen and puffy (not hard, just puffy), as are the gums around the extraction site and the tooth adjacent to the extraction site. when i brush around the wound, the wound itself does not bleed, but the gums beside it do bleed (minimally) and i'm scared. i had my tooth pulled at a dental school and because the tooth was hooked, it took 2 students and 1 os resident over 2 hours to get the tooth out. needless to say, it was a rough surgery. i went back to the dental school for a follow up 5 days after the tooth had come out, and they said it was healing well, they irrigated because it smelled bad, but said there was no need for antibiotics and sent me on my way. they told me that day the swelling should go down within a day or two.now, it's been 12 days and i'm still having these lingering symptoms. also, totally unrelated as it was a lower wisdom tooth that was removed, but i did get a sinus infection a few days ago which has seemingly made the wound taste bad and feel sore when i cough or sneeze - is that normal? i have already talked to the student who did the surgery and she said because it was such a rough procedure my symptoms could last longer, but i'm skeptical. could the site be infected? there is no pain except a general uncomfortable feeling from the swelling.thank you for your help! :)
3516,hope anybody can help?when i am sexually stimilated (not vaginally, i haven't had full sex yet) i usually just have an orgasm and everything is fine!but recently i've been getting shooting pains in and around my vagina only when i orgasm that quickly subside and then the pain totally disappears... you wouldn't have any idea why i'd suddenly have pain like this would you i've had it a few weeks and the pain is getting worse?i've been checked for stis and had nothing, the only problem i've had a few months ago was a bladder infection where there was blood in my urine that was painful when passing water but that is all clear now.any ideas before i go to my doctor?thanks for all your help.
3517,i have a 17 month baby boy and his little penis is completley swolen. the tip is not pink as if he had it irritated. i took him to the hospital and the doctor told me that he thinks he has an infection they gave him cephalexin. he has had this seance about 9:30 am and it has gotten a little more biger seance then. i dont know if i should just go to a different hospital or just take that doctors word for it.
3518,http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-05-22/commentary/31802270_1_spending-federal-budget-drunken-sailorwashington (marketwatch)    of all the falsehoods told about president barack obama, the biggest whopper is the one about his reckless spending spree.as would-be president mitt romney tells it:   i will lead us out of this debt and spending inferno.  almost everyone believes that obama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an   inferno   of spending that threatens our jobs, our businesses and our children  s future. even democrats seem to think it  s true.but it didn  t happen. although there was a big stimulus bill under obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since dwight eisenhower brought the korean war to an end in the 1950s.even hapless herbert hoover managed to increase spending more than obama has.here are the facts, according to the official government statistics:   in the 2009 fiscal year    the last of george w. bush  s presidency    federal spending rose by 17.9% from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. check the official numbers at the office of management and budget.   in fiscal 2010    the first budget under obama    spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion.   in fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion.   in fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the congressional budget office  s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last august.   finally in fiscal 2013    the final budget of obama  s term    spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. read the cbo  s latest budget outlook.over obama  s four budget years, federal spending is on track to rise from $3.52 trillion to $3.58 trillion, an annualized increase of just 0.4%.there has been no huge increase in spending under the current president, despite what you hear.why do people think obama has spent like a drunken sailor? it  s in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal budget.what people forget (or never knew) is that the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and congress. the president only begins to shape the budget in his second year. it takes time to develop a budget and steer it through congress    especially in these days of congressional gridlock.the 2009 fiscal year, which republicans count as part of obama  s legacy, began four months before obama moved into the white house. the major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by george w. bush and the previous congress.like a relief pitcher who comes into the game with the bases loaded, obama came in with a budget in place that called for spending to increase by hundreds of billions of dollars in response to the worst economic and financial calamity in generations.
3519,i went too the er sunday for my feet,and they said it was just athlete's foot.sunday night and now i have swelling in the feet and ankles, does anyone think i have an infecion(infection)? by the way i am a 25yr old male
3520,hi dr.,i am a 21 year old college student with a steady girlfriend of over 6 months. i never really trimmed down below but started to with her because it gave her discomfort. after i shaved and we would have intercourse i get what i believe is genital folliculitis but am not sure. it appears to be ingrown hairs, itches/hurts a little, and only happens when i have sex. they are only on the sides of the base of the penis. i can also feel them starting to form as i have sex. they go away when i do not have intercourse and only come back after a few times of sexual relations. please let me know what they are and how to treat them.
3521,hi,i've been suffering from ekc for teh last four months. i've posted tow question in the same topic in this forum & i'm extremely thankful to the expert comments by the doctors. once more time thanks & lot for the answers.i went to several doctors, but nobody is able to give me a timeline of the approx recovery from all this blurrness problem. can anybody please explain me how long approx it will take to recover. it started with right eye , then it also spreaded to the left eye, although the left eye was recovered faster & no recurrence happened, my right eye has got recurrence    3 times till now, but the intensity has gradually come down. i'm really scared if i'll suffer from any kind of vision loss down the line.
3522,i'm finally scheduled to have my right eye cataract done. my doctor has suggested a toric lens as the right eye has a high amount of astigmatism. i'm a bit wary as my left eye cataract surgery caused a lot of glare problems as my doctor substituted a rezoom lens for the crystalens we agreed on. subsequent yag laser treatment (by a different doctor) in that eye to correct some scarring actually made the glare and halos worse. anyway. i have a new doctor and i'm wondering if the toric is something to worry about, or should i take the safe way out and go for a basic lens.i see 20/30 in my left eye now (uncorrected) and can barely see out of my right eye. if i go for the basic lens, leaving the rt eye clear but the astigmatism not corrected, will i see better or worse than i do now without glasses?????thank you for your answers. jp
3523,i had clear lens exchange 3 years ago.    my day vision is good but night driving is difficult.    now i am reading about alphagen or pilocarpine drops to constrict pupil.    what do you know about this?    i have ask this question about poor night vision and no one said anything about these drops.    is it a good option?
3524,i have a bump on my lower eye lid.    i use to get them all the time.    eventually my whole eye gets swollen and sometimes it spreads to the other eye and its painful.    it starts out as a very small bump and it feels as htough there is an eyelash in my eye. wha tis this? and wat can i do?
3525,so, just wondering who here thinks they are addicted to the computer?? i know id die a slow death if i didnt have me laptop .... between medhelp and facebook, im on here a lot, which i think is ok cause i have nothing else to be doing. i just finished college and have two months before i head away to alaska!!so, anyone else here feel like if they dont get their fix they'll go insane?? lol
3526,i weigh approximately 205lbs, and am 40 years old.    i have been overweight now for about 17 years (the age of my oldest child...) and decided that i can no longer stand to be this heavy.    i am 5'4, and i would like to weigh about 125-ish.    my issue is this:    i am a classic undereater who tends to binge because i'm starving.    the binging may have only been once a week.. or twice a week, but apparently it was enough to keep me in this state of fat.since deciding to journal my food intake over a month ago, i have noticed that i barely break the 1200 calorie mark almost every day.    keep in mind i am not trying to starve.. i am eating what i consider to be healthy; a lot of fresh veggies, and a lot of lean protein with a few healthy carbs mixed in.    i haven't had but maybe one sugary or fatty snack in over a month.this is a typical day for me:breakfast:2 egg whites or 1 boiled egg, pear/apple, coffee or waterlunch:2-3 small cucumbersgarden salad with 2-3 tbs. of dressingtuna (1 can or pouch) plain1 can (2 servings) of healthy choice soupdinner:this will vary, but often does not exceed 300 caloriesi am averaging 1100-1200 calories a day, and for the life of me cannot understand why such a deficiency isn't creating more of a weight loss.    i understand that at my weight, in order to maintain 200+lbs, i should consume approx. 2700 calories/day.    i have now restricted drastically with little to no results.    in my estimation, i should be losing at least 3lbs a week.    i have also been moderately exercising when my work schedule allows.    can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong?    i am making healthy food choices, and cutting calories.    this with added exercise for nearly a month should be fairly effective, but it's not.    what am i doing wrong?
3527,my son who is just 3 is the most anoying child ive met he does not listen to e or his dad everything is always no and trying to tell us what to do he hits bites spits screams and shouts i am at my whits end with him i can not control him please help me
3528,my son and several friends were introduced to some fairly explicit sexual material about 1 year ago by a same-sex friend of the same age who apparently was introduced to this material by older boys.when this incident originally happened we took immediate action by explaining that this behavior was unacceptable and inappropriate. we conferred with the other parents involved and set fairly strict rules governing their play time together. no bedrooms, no closed doors, etc.it has been one year and we were feeling pretty comfortable that this was nipped in the bud.    however, this week we found out that our son and another boy from the original group were involved in this behavior again. they show eachother their private parts and apparently encourage erections.my husband and i, as well as the other boys parents are completely freaked out. we have talked with our son extensively, but is this enough? should we seek counseling? i don't want my son to think we have labeled him as a freak.as a side note: my son also suffers from anxiety (depression and ocd run in his father's side). we do not know which child initiated contact. our son told us it was the other boy, but we aren't sure what to believe. help!!!
3529,i keep searching for answers!!    sinus lift of january - still have the abscess like swelling on the gumline and am finding that when i get any type of exertion the sinus is worse, any bouncing as in a vehicle on a rough road, an atv which bouces when driving or even a fast walk.    heavy housework such as vacuuming or mopping disturbs the sinus - i am at wits end.    have sent a message to an oral surgeon twice asking for an appointment but never heard back even tho the site says they check messages three times a day.    perhaps he doesn't want to get involved in a second opinion!!?    help and advice again???    the whole side of my face hurts today.        thanks
3530,there are several folks stating vegetarian diet is good for hbsag. can anyone comment on what is good and what is bad ?

3532,is it normal to occasionally see stars in peripheral vision after rising suddenly from a warm bath, or after a an intense series of sit ups. the star flashes only lasted a few seconds. i have fairly high myopia (-6 in one eye, -7 in the other), and several floaters. i had a full retinal exam from a retinal specialist in january- he said everything looked fine. these star flashes do not happen very often- 1 brief episode tonight, the last time was probably last august, and they never last more than a few seconds. also- i only saw the flashes in one eye (the stronger eye).chris
3533,i had a tooth pulled today and learned about dry socket. is there anything i need to know to help me not get it that isnt easily available from google?
3534,i am always in the mood... like right now, and i have a boyfriend who satisfies me, very well, we had sex not even 12 hours ago, and then we had sex a few hours before that. so, i'm wondering... what the hell is wrong with me?!?!?!?
3535,report noted healed right orbital    fracture but nothing about how my eyeball is bulging & that's been one of my biggest complaints in the past few months especially...
3536,i've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for two years now. we've lived together for one. i knew he had struggled with addition previously when he was younger, but thought he was staying clean and sober. about 8-9 months ago, he confided in me that he had relapsed and was back to snorting pills. i told him to go back to live with his aunt for a few days while deciding what i wanted to do. when he agreed to stay clean, i allowed him to come home. from what i've seen, he's been clean.. but, while he was at work this evening he got an email from someone whom he'd asked if they had any oxy, heroin, or roxies. i confronted him via text message just expressing i was upset, thinking he had been doing good these past few months. we just moved into our second apartment after a rough first year (financially) and i just wonder if this is all a waste...of course i love the kid, but hell, i'm nineteen years old. there's a million boys out there for me.. i even started talking to one on and off.. i just don't know if staying with him is worth it. do opiate addicts ever get clean? i know my best friend has watched her father struggle since her birth twenty years ago... every time i suggest he get professional help he argues with me, saying it doesn't do anything, or he can't afford it. i know it's mostly him not admitting he's that bad.. or wanting to quit maybe, but if i could get him to go, is there any hope?i have this idea in my head that once he grows up a little, he'll be better.. or if he could get a steady, well paying job and maybe start college, he'd be busy enough.. maybe it's all wishful thinking, i don't know. i'm so tired of wondering what if constantly. my family hates him for his habits, so i can't talk to them about it..any comments, concerns, ideas, or opinions are greatly appreciated.
3537,hii am a 23 yo male . i want to know if there is any exposure to std risk involved in deep kissing    - involving tounge ? do stds spread thru saliva?
3538,i have a 7 year old foster son whom still wets the bed at night. for this he wears a pull up. however the problem that concerns me is that he occassionally wets his pants during the day. this will happen both at home and school, and at least once a week on average. when questioned its because he didn't want to stop what he was doing to take time out for the toilet. he could be watching tv, playing video games, crafts at school or playing with friends. i can understand maybe the playing with friends and it getting to excited to want to stop and go use the facilities. however; its the watching tv or playing video games at home and just urinating on himself as well as whatever hes sitting on, the floor, beanbag or sofa that i don't understand. surely he knows hes peeing on himself. also he doesn't get up to change until hes told to. we have rewarded and punished by taking away what it was he was doing during the accident (such as if he was playing games during the incident the game is taken away for a short time). we have purchased a special watch that vibrates the wrist to alert him its toilet time and its set for 6 different times throughout the day, as well as remind him verbally to use the toilet. this worked for a very short time, but now we're back to the same ole thing. we don't yell or get angry but this is getting very frustrating. what can be done for this lack of responsibility and self control.
3539,hi guys. i am 19 years old male. i was in relationship from 3 months with my girlfriend. it was my first relationship and it was her 4th relationship. i was seriously honest to this relationship and i love her like anything and i would do anything for her because my love was never fake. but like we say there are lot of fights in relationships. we use to fight all the time on phone. we use to meet like every two days from the start of our relationship. and when things went wrong she we stopped. the thing is i was always concerned about her past relationships and i seriously became upset because of her past relationships. than i asked my friends and cousins about this they said you should stop talking about her past as long as she is in relationship with you at this time. than slowly i stopped taking about her past. i always use to say things like you use many socials sites stop using it or stop talking to your friends that were friends of her ex. because it really hurts me when she does that. i know it is my first relationship but i just want it to be the last, she always use to say i am going to marry you and even i was serious about her and i also wanted to marry her. but than things went wrong again. i starting abusing her about her all because of the fights. i used really bad words like prostitute. i called my girlfriend character less girl. who changes her boyfriend and who doesn't care. after all than misunderstanding she broke up with me. she started hating me, she said i don't want to see you or anything. we were about to join a collage together and she said that don't join the same collage with me because it will ruin your future as well as mine. it really hurt-ed me. i know i was wrong, but seriously my love is not that week that it can end in 3 months. its not a joke to end a relationship. i seriously don't know what should i do. a lot of people suggest me but i seriously cant do anything. i stooped eating food, i stopped going outside and even stopped hanging out with my friends that much as i use to before. all my day goes in depression. all the time i think about her, she is not getting off my mind. i love her like anything and i want to be with her forever. whenever i call her she reminds me the words i used against her, she says what are you going to do to have a girl like me, i am a prostitute right, so why you are calling me again. i just don't want to be in relationship with you. i just want to say single. she said i don't have feelings for you now even that hurt-ed me a lot. how can her feelings go just a week. is that called love. i am dieing without her. i just want to be with her. please people someone help me in this case. i seriously want her back.

3542,they were discovered by taliban operatives on sunday and stoned to death in front a crowd of about 150 men, aqyar said. he said the woman was brought out and stoned first, then the man a half an hour later.'it is against all human rights'aqyar decried the punishment, which he said was ordered by two local taliban commanders.it is against all human rights and international conventions, said spokesman mabubullah sayedi. there was no court. it was cruel.amnesty international said it was the first confirmed stoning in afghanistan since the fall of taliban rule in the 2001 u.s.-led invasion.it called the stoning a heinous crime that showed the taliban and other insurgent groups are growing increasingly brutal in their abuses against afghans.amnesty international has warned that the afghan government should not sacrifice human rights, particularly the rights of women and minorities, in the name of reconciliation with the taliban and other insurgent groups, the london-based rights group said.a taliban spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.the ancient practice of death by stoning has been abandoned in all but a handful of countries. it is still a legal punishment in some countries, like iran, which justify it under shariah, or islamic law, although human rights activists say the quran never specifically prescribed stoning for adultery.last month, iran's religious authorities called off the planned stoning of a woman convicted of cheating on her husband. sakineh mohammadi ashtiani's sentence    which would have been iran's first stoning since 2008    was lifted following a campaign by politicians, rights groups, diplomats and celebrities around the world.copyright 2010 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
3543,i'm a very concerned mother. my son , 7yrs old is worrying me. his behavior at times is the    the same as a 4 yr old. (very innocent) , he doesn't have any malice.lately he is been constantly asking me , right during shower time    for school (7am), if i ever had a bully when i was little. i do remember being bullied during my 7th grade by another girl. luckily i did not allowed that to go any further, because i told my teacher and the bullying stopped.my concern is basically that i feel my son is having some type of problem at school, he seems very insecure at times, if someone hits him he would come to me crying instead of defending himself and that makes me very insecure as well , because when i ask him what happenned, he would start making up fantasy stories , i.e.( i would ask... so tell me what did you do to that kid , the one bothering you, did you tell the teacher?, and he would respond...(no, i turned into a blue power ranger and beat him up).... basically these are the type of comments i would get back from him . it makes me feel that he is not up to the level of a regular 7 yr old.am i right? or am i over reacting?    and is    this is just a phase he is going through?i have already made an appointment with his teacher to talk about my concerns, and i'm also even considering having him evaluated by psychologist.
3544,i have a 9 year old almost 10 who experiences sudden outbursts of anger like a volcano.    he runs from authorities when they request they go with them, but this anger seems to dissipate anywhere from 5-15 minutes after the episode.    most of the time this behavior is seen at school.    he has been suspended several times from 4th grade because of it.    he will just suddenly blow up at another student for something that he didn't like and will sometimes lash out at them.    it's never the same thing that sets him off.    he has also threatened other students with words and is recently starting to display signs of wanting revenge on every one.i just had another meeting with the school principal, vice principal, social worker, behavior coordinator and teacher.    he was diagnosed with adhd and odd when he was younger, 5 i think.    i feel that he was misdiagnosed and the school social worker agrees with me.    i am a single mom and have been for 8 years, i am not working and am afraid that once i get a job i will lose it because the school continuously calls me to come get him.    i requested that and iep be done, which they agreed to.    i have had him on the concerta for his adhd and it made his volcanic mood swings more extreme.    he has been off of them for 2 years and is currently taking evening primrose oil 1000mg once a day...it seems to help a little but i am at my wits end and don't know exactly who to turn to for help.which is the best type of professional to take him to, so that he can be reassessed to find out what is really happening? i'd like to stick to natural alternatives, not synthetic drugs.    and, are there any real successful anger management for children programs available?
3545,dr oyakawa,i spent some time to play with the alcon toric calculator and i think i understand a little more. i found some thing a bit strange and like to get help from you.i tried some k number to give a little bigger corneal astigmatism than i have and assume the small incision is in the steep axis and my doctor thinks that make sense to have the corneal more round.the alcon calculator suggest me the following without using the toric lens and with 0.86 d residual astigmatism.pre-op corneal astigmatism: 1.13 d x 90 surgically induced astigmatism: 0.40 d x 0 crossed-cylinder result (corneal plane): 0.73 d x 90 anticipated residual astigmatism: 0.73 d x 90 i also don  t understand why the alcon toric calculator doesn  t suggest a toric lens as it seems adding a t3 at 90 deg can reduce the residual astigmatism. is there any rule of thumb (like residual astigmatism is less than 0.9d) that a toric lens will not be used    ??if i move the incision location to 60 deg (this is just trial and error), the alcon calculator suggests using the toric lens and with the following result and less residual astigmatism:acrysof  iq toric iol sn6at3iol spherical equivalent (se) 21.0 daxis of placement 100 cylinder power (iol plane) 1.50 dcylinder power (corneal plane) 1.03 dpre-op corneal astigmatism: 1.13 d x 90 surgically induced astigmatism: 0.40 d x 150 crossed-cylinder result (corneal plane): 0.99 d x 100 anticipated residual astigmatism: 0.04 d x 10 comparing the 2 scenarios, it seems the 2nd is much better as the residual astigmatism magnitude is smaller. isn  t it? or the other factors need to be considered like the axis of astigmatism, the shape of the corneal, the complication of having a toric lens ?

3550,i have a patient who resides in a nursing home (snf).    on hospice with cancer of colon.    he fell and fractured his hip.    he underwent an orif.    while hospitalized remained on service (routine level of care) because the fall and fracture were unrelated to his hospice diagnosis.    has now returned to nursing home.    the nursing home informed us (the hospice) that the patient would be getting part a pt and ot.    i informed them that billing for skilled rehab under part a is not permitted.    they would have to bill part b.    the facility told me that this is a rare special circumstance which allows both hospice and a nursing home to bill part a.my question is who is right?    if the nursing home is correct can you tell me where to find this specific information.thanks

3552,my 5 year old has recently started being defiant i guess you could say, he will not listen to me or his father when telling him to stop a certain behavior.    he instead talks back and tries to tell you how he is going to do it.    we have tried time out, spanking, taking things away and he smiles or snickers to himself.    when he doesn't like what you have said to him he gets angry at times raising his voice.    we have noticed it doesn't matter if we are talking loud or soft to him he just doesn't respond to our demands.    he is very loving and has a great memory.    he constantly tells us he loves us, is this just part of being a 5 year old and a stage that he is going thru or have we as parents missed something along the way.    he won't go to sleep unless we are upstairs and it can be way past his bedtime, but yet he is up and ready to go early.     he will go to sleep at 10 even though his bedtime is 830 and then gets up with us at 545 to get ready for the sitters.    he tears up things in his room, says he doesn't like the pictures anymore or it broke on its own.    we have a 4 month old and he loves him and likes to play with him and feed him, so i don't feel like this is the problem.    any help would be great!    i love my son and want him to show respect to us and behave appropriately.

3558,so i baby sit a 3 yr old boy... i dont know if there is something wrong with him ie: mental disability? but he pees his pants, and yes i understand children have accident, but its so much an accident when he pulls his pants down and pees on my carpet oir my childrens toys. or even worse his own brothers head.he says its cuz he has to go. i keep asking him if he needs to pee and he says no everytime them goes to the bathroom and pees his pants( to me this is no accident) my oldest son who is 5 does not care fir this child and he says its because he is handicap. so question 1: can kids sense a disability? question 2: why would he be doing this? he says he likes comeing here, and he like my kids, and his mom says her does not do this at home, but just found out recently that the other day, he did pee on the floor at home. the mom was blaming it on my kids at first being mean to him, but her has never said my kids are bothering him in anyway...i am getting quite frusterated with another kid ruining my husbands and my hard earned things and my kids toys.

3566,does anyone know of disorders and or diseases that are genetic? it appears to be based on autoimmune disease or disorder (hypersensativity to infections) that result in cns/demylenating disorder/disease.i started with overload of infections and lead to cns/demylenating disorder - see neuro    on tues -hopefully has some answers although last time i saw him (6 months ago)    i    was not aware of cns/neuro involvement and my son recently started with infection battle (when he was younger had gone through 15 ear infectionns and found out he had neuro immune deficiency.it seems odd that all three of us are following a very simular path. cousins on my father's side have also battled the overload of infections.our paternal grandmother had poliarteritis nodosa, however i have been told that you can tell just by looking at a person whether they have this or not because of the effects on the skin. she passed away at 51.would reallly appreciate anybody's input or anything simular to this type of    family linked illness based on infections sensativity followed by cns/neuro implications.sinceerelymixedblessings
3567,while your thyroid conditions can make it more challenging to lose weight, losing weight is entirely possible and an undertaking that is best done among the caring and nurturing support of friends.    these friendships, like you have and continue to develop in this community, can provide the support and motivation to move forward together as a group to meet your goals.    for the most part, successfully losing weight for the long term, means we need to address what we eat, why we eat, what emotions may be involved and our activity levels.after being morbidly obese at 330 lbs, i began a natural weight loss program of selecting healthy foods ... lean meats, whole grains, fresh fruits & vegetables and low-fat dairy.    my attitude changed to one of belief and can do and physically i began to move.please know that you can do this!!!!     we begin by taking baby steps and making small changes.    start by setting small goals of 3 lbs, 5 lbs and no more than 10 lbs, reach that goal and celebrate it!!!    those successes are our building blocks that prove to us that we can do this and it provides the motivation and confidence to continue on your journey.    it doesn't come off overnight, but it is not supposed to.    it didn't go on that way either.i never could have thought of my total goal of 176 lbs, however, by setting and reaching a 3 lb goal, celebrating, setting a 5 lb goal, celebrating and never giving up, i have now lost a total of 152 lbs!would absolutely love to have all who are interested join us in the weight loss & dieting community.    we're a fairly small group but we are growing and wonderful things are happening.    there is a wealth of knowledge in the members and we have some exciting things coming very soon!!!    you won't want to miss out on them!!!    why not join us there, get your weight trackers in place and give us the unique privilege to share your journey with you????    we promise to be kind, caring, considerate and provide a positive and accepting atmosphere as we all move forward together.    there is strength in numbers and, as members of the thyroid community, perhaps we can work to make some special posts and provide information that speaks directly to your concerns.i'm starting a discussion for the thyroid members who wish to join.    please come and introduce yourselves.    we truly hope you'll give us the honor of your presence!!!great biggggg supportive hugggssss!!!    ranae
3568,(cnn)    a majority of americans say presumptive gop presidential nominee mitt romney should release income tax information beyond the two years he's already disclosed.the usa today/gallup survey showed 54% of those surveyed felt romney should release tax returns from additional years, compared to 37% who said romney should not release more returns.romney has released his tax return from 2010, and an estimate for his 2011 information. he filed for an extension on submitting his taxes in april, and has vowed to release the full return when the documents are finalized and filed.democrats, and some republicans, have urged romney to disclose more of his tax information. democrats say additional returns will clear up questions about offshore accounts and his rate of income tax, while republicans say it would be politically advantageous to disclose more information. president barack obama's campaign immediately blasted out the poll thursday as an indication their campaign push is working.in thursday's poll, 30% of self-identified republicans said romney should release more of his returns, compared to 75% of democrats and 53% of independents who said the same.the survey also showed respondents were divided on whether or not the tax return information was relevant to the campaign. forty-seven percent said having more tax return information from romney would be largely irrelevant to making a decision at the voting booth, compared to 44% who said the returns would provide legitimate information that helps voters make better decisions.the gallup/usa today poll was taken by telephone on wednesday from 539 adults. the sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.source: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/19/poll-shows-americans-want-to-see-romneys-tax-returns/

3572,http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/clinton-testify-benghazi-jan-23-012132418--politics.htmlsecretary of state hillary clinton will testify jan. 23 before the house foreign affairs committee about the sept. 11 attack on the american compound in benghazi, libya, the panel  s chairman said late monday. the terrorist assault claimed the lives of the u.s. ambassador, chris stevens, and three other americans.  i appreciate secretary clinton  s desire and willingness to testify before the committee as we continue to examine this deadly terrorist attack in an effort to ensure that nothing like it happens again,   republican rep. ed royce of california said in a statement.  my intention is for this hearing to focus on why this attack was not better anticipated, what leadership failures at the state department existed, and what management deficiencies need to be corrected in order to better secure our diplomatic facilities abroad and protect our diplomats serving in them,   royce said.   it is important to learn all we can about what happened in benghazi because at the end of the day, it could happen again. after all, al-qaeda plans attacks over and over again.  clinton had been slated to testify in december, but she suffered a concussion after a fall linked to an illness and had to reschedule. she is due to step down as the top american diplomat, and president barack obama has nominated democratic sen. john kerry to succeed her. he is expected to win easy confirmation by the senate.republicans have criticized the obama administration  s handling of the attack for months, notably in the aftermath of a report that showed the state department set aside requests for greater security at the compound in benghazi. some have also accused the administration of deliberately misleading the american public by linking the assault to protests against an internet video that mocks islam; there was no such demonstration outside the facility before the attack.the controversy led obama  s ambassador to the united nations, susan rice, to withdraw her name from consideration to succeed clinton. and republican sens. john mccain, lindsey graham and kelly ayotte have vowed to question obama  s nominees for key national security posts about whether the administration could have prevented the tragedy in benghazi.

3574,i've been with my boyfriend for a year in half, when i first met him i was not attracted to him. but i knew he was a nice guy and he was very different from the thugs i was used to dating, so i gave him a chance. i just turned 30 so i figured i needed to step out of my comfort zone and try somehing new. as the relationship progressed i got to know him an found out that he was a really nice southern family guy with respect....he lost his business 9 months ago, so money is looking funny. i picked up a second job because i was used to him giving me leisure money, so that my paycheck was    just for bills. he hasn't found a job yet and its putting a strain on our relationship. now i found out that he's a liar...the business he had wasn't even his. he was just the manager. and he constantly keeps lying about his finances.    what should i do?

3576,i noticed the same day i shaved, after sex my vaginal area was very sore. after inspecting myself i found two little cuts one on both sides of my vagina. i figured it was only from shaving. while showering when i went to wash it, it seemed as though it was swollen and raw because it sort of burned when the soap hit it and that never happens. when i pee it burns the little cut but then i also noticed some vaginal discharge that didnt look quite normal. it's white and at first it's like thick but liquid like and then it gets clumpy and thick, it doesn't really have an odor but i am pretty concerned about this.

3579,hi,i had two fixed bridges installed two months ago (over my front teeth) . the sensitivity is improving, but when i lay down at night, i have bad headaches and toothaches. the pain often goes to my jaws.    i have seen my dentist twice about it: the first time, he took x-rays and he said that a 'ligament was widening' which may have precipitated an abcess(abscess). i hadn't been using the sensitivity toothpaste regularly so he instructed me to use it more often and continue flossing, etc, and come back in 2 weeks. i left and the pain continued, even with the toothpaste.    i went to the er and a doctor prescribed penicillin and tramadol. i finished the penicillin, went back to the dentist yesterday and he said my x-rays look better. he slightly adjusted my bite on one side and said the contact may have been causing the pain. if the pain continues, he recommends that i get a root canal. i respect his professional opinion, but i am not comfortable making that decision yet. if i don't have an abcess(abscess)and my bite is correct, what is causing the pain? will a root canal help? i am hesitant to go through the pain and expense of a root canal if it might not work. could it be a tmj issue? any help is appreciated. thank you.
3580,i am 44 years old and recently had cataract surgery in my right eye.    the lense is a monofocal and set for distance. in my left eye i have a +2.5 contact lense that i wear that helps me see for both distance and close up. without the contact in my left eye my vision is best about 15 inches out.    i spend a lot of time on the computer and reading for work purposes and would love to be able to wear reading glasses so i don't have just one eye reading all the time.    i asked my surgeon about getting reading glasses and he advised that i would probably not be happy with them due to the differences between the two eyes. his nurse suggested i buy some glasses at the dollar store and pop out one of the lenses to see how my vision was. she was correct. they gave me a sense of double vision. why is that?    any alternative suggestions for me?
3581,my daughter is 9 yrs old and she is a straight a student in school she does so well with everything that she participates in at school, afterschool programs and camp but at home she the total opposite i have to get on her about keepin her room clean and she's starting to lie about little things and i tell her there's no reason for the lies because all you do is make the situation worse. she claims to always forget certsin things i say but i ithink she has selective hearing ( i listen when i want...) i work 2 jobs 1 full and 1 part so during the week after i get off work we're together and then on saturday and sunday she's with my partner, when i come home we may go to the mall or the movies or maybe out to eat. we make sure that our daughter has everything that she need's and wants and i'm starting to think that we may be over compensating because she's an only child. what's happening to my daughter just last year we did'nt have these problems. is it a phase or it part of the growing pains process.

3592,ok not sure if this is in the right place but here goes.last week i went to my first spinning class. the next day i had sore muscles (as i had thought i would, it being my first time). i went to my second class 2 days after my first - still with sore muscles but thinking it would help. well, it didn't. the second class was yesterday and for the rest of the day, and also today, i have not been able to walk well, bend my knees, lift my leg (mainly my right leg). the muscles in the front of my thigh are in agony. i have been resting, taking ibuprofen and applying bengay to my thighs and i am just about able to move around. is there anything else i can do to help relieve the pain? should i make a doctor's appointment or am i doing all i can? when will i start to feel some relief??i really did enjoy the classes and would like to continue but this pain is worse than any exercise related muscle pain i've had before. i don't want to go back until after my muscles have healed, but i'm worried that the same thing will happen if i go back when i'm feeling better.

3595,i usually weigh around 190 lbs. 5'10. 33 yrs old. i workout hard. very in shape. the last 5-6 months, i've lost around 15-20 lbs. but it seem's like weight i don't want to lose. my diet hasn't really changed. i'm also, feeling a little weaker. and i want to gain it back. the only thing i can think of... is, that i have been under alot of stress. worrying too much. thinking too much. all that kind of stuff. is it possible this could just all be stress related? or are there any types of health problems (off the top of your head) that could cause this. i know this probably sounds vain. but i'm really noticing loss of thickness around my shoulder's, chest, back, and other muscular areas. i'm just wondering what is wrong. i'm not doing any cardio, in hopes to help. i even mix up my routine, to trick my muscles. i take a multi vitamin, magnesium, vitamin e, omega 3, and try to keep up my protein intake. anything you can tell me, or suggest, would be a great help at this point. i want to gain my weight back. i'm getting very concerned. thank you.

3599,hii broke the outer half of an upper molar (filled) some years ago and did nothing about it. the break was above the gum line. it gave me no trouble.    recently i have noticed an occasional very slight headache on the same side of my head and very faint sensitivity in my cheek.    the broken tooth is very briefly sensitive to hot and cold.    it is not sensitive to pressure or discoloured.i visited a new dentist who examined and drilled the tooth.    he then placed a temporary white filling and told me to return in 4 days for root canal treatment.    he did not take an x ray.i am currently in no discomfort whatsoever.    is it likely that i need root canal treatment?    i am reluctant to undergo this if not strictly necessary.many thx

3603,hi,i have, for lack of a better explanation, a dent in my scleras. it looks as if one side of the eyes (the sclera side near the nose) is caving in. i had a pressure test done and my pressures were 17 and 16 (dont remember which measurement for each eye it was) so i dont think its hypotony. i have a history of a left frontal lobe fracture which created a fracture from my left orbital rim down the back and to the left of my cheek with possible mucousal thickening in my ethmoid sinuses. this  indentation is occurring in both eyes, accompanied by pain. as time goes on the indentation keeps getting worse and im afraid this indentation will reach my pupil and distort my vision. my ocuplastic surgeon denied seeing it while my cornea specialist said he could see these deformities. i have sever eye pain, dry eyes, and white mucus (coming from my sinuses?) that forms at the corners of my eyes throughout the day and burns. antibiotics and steroids haven't worked however the steroids reduced the pain. my question is what specialist should i see, and if this could be some kind of disease at the molecular level. please advise me on what i should do!!! thank you.
3604,i wanted to ask that are deaf and dumb problems genetic. because i want to marry a gal whose mom is deaf and dumb.. and she is deaf and dumb and is in the third generation. and her gal whom i wanna marry will be in fourth generation. the girls maternal uncle and grandfather also had the same problem of being deaf and dumb. so would this problem harm or continue in the next generation. i mean our children can also face the deaf and dumb problem.

3607,my 3 year and 7 month child does not speak clearly so far. he feels problem in expressing himself. one year back doctor suggested that he is mentally slow. what should i do?
3608,i had bariatric surgery almost 5 years ago (subtotal gastrectomy only) and shortly afterward discovered that it seems to have unmasked achalasia. i surmise that i had this condition since birth, with repeated hospitalizations for removal of objects that got stuck in my esophagus until age 11 when i had a dilation and symptoms subsided enough that i did not have to be hospitalized again...still occasionally choked on food but eventually it passed through. the condition was never explained to me probably because of my age when most events happened.when i decided to have bariatric surgery i even requested the surgeon dilate a esophageal stricture, which he did during the surgery. subsequently i have had worsening achalasia symptoms, have seen motility specialist and got the diagnosis and started to learn more. without going in to more details, it has become necessary for me to have surgery to correct the achalasia. my question is what special considerations are there for me having a heller myotomy, since i have virtually no stomach remaining (just a 60 or so cc tube-stomach). are there very many instances of this surgery being done after subtotal gastrectomy? what problems might arise (above and beyond normal surgically related problems). are there any case series of people in my situation in the medical literature that i might read? would my potential outcome or risk be substantially different from someone with a normal stomach?am i asking the right questions? are there other questions i should be asking when i find a potential surgeon? is there someone in the san francisco bay area with substantial expertise in both bariatric surgery and the gi surgery i need?
3609,hello,i'm a 19 year old female who has been having mysterious vaginal pain for about a year. i had never had sex until last year with my boyfriend. we were both virgins and so we started off without using condoms. i kept pushing for it but every time we did use one i felt a burning sensation. it took me awhile to realize what was happening. it wasn't until i threw him across the room and felt like someone had poured acid on me did i think i might have a latex allergy. i burned for 4 days and on the 5th day i broke out into hives all down my back, bottom and back of my legs. since then i have not been able to have sex without extreme burning. it got to a point where i would break out into tears while we had sex. i've been to gynecologist who assumed i wasn't using lube which i have been. i found a sight about vaginismus and it seemed similar. with mental work i have made it easier to have sex but i still am so dry even with lube. i burn after and have to wash myself immediately. i swell up and going to the bathroom feels like someone just slice me open down there. i have been checked for everything under the sun. at least 6 times within the last year all coming back normal. i get yeast infections a lot though and an intense dryness that just wont go. i went to a doctor and i have been given three different types of vaginal steroid cream none which have helped if anything they made my skin more sensitive. i have been using a vitamin e cream but it hasn't seemed to help much. my boyfriend is scared to touch me now and i am terrified for him to touch me. i recently went on antidepressants which the depression i think has come from this a lot but i feel as though i have gotten dryer more recently. i can't live like this. i burn after any sexual act and i become in flamed. i have had latex testing and it has all come back negative but they believe i am allergic still. i live in canada and could go to a doctor if i could find on that really wanted to help me. please someone, anyone. a doctor please please help me give me a clue i am desperate to understand what is happening with me. tell me what to do how to fix this i just need something anything to manage this.    thank you.

3614,california became the sixth state in the nation to take an official stand against citizens united v. federal election commission, a 2010 supreme court ruling.one of the largest states in the nation took an official stand thursday against the supreme court's 2010 decision in citizens united v. federal election commission, which ruled that government restriction of corporation or union spending on political campaigns violated the first amendment right to free speech.california joins hawaii, vermont, rhode island, maryland and new mexico in calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn the supreme court ruling.state assembly members bob wieckowski (d-calif.) and michael allen (d-calif.) introduced the campaign finance reform bill in january, calling for the federal government to send a constitutional amendment overturning citizens united to all the states for ratification. the measure also would serve as an official symbol of california's disagreement with the ruling.in an email to the huffington post, wieckowski emphasized california's status as a trendsetter in the fight for campaign finance reform. a lot of national movements and trends start in california, wrote wieckowski. we have the largest population, the most congressional representatives and the largest economy in the country. it was critical for california to take a stand.the last constitutional amendment was ratified in 1992. when asked about the quixotic nature of his resolution, wieckowski agreed that the fight for campaign finance reform was a challenge.no one is underestimating how difficult it is, and justifiably so, to amend the constitution, said wieckowski. but being silent is worse. failing to speak out, to organize, to hold rallies and to take action would be much worse.that  s how you bring about change in this country. by going to city hall, the state capitol and making your voice heard and shining a light on the issue.the moment citizens united was first decided in 2010, mary zhu, a retired physician from davis, calif., joined other local activists to make phone calls, write letters and sign petitions against the ruling under the organizing umbrella of the non-profit public citizen.together with occupy davis, zhu and her friends were able to push the davis city council to endorse wieckowski's bill in february. now that she's part of a successful statewide effort, to condemn citizens united, zhu has no doubt that grassroots activism nationwide will eventually overturn the ruling.california is big and powerful, and this resolution will give tremendous encouragement to other groups, zhu said to the huffington post. it's like a stone that gets thrown in the pond; the water ripples far and wide.when asked about bipartisan acceptance of large donations in the post-citizens era, zhu was realistic about how both republican and democratic candidates benefited. it's the game, and they're stuck in it. i can understand why obama has to go along with it -- 'you don't bring a knife to a gunfight', zhu said.but to zhu, the politicians' conundrum also underscored the importance of her work as a private citizen. we citizens, who have nothing to gain and everything to lose -- it's our job to start screaming loud and clear. this resolution is just the beginning.organizations such as public citizen, common cause, credo mobile, free speech for people and the california league of conservation voters all advocated for passage of the resolution in the california legislature. public citizen circulated a petition signed by more than 50,000 from california, and it has successfully advocated for similar resolutions in states such as vermont and maryland.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/citizens-united-california_n_1652684.html

3616,i have had an eye infection now for about 3 weeks. it appears to be a small internal stye on my lower eyelid. my eye doc gave me amoxil by mouth and tobramycin drops. it immediately responded and was doing much better until about day 8. i went back to the eye doc and he gave me a z-pak to take orally and changed they eye drops to zymaxid. i am on day 3 of that now and am worried it isnt responding like it should. i still have some pain (which as lessened), but i have had a big bag of fluid under my eyelid. i have been using warm compresses as directed, but yesterday started a few cool ones to try to help reduce the edema in my eyelid.i am woried about mrsa or something more serious than a stye since the eyelid isnt responding to treatment.

3619,i hurt my foot jumping off a steeplechase barrier during cross country practice 5 days ago and forced myself to walk on it over the next few days until i got an xray and was told it was broken- a displaced fracture in the 5th metatarsal. i have been aqua jogging every day since and strength and conditioning exercising but i still feel its not working me hard enough. i am a runner and am terrified of my losing my fitness. is there anything i can do to make my pool workouts harder without swimming, and is there any other non weight bearing exercises i can do? also is there anything i should include in my diet which may help speed the recovery process as i'm not sure if i can cope with these crutches much longer, my other leg is starting to hurt now.
3620,i only have problems with my left eye. i constantly day in and day out have irritation and pull strings of yellow and white out. i have even pulled black stings over one inch out that have black calcified balls on them. it feels as if floaters of blurred goo pass over the eye and i cannot see most of the time. the mucus i pull out is very thick and murcky feeling and feels as if there is no end - i can literally feel it coming from behind the eye. there is constant pain behind my left eye, pain in the left nasal passage which becomes very stuffy, pain in the cheek bone and left ear. it feels like pink eye and i have all of the symptoms except for the actual pink. if you look at eye you can see yellow discoloration on the eyelid and under it looks like i have a constant black eye. i have tried to track everything from out door pollutants, to food or certians surroundings and nothing. i have seen so many doctors and i have not gotten help.
3621,my daughter is 3 1/2 yrs old and very intelligent. she is sweet as pie, interacts as well as any only child with other children and learns very quickly but there is a problem...her temper. it happens most frequently in the evenings but now more and more it is anytime of day everyday she throws fits. she will stomp around the house shouting i'm angry! she will throw things, hit and destroy anything in her path. she begins to breathe heavy and seem uncontrollable and unconsolable. i am raising her on my own and my biggest concern is that something is wrong with her. she wants told me when i asked why she was doing this that she is sick. her father is bi-polar and once diagnosed with some form of adhd or add. i worry all the time now when this happens if this is normal or if something really is wrong. once she calms down, usually between 5-30 minutes. she will apologize and ask if i am mad. so long as i say no, it will be over until the next one. is this a sign of trouble or normal behavior? am i overreacting or should i prepare for the worst?    please, any advise would be helpful.supermom 30

3631,my child has an autistic spectrum disorder and a hearing impairment when they returned home by taxi 2 and half weeks ago, they reported that 2 children at school had pulled them to the ground and that one of the children had forceibly hit their head onto the playground floor.    my son said that he told the teachers gave him an ice pack, we were not notified and he completed the day at school.    my son complained he had a headache and that he could not see properly anymore when he returned home from school. he had a bump on the back of his head. we took him to a and e who admitted him to hospital with a head and eye injury.    we have been advised that he has occlusions in his left eye, that he has double vision.    he is due to have his optic nerve tested to assess damage.    does anyone know of any good sources of information about head injury causing these types of damage to vision.    also is there anything we can do to improve his vision as he is now unable to read his comics/books, write,and play his nintendo/lego etcmy son has now has now been refered for an mri.     his head injury happened on 28 november 2007, how likely is it that anything will show up on a scan now?is it possible to have difficulity with what you see and it be related to just your brain not your eyes?also he is saying that his dinners dont taste the same anymore and he keeps starting to talk and then saying whats that word? or he says something and then comments i did not want to say that word.we have noticed that when he looks at objects with both eyes or his left eye then he is saying that red things are orange and that his spongebob toy has gone green.    however when he covers his left eye and looks just with his right eye then his colors are normal again. could these things be related to head injury?

3633,ok so im a 16 year old female. im currently on the pill. i take it religiously everyday. i have been on it for a while now and i have spotting in between periods so my doc has to keep bumping up the hormones to try to stop the bleeding. so anyway i was at a party and had (drunken sex) without protection. i had just met the guy and i dont know why i had sex with him. it was at approximatly 5 or 6 am on saterday. later on saterday night i started bleeding as if it was a period. it wasnt my first time having sex so i know it wasnt bc he popped my cherry.    but i asked him were he came and he told me he came inside me. so im freaking out because i just learned bout implantation bleeding and im not sure if it can happen as early as hours or if it takes days or weeks. im really scared, please help!!!
3634,o.k. i posted a couple of weeks ago. i have been talking to my high school sweetheart. it is complicated because i am getting a divorce, and he is not sure. we had not done anything physical. it was more texting and talking about what the possibilities are. on monday, i went to lunch with him. after i did not hear from him all weekend, i decided that i did not want to pursue the relationship any farther and told him that i was ready for a physical relationship and he is not, so we should just be friends. i then told him that we can't talk for a while because i need to get myself together and lose the feelings and he needs to figure out what he wants in life. he asked me if the physical part of the relationship was that important to me, and out of honesty, i said yes. about an hour and a half into the conversation, he leaned in a kissed me. really kissed me. then he did it again. i could tell he was immediately freaking out. we said out goodbyes and he asked me to be understanding of his time to proccess. it was a huge deal. about ten minutes later, i got a text that said how can something feel so wrong and so right at the same time. then, he asked if i thought he has betrayed his children. we talked a bit and he told me he needed a couple of days to clear his head. not necciserily proccess, but just clear his head. the past few weeks have been intense. i obliged and suggested i do the same. i have not contacted him and been giving him his space. my question is this: when a man is clearing his head, are they really just not thinking about anything or are they making decisions or what? i am not all torn up or anything. i am just wanting to know what is going through his head.
3635,i have a 13 year old niece whose father was killed a month before she was born.    ironically, she was born on father  s day.     her mother (my younger sister) compensated by giving my niece extra attention and never leaving her side unless absolutely necessary, i.e. to go to work/school.    as the years have gone by, my niece has been exhibiting anxieties.    she cannot be left alone, at all.    she has anxiety attacks if my sister walks out to take the trash and she can  t see her through a window.    she once called the police because my sister took a few extra minutes returning from dumping the trash, which was heavier than usually and made walking to the garbage dumpster a little more difficult.    if my niece hears a little noise from outside, upstairs or the hallway, she immediately panics.    sometimes, she may just be imaging she heard something and forces herself into an anxiety attack.    she is scared to walk to the school bus stop alone, although it is right in her same apartment complex (she does not have to go out to the main street).    she cannot stay home alone after school unless she has someone (mom, step-dad or me) on the phone with her at all times, until someone gets home.    she must keep all windows and blinds closed for fear that someone will see her home alone and try to come and harm or kidnap her.    we are pretty sure that my niece is afraid that she will lose her mother or be taken away from her mother but we don  t know how we can help her deal with her anxiety.    we were hoping to unite her with some of her father  s family in hopes that it will help fill a void she may have and also help her to learn more about her father and who he was and where she comes from?    she seems to also have a fear of defecating.    not sure of all the details in that respect but i do know that she will hold it for a week or more, until she can  t hold it in anymore.    my sister has taken her to therapy but nothing came of it and my sister cannot afford to continue to send her to therapy.    so, what can we do to help my niece with her anxieties, phobias and void?

3637,hello, i am currently have 2 pairs of glasses one is for distance -4od & -5 os and a computer pair -2 od & -2.5 os.    i just went and saw my opthalmologist because i felt my vision was a bit worse than before, he checked it and said there was no needed change in my distance rx, but i explained that with my computer pair, i see more clearly out of the right eye if i tilt the glasses forward to an angle, so he said that means i need a weaker lens, so he bumped up my computer rx to -2.5od and -3os, does this sound right, also how does it happen that my computer rx would change, but my distance rx would be the same?    thanks for your help!

3639,hi, i just have a question for anyone who might have the same thing that i have been going through for the past 2 years. starting in 2005 i have had a root canal on tooth #3 and a rootcanal on tooth #2..i aiso had re rootcanal treatment done on tooth #3 twice and twice i have had surgery on the root ..now tooth #3 and tooth #2 are filed down very low and they have    put a crown together on them...i am still in pain, i am sensitive to hot (not cold) and by the dentist touching the gum area..(everything looks fine on the xrays they say) i have been to 3 different dentists since all of this has started..and no one can figure out why i am still having pain?...i was at the dentist again last week..and he doesn't even know what to do? he did say maybe i could have the tooth removed(#3) but can't give me a straight answer if this will stop the pain? i could try and have some kind of gum surgery that might take a long time to heal and it still won't make the pain go away and my insurance will not cover it, because my gums are healthy? it would cost me somewhere between 650.00 or more?? i am at a lost as to should i just have the tooth removed..but i am also scared that if they do that it will not make the pain go away, and because i had all this work done already with the root being removed, i will probably have a hard time getting an implant in place?? sorry so long..just wonderign if anyone else has ever expierenced this before? or does anyone have any good suggestions..i am desperate for this pain to go away. thanks.
3640,my son is a very bright student and happy young man.    two and a half years ago we had a daughter, up until that point he was an only child.    over the past year, he has been having    very dramatic, scary    fits.    crying, screaming, recently hitting over various things.    i can't rememeber what set off the very first one, but i do remember the second one was last summer when i was returning home from my families house far away.    he wanted to stay, which at one time was the plan, but due to some misbehaving on his part and because my sister is not to much into observing her own children closely, we changed our minds.    when it was time to leave, he started crying and throwing a fit.    once on the road home, he spent two hours yelling, screaming, crying and kicking the back of my chair.    all this with his baby sister in the back seat.    he threatened to jump out of the car, but never did. his dad tried talking to him, but he could not calm him down.    finally, i got his nana on the phone and she calmed him down.    the rest of the drive home went well.    it was like some switch went off and he was back to himself.several months went by without any outburst, but then here it came again.    i had bought him a book he had wanted when i went to the bookstore and got his sister a book too.    when he got home and saw his sister had a book, he began to ask questions.    i told him i got him a book as well, but i would let him have it as soon as he finished the one he was reading.    the next night he finished his book and wanted to get his new one.    when he received it, a look of disappointment came across his face.    he put the book down and started to pout.    what was that, i said, with my hand to my ear like i was waiting for a thank you.    instead he just pouted.    i told him i would take the book back, just to give it to me.    he handed me the book and asked if he could pick the new one.    i told him that he would not be getting a new book, that he was acting ungrateful and he should be happy with what he got.    from there the fit took off, screaming and yelling he demanded his book back, it wasn't fair his sister got to pick her book.    when my husband tried to get him to go to his room, he wouldn't move.    the whole thing turned into a big mess.    he ended up hitting and biting my husband.    yelling and crying demanding his book back.    we called his nana over, which he typically would not act like that in front of her, but didn't seem to care.    the rest of the fit involved him running down the street, threatening to jump out his windows...when it was over, it was over.    like nothing ever happened.bewteen then and now, there have been a few fits, but my husband has gotten pretty good about talking him down.last night however, it was on again.    we have been talking for months about moving him to the downstairs bedroom so that his sister could be close to us. up until this time, she has been in our bedroom.    at first he would not hear anything about moving, but finally he acted as if he did not mind.    last week i mentioned picking a paint color, and when we went to the hardware store, he was the one who brought up picking a color.    this past weeked i painted the downstairs room and moved his things into the room. all sunday long he talked about how he loved it, read his books in there, showed it off to everyone who came by to see it, but then it was bedtime.    i had no sooner tucked him in and here he came.    he wanted his new room back, he was not staying there, he was use to where he was and did not want to move.    the fit was on...crying, screaming, arms flailing, stratching himself, stiffing up, screaming and screaming.    after a spanking, that did no good, it only made him madder, and lots of talking to, he finally settled down and went to sleep.     but sometime during the night, he was at my bedside crying about how he wanted his room back.    my husband ended up sleeping in the living room downstairs and my son spent the rest of the night in his new room.    of coarse this morning the first words out of his mouth were, i want my room back.    one other note, his teachers have always loved him.    they always talk about what a wonderful student he is and how helpful and sweet his is.    he has never thrown a fit of any sort that i know of in school.    however, on friday this past week,    i was sitting with my son and daughter reading books and talking.    all of a sudden, i notice a bite make on his forearm.    i asked him who bit him and he said no one.    i told him it was clearly a bite mark and i wanted to know who bit him.    he stated he couldn't remember over and over.    i finally told him that he had to remember who bit him, and he finally said he did it himself.    he stated that he had to retake a math test, that he thought he had failed the first one.    i asked if anyone saw him do it.    at first, he said no one saw him and then he finally admitted that not only did his teacher see it, but she had to take him out the room and ask him to calm down and explained that he did not fail the test, theywe just having a few students do it again.    when husband and i tried to talk to him about the situation, he kept saying we were making him angry by bringing it up.    my husband and i do not know how to handle this.    does he need help?    i think he needs to be punished, grounded for his behaviors and that we should never in any kind of way give in.    my husband thinks we need to talk to him and not punish.    thanks in advance for any advise you may have.

3644,my grandson has had behavioral problems in school and at home since approximately age 3.     he ran away from preschool at age 3. he is now 8 years old and his public school is at their wits end with him and it's only the first week of school.    some things that are noteworthy:    his iq is 197. he has bitten his left hand in the soft fleshy part below his thumb and index finger since age 2 and has a large (size of a 50 cent piece) scar there.    as a small boy he would shudder while biting his hand.    he continues to bit his hand occasionally but not to the point of creating an open wound as in the past and the shuddering has stopped. he claims he must do it to feel better and it doesn't hurt because there is no feeling there, presumably because it is all scar tissue now.    this middle child can be a good boy in one-on-one situations; however, when with his 3 year old little sister and his 10 year old sister he is usually starting fights.    he attacks his older sister on the school bus -- hitting, kicking and name calling.    she is embarrassed to be his sister in school. he was sent to the principle's office the first week of school for threatening a classmate that if she didn't shut up he was going to jam a pencil down her throat.    his school work is sloppy and he hates school.    i contend he is not being challenged sufficiently and should be in a gifted school program, probably at a private school.    additionally, the parents are working with a doctor on neurological issues they hope will stop the hand biting.    he's been to many counselors and none do any good. . . he disrespects them all and they give up.    he tells his older sister, i like to see how far i can push adults.    any suggestions, please.this discussion is related towhat is a normal iq in children.

3647,just received this in my e-mail, wanted to share.bananas to you friend,a professor at ccny for a physiological psych class told his class about bananas.. he said the expression 'going bananas' is from the effects of bananas on the brain. read on:after reading this, you'll never look at a banana in the same way again.bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and glucose combined with fiber. a banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost of energy.research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout. no wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's leading athletes.but energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit. it can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.depression:according to a recent survey undertaken by mind amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. this is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.pms:forget the pills - eat a banana. the vitamin b6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.anemia:high in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.blood pressure:this unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. so much so, the us food and drug administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.brain power:200 students at a twickenham (middlesex) school were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.constipation:high in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.hangovers:one of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. the banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.heartburn:bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.morning sickness:snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.mosquito bites:before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.nerves:bananas are high in b vitamins that help calm the nervous system.overweightand at work? studies at the institute of psychology in austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and crisps. looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. the report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.ulcers:the banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. it is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. it also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.temperature control:many other cultures see bananas as a 'cooling' fruit that can lower both the physical and em otional temperature of expectant mothers. in thailand , for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature.seasonal affective disorder (sad): bananas can help sad sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.smoking &tobacco use:bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. the b6, b12 they contain, as well as the potassium and magnesium found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.stress:potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. when we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. these can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack.strokes:according to research in the new england journal of medicine, eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!warts:those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart, with the yellow side out. carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape!so, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. when you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin a and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals. it is also rich in potassium and is one of the best val ue foods around so maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so that we say, 'a banana a day keeps the doctor away!'pass it on to your friendsps: bananas must be the reason monkeys are so happy all the time! i will add one here; want a quick shine on our shoes?? take the inside of the banana skin, and rub directly on the shoe...polish with dry cloth. amazing fruit !

3653,my partner and i just started having intercourse without a condom, now every time he masturbates he smells me. it's not a strong or nasty smell, however he's concerned.    he has never not used a condom in any other relationships.    he has no other side effects like itching, rash or soreness.    could it be in his mind? memory smell association?    i have no discharge or yeast infections and we shower after intercourse.
3654,hello,i have a question regarding this sharp, sometimes throbbing soreness above my right eye, right on the eyebrow, sort of left center.    it seems to ease off at night and when i wake up, but after 2.5 to 3 hours of being awake it starts to hurt.    i can feel it coming on slowly then all of a sudden this pain starts strong.    i would rate it as an 8 on a pain scale.    light does not aggravate it more than any normal time and tylenol only seems to dull the pain.    please help if you have any theories as to what this may be.    it has been on-going for the last 6 days now.
3655,i have a beautiful little two year old. i'm a first time parent along with my husband, and in some areas we've gone all wrong. my 2 year still sleeps with us, still has a pacifier and will not go to sleep without a trusted family member by her side. she has a habit of holding someone's hand while she goes to sleep.i want her to sleep in her own and bed and also to be able to fall asleep on    her own.i'm frustrated that she wakes up when no one is next to her and that she's too big to be in our bed now.how do i start all over with out losing my sanity???
3656,my son is 5yrs of age.    he is extremely funny and smart. however, in the last few months he    is using words such as i hate you, fat face, fat bum - he says to his brother - i'll punch you in the face (he never has though) and like other people's questions i have read he also does not seem to care about things such as time out, a small smack on the bum or taking away of toys...he laughs when i am telling him off.    he does sit in his time out calmly but the minute he comes out he sometimes starts his attitude right back up.    i don;t have a certain reason he could be acting like this - could it just be the summer months and not having a proper schedule - no moving house, no new baby...he acts like a tough guy but he is very sensitive - he gets upset easily if he thinks anyone is making fun of him or if he falls down and hurts himself he looses it (though he is getting a bit better with the latter).    he is good at school - he has friends and his teachers love him to bits. anyway, enough talking for now - i just wanted to see what you thought.    is this something that just passes and then if so what is the best way to punish if continues for a while...thank you.
3657,okay i have had this eye problem that is in both eyes my right and left but are in different locations its whenever i blink or move my eyes fast i see a small darkish colored spot in my right eye just to the left of the center of my vision and this spot only appears if i'm near close up objects and blink but as i get farther away from an object the spot fades away and is barely noticeable it also seems to appear when i enter dim lighted rooms when coming from a bright room and it seems to appear as a redish color. and i've been to 2 ophthalmologists and they both can't explain what it is and said its normal i'm only 18 years old and have no family history of any eye disease no cataracts no macular degeneration etc..(this is not an eye floater because this spot is stationary)any idea what this could be thanks.

3662,hi ladies.    i just finished my first month of clomid (i have pcos and rarely ovulate on my own) and have been researching some natural fertility treatments to use alongside the clomid.    i'm really trying to regulate my diet (low gluten, lots of fruits and veg, tofu, full fat dairy...), exercise, and am even considering acupuncture.    i don't normally practice eastern medicine techniques, but i figure i'll try anything right now and i've found a lot of promising things regarding traditional chinese medicine techniques and fertility.    my husband thinks i'm crazy for even trying this, but i really feel like i have nothing to lose.    are any of you incorporating any natural techniques?    i'm curious as to what anyone else might be trying and if you're seeing any results.thanks!

3664,i have had sex on the last day of my period with my ex which was sept 6 (unprotected) but what confused me was i had another period at then end of sept but i dont remember exact dates. i then had sex again with my new boyfriend october 14 he used a condom at the beginning but without me knowing he took it off at the end but he didnt ejaculate inside me. i also didnt have no periods at all in october.i usually only have periods at the beginning of the month so im very confused. i am 10 weeks pregnant who would be the father of my baby?
3665,i don't know. to me it seems like a thing that's really special, and only happens a few times in 2 months. but people complain how they've gone sooo long without sex and it has been only a month. it just doesn't seem that long. how often are you supposedly to have it?
3666,i had a root canal done by an endodontist about a week ago. currently have a temporary till i see my dentist for the permanent crown in 20 days. after the appointment it felt so much better :). no more pain. however, the gum line is quiteitchy and irritated.     is that normal or do i need to go back in? are they supposed to fill the cracks on the outside of the tooth too or just the hole they made?    thank you for taking the time to read this.sicerely, deanna
3667,i have a 9 year old granddaughter that has temper tantrums.    i love her so much and don't know what to do.    she disrupts the whole house including my house as we live next door to them.    she can be so sweet and loving then go into a rage if you disagree with her or try to correct her.    she is very smart and she and i are very close, but she will try to rage at me and most of the time i can nip it, and then she feels really bad.    example: last night she and her brother who is almost 4 started fighting so i hollered out the window to stop and she said to me stay at your own house. i immediately went out and told her she was not going to speak to me like that, this has happened once before with about the same senario.    then all hell breaks loose.    she has been going to a counselor for about 6 weeks.    they say even though she is 9 her anger management development is that of a 2 year old.    i don't believe that, she knows what she is doing.    i don't believe the parents are being consistant enough and really let's her get away with too much.    they do a lot of threatening and hollering and will say if you don't stop you will not be able to do this or that, but they do not follow through.    i don't usually have many problems with her because i don't let her get away with these actions when she is with me.    she is very rude and nasty to her mother from the second she walks through the door.    when she goes into these rages she will scream at her mother and father at the top of her lungs. i know it has been hell in their house and they are very discouraged. i am so afraid of what is coming if this continues to happen.    i'm afraid the 4 year old will start having these issues too. now he is the sweetest, most laid back and funniest kid and fun to be around.    it is really hard, because we try to stay out of it, but it really does effect us, because we have as much care of the kids as their mom and dad do, they both work we help out.    help

3672,atlanta (cnn) -- a north georgia chapter of the ku klux klan has applied to adopt a stretch of highway in union county, georgia, according to paperwork obtained by cnn on monday.the application, which would allow the white supremacy group to receive state recognition for cleaning up a one-mile portion of a highway, was filed by the international keystone knights of the kkk on may 21.if the georgia department of transportation accepts the application, the kkk would be responsible for cleaning litter on a part of georgia state route 515 in the appalachian mountains near the north carolina border.all we want to do is adopt a highway, said april chambers, the chapter's secretary. we're not doing it for publicity. we're doing it to keep the mountains beautiful. people throwing trash out on the side of the road ... that ain't right.jill goldberg, a georgia dot spokeswoman, confirmed the application but said, the department is deferring comment beyond that, however, until a resolution is determined.dot officials will discuss the matter monday with representatives from the state attorney general's office, she said.chambers told cnn she didn't know anything about that meeting but said the group is supposed to meet with the dot at some point. state rep. tyrone brooks, d-atlanta, has been working against the group's adoption application, she said.we're not racists, chambers said monday. we just want to be with white people. if that's a crime, then i don't know. it's all right to be black and latino and proud, but you can't be white and proud. i don't understand it.a similar request in missouri set off a legal battle that stretched for years and went all the way to the u.s. supreme court. a ku klux klan chapter sought to adopt a portion of interstate 55. a federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the kkk from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand.however, the missouri department of transportation eventually kicked the kkk out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman bob brendel said monday. the state also named the stretch of i-55 after civil rights activist rosa parks, according to the st. louis post-dispatch.georgia has been participating in the adopt-a-highway program for more than 20 years. the program provides advertising for sponsors who agree to clean a stretch of road on a sign posted along the stretch.any civic-minded organization, business, individual, family, city, county, state, or federal agency is welcome to volunteer in the georgia adopt-a-highway program, the dot website says.there is no charge to sponsors, goldberg said. we provide the safety vest and materials to collect the trash. we provide what's needed to do the program ... their contribution is the labor.chambers said the group is more than 100 strong. we have a lot of support, she said.i don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway), she said. would it be any different if it was the black panthers or something? someone always has some kind of race card.on its website, the international keystone knights of the kkk says it is fed up with the federal tyranny and oppression of reconstruction, and the time was ripe for clandestine armed resistance.the southern poverty law center, which monitors hate groups, lists the kkk as the most infamous -- and oldest -- of american hate groups.over the years since it was formed in december 1865, the klan has typically seen itself as a christian organization, although in modern times klan groups are motivated by a variety of theological and political ideologies, the law center's website says.we're not a hate group, chambers insisted monday. we don't hate anybody. we're just white people that want to stick with white people. the naacp (national association for the advancement of colored people) wants to stick with black people. just because i'm white, i can't stick with my own group?http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/11/us/georgia-kkk-highway/index.html?hpt=hp_t2

3678,http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10290590-romney-defends-poor-people-remarkon his campaign's flight to minnesota this morning, mitt romney vigorously defended his economic message and engaged in a bit of damage control when asked by a reporter to explain his comment on cnn that he is not concerned about the very poor.no no no no. no no. you've got to take the whole sentence, all right, as opposed to saying, and then change it just a little bit, because then it sounds very different. i've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is gonna be devoted to helping middle income people, all right? we have a safety net for the poor in, and if there are holes in it, i will work to repair that. and if there are people that are falling through the cracks i want to fix that, romney said. wealthy people are doing fine. but my focus in the campaign is on middle income people. of course i'm concerned about all americans -- poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle income families who i think have been most hurt by the obama economy.advertisementon cnn this morning, romney gave a shorter version of that response, upon which both republican and democrats quickly seized, looking to paint the republican frontrunner as uncaring and out of touch. (rick tyler, a spokesman for a pro-gingrich super pac tweeted about the quote.)  i  m not concerned about the very poor. we have a safety net there. if it needs repair, i  ll fix it, romney told cnn's soledad o'brien. i  m not concerned about the very rich, they  re doing just fine. i  m concerned about the very heart of the america, the 90 percent, 95 percent of americans who right now are struggling.  the line, problematic in soundbite form, is by no means new to romney's stump speech or interview talking points. romney frequently discusses the need to help the middle class rebound from the effects of the recession as a primary motivating factor for his campaign.romney's also spoken in the past about his concern for the impoverished.i'm concerned about the poor in this country. we have to make sure the safety net is strong and able to help those who can't help themselves, romney said in south carolina. i'm not terribly worried about the very wealthiest in our society, they're doing just fine. i'm concerned about the vast middle class of our nation, the 90 percent of americans, the 95 percent of americans who are having tough times.on the plane this morning, romney also conceded that he did see holes in the safety net that would need fixing.oh i'm sure there are. i'm sure there are places where people fall between the cracks. and finding those places is one of the things that is the responsibility of government. we do have a very ample safety net in america, with medicaid, housing vouchers, food stamps, earned income tax credit. we have a number of ways of helping the poor, romney said. and yet my focus and the area that i think is the greatest challenge that the country faces right now is not, is not to focus our effort on how we help the poor as much as to focus our effort on how to help the middle class in america, and get more people in the middle class and get people out of being poor and becoming middle income.
3679,i need some help. what do you call it when a woman no more has any feelings, or yearning; if that 's what you want to call it. i love him very much, but feel cold, and disinterested when he wants me to do anything with him . i do whatever with him just to please him, but feel it is a chore. he now has threatened to go out, and get it somewhere else. if he does that, i would be scared to touch him for fear if getting a disease. what do i do?
3680,here we are back to sunday and i've been pretty scarce on the forum this week and i'm sorry for that.    just seems that life takes over once in a while............anyway, i'm sitting at 147, which is up 3 pounds.    my eating has not changed, but i have not been exercising the way i should be because of the way i've been feeling.    with my sluggish thyroid, i can tell that exercise is crucial to even being able to maintain my weight, let alone lose.i hope to get in a good work out, or at least a relatively long walk today, but first i've got to get house work done and get ready for the coming work week.will be interested in seeing how everyone else it doing.
3681,help!    the past few nights i have had little sleep due to the pain and discomfort of my teeth.    i am only in pain at night when i'm laying in bed.    i finally had enough, and went to the dentist this afternoon.     i am grinding my teeth and that is what is causing all this discomfort.does anyone have any suggestions on what kind of night guard i should buy?    my dentist recommended to buy one at cvs/walgreens.    i guess, custom made ones from the dentist are not covered my insurance and can be pricey!i was also told that alieve would help with the pain and discomfort.     anyone please suggestions, i greatly appreciate any help.    i need to sleep tonight!
3682,my my son is 5yrs old he is really out of control it got that bad he was thrown out of school until he gets medical help. what happened was my son went to school and he nipped a wee girl so his teacher took him to the side and asked him why he did it he said i dont know so when they got to the class the another teacher told him to sit in an empty room but my son said no he didnt want to so he tried to run out but the teacher tried to stop him so he slapped her on her arm then another teacher told him go stand in the cloakroom but he refused he ran into another class with other pupil and started destroying the room the pupils in the class were then moved to a different room so no one got hurt four teachers surrounded my son to calm him down but all four got injured. after all this happened my son calmed down he cleaned up all the mess he made in the class and then taken to the office me and his dad were called to go to the school where they said to us not to bring him back until he has some medical help .in the school my son has a bahaviour form which he has to get happy faces each day and they also get which is called golden time which means 30 mins before the end of class they get to play with toys well he was told he wasnt aloud any golden time and he was getting a sad face on his behaviour form which obviously my son didnt not like it.could the school be causing my sons bad behaviour or could it be that me and his real dad have been broke up since he was a baby and every sunday his dad gets him for 8 hours but when he goes with his dad there is no discipline and he is aloud to do what he wants when he wants his dad also calls me names and when my son comes back he tells me what his dad has said i just tell him not to listen. but his dad is trying to take me back through the court for more contact which i dont think he should be getting as my sons behaviour is getting worse and i need to try and get things sorted with him before i start changing my sons routine my son is also urinating all over his room i have had to lift carpets because of him we tell him he cant do that it bad and dirty and hes a big boy now so he needs to pee in the toilet but he doesnt seem to listen and he is also hitting his sister and biting her i cant even leave him alone with her because i have came into his room to see him sitting on top of her punching her what makes this situation worse is im pregnant and im due in 5 weeks and im scared he will hurt this baby im soo stressed out at the moment i really need help could anyone give me advice on what the problem could be or how to fix it i cant live like this anymore

3686,i noticed that some people complained about halos and not being able to see well peripherally when they drive (after having lenses inserted) at night & use their computer.    one even suggested lowering ambient light.    some of the lenses are only 5mm max diameter (crystalens, at least).    i have 'big pupils -- they're 5 mm in roomlight.    in dark situations they're 8 mm, so i would have a ring around the implanted lens that has no correction at all.    i haven't had cataract surgery yet.    am trying to convince baush & lomb to make the crystalens in 8 mm.    they don't seem to be interested.    they don't seem to have realized that some people have big pupils in room light and it would expend in the dark.    one of their scientists told me that the crystalens 'might not be able to make an adjustment to serve an 8 mm opening.    i think that was off the top of his head.    he also told me that if the lens has been in for a year or two, the cilia muscles may have grown around it to the extent that it couldn't be removed.this discussion is related toafter eye surgery-rezoom lenses.

3695,i have a 4 year-old son who has just started pre-k this year and he is having a hard time coping with his new environment. up until now, he has never been in any type of structured environment. from the time he was born, he was babsitted by grandmammas on both sides of the family where there was no structure. i must admitt because of this, he is spoiled and very stubborn. everyday he goes to school and i get a bad report from his pre-k teacher that he is hitting, talking back to her, will not do what he is asked to do, and so on. he has poor cognative skills that needs some work and we are looking into getting him so therapy for that. but my question is, is he showing any signs of ad or some sort of mental behavior? he has a nine-year old brother who has adhd and has been taking meds since he was six years old.

3697,i got my first hepb vaccine shot 3.5 months ago.    as far as i know, to be fully protected, i need the whole series, which ideally consists of shots at 0 months (start), 1 month, and 6 months.    i read on the cdc website that if you didn't complete the series, you can resume anytime without restarting from the first shot.my question is, what will the timing be now if i resume the series?    if i get my second shot now (3.5 months after the first one), will my third one still be 5 months from now?    this is important to me as i'm living in a household with a hepb-infected person and i know i'm at increased risk.thanks very much!

(which made me feel like ****) but it was a reaction from me. he acts like its really no big deal and i don't know how to make him understand that it is a big deal.and yes i found out that he touched my daughter and i went crazy. this is very hard for me. i have talked to my mom about this i told her that i wanted him out of my house. but it is very hard because he is my son. i am not sure as to what to do about all of this. he told me that he thought that he was bi-sexual. i don't care about that i just want him to stop doing what he is doing. i don't understand why he is doing this. i have tried not to leave him alone with younger children but it seems to still happen. he is really not a bad kid except for this. i love him dearly and its killing me inside. there is no one that i can turn to about all of this.    i have researched on the net and i am going to talk to his dr.(therapist) first thing monday morning. but if there is any advice from anyone please give it.

3705,last year was one for the history books, as a long-term warming trend brought two record highs for each record low between 2000 and 2010. and even more concerning, in the past year there were five record highs for each low recorded. nbc's anne thompson reports.if you found yourself bundling up in scarves, hats, and long underwear less than usual last year, you weren't alone: 2012 was the warmest year on record in the contiguous united states, according to scientists with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.the average temperature for 2012 was 55.3 degrees fahrenheit, 3.2 degrees above normal and a full degree higher than the previous warmest year recorded -- 1998 -- noaa said in its report tuesday. all 48 states in the contiguous u.s. had above-average annual temperatures last year, including 19 that broke annual records, from connecticut through utah.  we  re taking quite a large step,   said jake crouch, a climate scientist from the noaa national climatic data center, which has recorded temperatures in the contiguous u.s. for the past 118 years.advertise | adchoicesit was also a historic year for extreme weather, scientists with the federal agency said. with 11 disasters that surpassed $1 billion in losses, including superstorm sandy, hurricane isaac, and tornadoes across the great plains, texas, and the southeast and ohio valley, noaa said 2012 was second only to 1998 in the agency's extreme weather index.a long-term warming trend for the u.s., combined with drought and a northerly jet stream, led to the record heat, explained crouch.during the winter season, the jet stream tended to stay further north of the u.s.-canadian border, so that limited colder outbreaks in the country. it also limited precipitation. so that led to a warm and dry winter season, and that persisted through the spring, he said.matt rourke / ap filepeople play in water from an open fire hydrant during the afternoon heat on july 18, 2012, in philadelphia. july was the hottest month ever on record in the contiguous u.s.that warm and dry spring and winter laid the groundwork for the drought we had this summer... . when we have drought, it tends to drive daytime temperatures upward.the unprecedented warm weather wasn't contained to the united states.a corresponding rise in global temperatures prompted the world meteorological organization to call the rate at which the arctic sea ice was melting alarming in its nov. 28, 2012, report.  the extent of arctic sea ice reached a new record low. the alarming rate of its melt this year highlighted the far-reaching changes taking place on earth  s oceans and biosphere. climate change is taking place before our eyes and will continue to do so as a result of the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have risen constantly and again reached new records,   world meteorological organization secretary-general michel jarraud said.each year since 2001 has been among the warmest on record worldwide, with 2012 likely to be no exception despite the cooling influence of la ni a early in the year, the report added.'horrible' sea level rise of more than 3 feet plausible by 2100, experts saywatch nbc's special coverage of the 2012 drought'wake-up call': chicago set to break 73-year-old snowless recordnoaa expects to have global data for 2012 sometime in the coming weeks, but crouch said scientists already know with certainty it's going to be in the top ten warmest years ever.adding to the extremes: 2012 was the driest year on record for the u.s., with 26.57 inches of average precipitation -- 2.57 inches below average. those dry conditions created an ideal environment for wildfires in the west, which charred 9.2 million acres -- the third highest amount ever recorded, noaa said tuesday.other notable climate activity from 2012:snowpack totals across the central and southern rockies were less than half normal.july was the hottest month ever on record in the contiguous u.s.tornado activity was concentrated toward the beginning of the season, with large outbreaks in march and april in the ohio valley and central plains, but the final 2012 tornado count will likely be less than 1,000 -- the least since 2002. the factors behind that are kind of related to what was going on with the drought. we didn't have these large storm systems moving through the country, so that limited precipitation, and that also limited severe weather outbreaks, crouch said. what made this year so high on the extreme weather index were cyclones, hurricanes, and the heat, he said.alaska was cooler and slightly wetter than average, and had a record-cold january. their january temperatures were 14 degrees below average. many locations in alaska had temperatures 30 degrees below zero, crouch said, adding that anchorage, alaska, set a new snow record.hawaii experienced growing drought conditions, with 47.4 percent of the state experiencing moderate-to-exceptional drought at the beginning of 2012 and 63.3 percent at the end of the year. alaska and hawaii were not included in the bulk of noaa's 2012 report because of terrain issues, and because scientists don't have records dating back as far as states in the contiguous u.s.while noaa made no meteorological forecasts for 2013, crouch said the drought was going to continue to be an issue.the drought got a lot of attention this summer when it was having impacts on agriculture. more than 60 percent of the country is still in drought, he said. and if things don't change, the drought is going to continue to be a big story in 2013.http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/08/16413805-noaa-2012-was-warmest-year-ever-for-us-second-most-extreme

3708,(reuters) - after taking a beating at the ballot box in 2010 and losing the messaging war on healthcare reform to well-financed opponents, democrats don't plan to take the high ground on campaign finance and super pacs going into november's election.traditionally, the party favors fundraising limits and disclosure of donors. but since a 2010 supreme court decision that allowed independent groups raise and spend unlimited funds to help campaigns, wealthy republicans started donating to dozens of such super political action committees and plan to help their party outspend democrats in what is expected to be the most expensive campaign in u.s. history.that, according to democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz, has forced her party to adapt to a campaign finance system that she says allows wealthy anonymous donors to try to buy elections with unlimited donations.we could set an example and lose, wasserman schultz told the reuters washington summit on wednesday. but, she added: i'm not going to stand on principle only to get run over by a truck.democrat bill burton helped create the priorities usa action super pac, which also has a non-profit advocacy arm, in 2011 to support president barack obama's re-election effort.burton said the group had raised $40 million so far and plans to spend $100 million in this election cycle.that pales, though, next to entities like the conservative crossroads groups founded by former george w. bush adviser karl rove. crossroads, which are a super pac and a related non-profit, has pledged to spend up to $300 million on 2012 races, two-thirds of it on defeating obama.efforts on both sides of the aisle are expected to top $1 billion in campaign spending this year.democrats at the reuters summit said that through traditional channels, groups such as the democratic congressional campaign committee are out-raising their republican counterparts.but that will be far from counterbalancing the super pacs and their wealthy backers, a lesson already ruefully learned.having watched what happened in the 2010 election ... we were concerned about what the outside republican money could mean in this election, said burton.the fuzzy lines surrounding political donations surfaced on wednesday when the new york attorney general said he is investigating contributions to the u.s. chamber of commerce, a tax-exempt group.the chamber, is not required to disclose its donors, has been active in recent elections backing mostly republican candidates.one of the outside groups whose spending and fundraising largely remain a mystery is the chamber of commerce, which backs business-friendly candidates and policies and commonly falls on the republican side.on wednesday, in the latest salvo against secret donors, a source confirmed to reuters that the new york attorney general was investigating a charity connected to the chamber for illegal donations.'not the rules we wish we had'the role of super pacs was seen in the bitterly contested republican primary battle this spring.candidates like former u.s. senator rick santorum and former house speaker newt gingrich were able to keep their campaigns going, and keep ads on the air, much longer with help from deep-pocketed political sugar daddies: businessman foster friess and casino mogul sheldon adelson, respectively.burton said democrats, having surveyed the landscape, are warming to the fight.they are getting engaged at a much brisker pace than they were previously because if they don't, there will never be reform, said burton. we go into this campaign season with the rules we have, not the rules we wish we had.guy cecil, who runs the democratic senatorial campaign committee, said his party was not going to unilaterally disarm and allow the other side to buy the election.while praising the quality of campaigns many democrats are running, i don't think that that message alone is strong enough to overcome $1 billion in spending.source: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-washington-summit-money-idusbre85q1sr20120627

3719,as hundreds of thousands of people braved sub-freezing temperatures in washington, d.c., on friday to join the anti-abortion protest march for life, house speaker john boehner (r-ohio) took the opportunity to reiterate his commitment to banning abortion in america for good.addressing the crowd at the national mall via video broadcast, boehner said it's time for anti-abortion activisits to commit ourselves to doing everything we can to protect the sanctity of life. step one, he said, is making permanent the hyde amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being used to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest.for the new congress, that means bringing together a bipartisan pro-life majority and getting to work, boehner said. in accordance with the will of the people, we will again work to pass the no taxpayer funding for abortion act, formally codifying the hyde amendment.boehner said he will make it a national priority to help make abortion a relic of the past.let that be one of our most fundamental goals this year, he said.the march for life attracted a diverse crowd of young and old protesters from across the country. hundreds of parents had bundled up their infants and toddlers and strapped protest signs to their strollers. michael kennedy, 33, and his wife bethany, who is pregnant, drove their four children down from westerly, rhode island to stand in 20-degree weather on the mall.they're troopers, bethany told huffpost. we felt like we have a responsibility just to be a witness to everyone else, to see that this is life, our children. we needed to be here.several lawmakers made it out to the protest to address the crowd in person. rep. diane black (r-tenn.) touted a bill she recently introduced that would strip title x family planning funds from planned parenthood, and sen. rand paul (r-ky.) delivered a sermon that called for a spiritual cleansing.our nation is adrift, adrift in a wilderness where right and wrong have become subservient to a hedonism of the moment, paul said. i believe our country is in need of a spiritual cleansing.he added, we much preach a gospel so full of compassion, a gospel so full of justice that it cannot be resisted. then and only then will the law again protect the innocent.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/25/john-boehner-abortion-march-for-life_n_2552597.html?ref=topbar
3720,my 3 year old daughter has been toilet trained for over a year and has only every had a few accidents.    she took to the toilet really well and was trained within a few days. suddenly yesterday she begun to wee on the floor. she went in the bathroom and did it on the floor. she tried to clean it up by emptying a whole bottle of handwash and covering it with a towel. i ignored this just telling her that she shouldnt have used all that hand soap and should have told mummy.she then continued to do it 3 times yesterday evening, once in the bathroom and once even walking right past the bathroom to go and do it in the playroom.    i feel this is definately not due to problems with potty training or because she is not making it to the toilet on time as she is very good at holding it and have been for nearly a year and a half.we do have another baby on the way, and although we have tried very hard to be positive, i guess she could be anxious about it.    when i try to talk to her about it she says she is happy about baby coming and excited, but she is only 3.fyi she is a good girl and says sorry as soon as i see the pee.    she is very sensitive to people's feelings and doesn't normally do much attention seeking.please help!

3727,the supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in fisher v. university of texas, the court  s first case on the use of race in higher education admissions since its decision in gratz v. bollinger and grutter v. bollinger.gail heriot of the u.s. commission on civil rights says new research indicates that race-preferential admissions to america  s top universities are hurting those they are supposed to help.  if this research is right, we now have fewer minority science and engineering graduates than we would have under race neutral admissions policies,   heriot said in an amicus brief filed along with fellow commissioners peter kirsanow and todd gaziano.  we have fewer minority college professors .  .  . fewer minority lawyers too.  on the other hand, the american educational research association says it isn  t so.   research continues to show that student body diversity leads to important educational benefits,   the group, along with other research associations, said in its amicus brief to the court.the supreme court has received 92   friend of the court   briefs filed in fisher v. university of texas, which it will hear tuesday, seventy three on behalf of ut and the rest supporting fisher or in opposition to affirmative action. the point of these briefs is to inform the justices of the consequences.abigail noel fisher, who is white, says she was denied admission to ut in 2008 while the university  s policy resulted in african american and hispanic students with lesser credentials being admitted.ut says race is just one of many characteristics it considers in a   holistic   review of some applicants to build a diverse class, as governed by past supreme court decisions.  the amicus briefs explain to the court the importance of what the decision means to everyone else. in this case, not just the 50,000 students at ut,   but to students in universities across the country, said lisa s. blatt, an attorney who has appeared frequently before the supreme court.abigail thernstrom, another civil rights commission member, says affirmative action undermines race relations   by heightening stereotypes and creating greater separation and self-segregation between racial groups.  she adds that the preferences create disincentives for black and hispanic students to work hard and they increase those students     self-doubts about their abilities to succeed academically.  ucla law professor richard sander, and journalist stuart taylor jr. in a new book and in a brief to the court, say there are wide academic gaps between minority students admitted because of their race and their fellow students, and lead to lower grades and graduation rates and cause some students to switch to less-challenging majors.http://www.examiner.com/article/u-s-supreme-court-to-decide-the-fate-of-affirmative-action
3728,i started out with flashing in the left eye and one floater, i'm 61, then about 2 months later i notice i have flashing also in my right eye, no floaters at this time.    i have a bad family history of macular degeneration, my mother, half sister, aunts, etc.    i went to an optometrist who checked for detacted retina and macular    thing were ok, then flashing right side also, i went back and again no macular or detacted retina.    should i also go to:    ophthalmologist?    is flashing directly related to heavy weight, blood pressure, and diabetics?this discussion is related toflashing lights in eyes.

3730,i was seeing this guy for over 2 years and he kept wanting to do anal or give him head or have sex all the time he knew about my past and what happened in my past was when i was 5 till i was 8 my dad would make me give him head and i still wake up to this day at night with the fear that its happening all over again and i tried to give my ex head but i started crying because when i went to look up at him i seen my dad and i cant do it and the anal thing from when i was 6-8 when my mom and dad was at work me and my brothers would have a babysitter and he would do anal with me when he would put us down for bed and i cant do that and i dont like sex because from 10 to 20 i had always been raped by more than one person. well back to the story but because i wouldnt give him head or do anal or have sex with him all the time he would get mad and upset so i ended it with him and no he wont leave me alone saying im the best he ever had and stuff like that but i left him because he would always bug me about doing those things and i cant. did i do the right thing by ending it with him??? and will i ever be able to enjoy sex or will i always have the fear that someone is going to rape me again?
3731,hi im from cape town and im very much addicted to sex    and porn, i have lost my girlfriends due to my addiction.what should i do.
3732,sometimes when i masterbate, i have different outcomes, sometimes it burns when i ejaculate, at times after i ejaculate, there is a pain around my pubic bone area. and i dont understand why. i have had blood taken last year, and i am clean, i do not use drugs, or anything, when i have sex i am always using protection.
3733,this question is actually about my husband, as i worry about his health.    he is 41 years old, weighs about 215 pounds and is 5'10 tall.    he finally went to the doctor for the first time in about 10 years for an ear ache.    the doctor did standard bloodwork and checked his cholesterol.    the first time the results came back, the doctor thought they made a mistake and had my husband re-tested.    again, his results came back as an overall cholesterol of 91.    i've read articles that cholesterol that is too low is also bad for you and tried to explain to my husband that he should follow up with the physician and ask more questions.    i have to add that he drinks alcohol daily (6-9 beers) and smokes pot several times per week.    i'm worried that he is going to ignore something that may be important, just because his bloodwork says that his cholesterol is great.    any advice is welcome.thanks.

3738,so my son is 6 and he can be the absolute sweetests kid ever, but most of the time, he literally stresses me out due to his behavior. he interupts any conversation or physical contact i have with my husband, he says no a lot, he never wants to go to bed, he never wants to eat or try new things,he has gotten in trouble at school a couple time now from being loud or figting in the bathroom, he wont tell me how he feels or why....and so on....                                             once i punish him for his behavior he cries a lot and then he is calm, for a little bit. i just don't know what to do? i have tried reading with him,playing a game with him,drawing with him....everything. he is an only child, but i really try to give him so much attention and love, and the way he acts, you would think i lock him in his room all day everyday?                also, he is really smart here at home when we do homework, but the teacher is telling me he is behind? he literally does all his homework correctly before i can even try to help him? how is he a genius here and bottom of the class at school? anyway, i need some advice, i am so stressed out over him, i just can't figure it out on my own.
3739,my daughter is five, she's in preschool for a speech delay, that's almost gone. at the last parent meeting the teachers brought up some issues that i don't really think are a problem. when its time for stations, if my daughter wants to do a certain one, but they want her to do a different one first she gets upset. or when she's in speech and they're playing a game, once her turn is over she kinda turns and finds something else to do till it is her turn again. she's not hyper active or anything like that, i just think its her personality. i also think maybe its just that she's five. i don't have a huge problem with her at home, the biggest thing is we cut sugar, cause that makes her a little crazy. any advice, or thoughts would be helpful. just kinda want to know if anyone elses five year old is kinda the same.
3740,every action a person takes in the united states is regulated by the government. many of these regulations go unnoticed. but think about every action you take and the bureau-   cra tic agency regulating it. from brushing your teeth to watering your lawn, the government has intruded and regulated every action you take. but how did we end up in a society that has allowed itself to be regulated across the board?we live in an age where the government fears the people. and rightfully so. they hustle our paychecks, bailout zombie corporations against the wishes of the public, and send our money overseas to pointless causes. clearly, this government has taken many actions that are not supported by the people that pay for them.many people argue that we are rewarded richly for government pilfering via public schools, defense and road systems, to name just a few government projects. but many of these services, if not all, could be provided with better quality and cheaper prices through the private sector.which leads one to wonder why we never hear privatization advocated by our politicians? why should people always look to government for solutions to modern day problems such as the bp spill cleanup, instead of private companies that could do the same work better and cheaper?wise economists from the austrian school of thought blame this blind support of government intervention on a phenomenon known as   the people  s romance.   this phenomenon shows people are drawn to government in a way that allows government to take actions most would object to if they understood what truly free society is. if the average citizen was to closely examine the complete control government wields over one  s life, investigating the effects of each nanny state regulation, they would most likely object to the power government has.through   the people  s romance,   the government consolidates power by controlling focal points in one  s life. people become dependent, so they think, on the plethora of government services that are provided. government officials exploit the services to win support in elections. most politicians argue expanding certain services to further consolidate power, but rarely do we see a politician argue privatization of these services. to privatize would mean that the government would lose access to influence every facet of your life.currently,   the people  s romance   is on the rise in america. with the obama administration  s expansion of power through insane amounts of frivolous spending via   the stimulus   and the complete takeover of the health care sector, government influence over one  s life seems to be the only thing growing in 2010. the government would rather hide the fact that they have mired the economy through their incessant, destructive interventions then risk losing the ever-expanding control they wield over society.if we want a society that is free of an encroaching government that impedes individual freedom, we must look to the private sector for answers to today  s problems not to government bureaucrats interested in gaining more power. we must remember that only the private sector can deliver the results that government has proven time and again it is unable to do. and above all, the private sector removes bad business actors from the marketplace efficiently while government props them up by bailing them out with your money and the money of future generations.there is nothing wrong with supporting government. but there is something very wrong with a government that wants to regulate your every action. don  t let your romantic feelings of government cloud your lens of viewing what congress and obama are really after.adam bitely is the editor-in-chief of netrightdaily.com.http://www.oaoa.com/opinion/action-49672-every-government.html

3742,if any gamers are reading this, i was wondering what your favorite video game(s) is (are). thanks! :)i'll post my favorite games first. ;)
3743,i have a big problem on my hands here. i have a blood phobia. when i see or even think about blood,i get very sick and almost pass out. this has prevented me from seeing a dentist and i have a very bad tooth abscess right now. my left lower canine tooth has been hurting for a whole week now and today it was the worst. i have to take 1600 mg of ibuprofen in 12 hours and then i take 1000 mg of tylenol just to numb the pain somewhat. this has been causing side effects..my stomach is upset and i noticed that my urine was green several times. but i don't know what to do about this pain. if i was not afraid of blood,i would go to the dentist and get this tooth out but i would never be able to do it..even if i did it under sedation,there is still bleeding afterward and i would not be able to handle that.so,can anyone here tell me,what are my options? i am a 28 year old male with some heart issues and this pain is causing very high blood pressure and i do not want to do damage to my heart.    thanks.
3744,i just returned from my 3month check-up.i have had 3 surgeries,the last being with the silicone oil. my vision has not been restored and now the dr. says it will not get better. i am thinking of goin to mayo clinic.looking for some advice ,
3745,what does this mean?    my dr. writes in his notes that we discussed monocular precautions in all of my appointments, and we don't!    i always mean to ask him, but he's in and out of there so fast i don't get the chance!
3746,recently had ultrasound. during the ultrasound i was told my uterus was very large about 25 cm. they couldn't see the ovaries. there was something most likely fibroid and its size was close to 13 cm. do you know what would be the next step that would be taken in such situations? what would be the available options for me. i would like to have kids. i'm 37 right now. i already researched online and looked at all the treatment options. i know some of the options will lower fertility rate or diminish it completely. please advise. the technician said the uterus was so large she couldn't see the ovaries and she could measure something that was 13 cm and there could be more smaller ones. from my understanding with large fibroids the best thing is to do an mri to see the exact locations and how many there are plus everything will show up in mri including ovaries as well as whether the problem is fibroids or adenomyosis (also whether there are cancerous findings). i don't have heavy bleeding, just longer periods (light after a few days, but lasts long), & frequent urination.
3747,apparently, this 18-year-old boy was dating a 16-year-old, which is still legal. she sent some nude pictures to his email as a surprise. after an argument, late one night, he got vindictive and sent some of the pictures to the contacts on her email address. the next day, police showed up and confiscated everything digital that he owned and arrested him. he is now labeled a sex offender, and will be 43 before he can approach the courts about repealing the felony charge and title.imo, this is ridiculous. he was a jerk, absolutely, but this goes overboard, way above and beyond what he should have been charged with. this sexting (taking nude pictures of oneself and using digital media such as phones or email to send the image to others) is out of control, first of all, but to charge someone that i still consider on the edge of childhood as a sex offender over something so very small? i find it absolutely ridiculous. obviously he was an adult and should be punished legally for doing something he had no business doing, morally or legally, but to carry the felony title of sex offender for more than 20 years? i can't even fathom how this is proportional to the crime. he also has to attended mandatory therapy once a week, discussing such issues as why rape is wrong and what sexual abuse does to the victim. this seems wrong to me, and everyone here knows that i have no tolerance for sexual predators...but i don't see this guy as being that bad.
3748,i had to have a root canal december 4, 2007 for a tooth which had a very large filling in it.    after the dentist gave me an injection of novacaine, i have no feeling in the tip of my tongue and along the right side of my tongue.    i am afraid i will never regain the sensation in my tongue again.    can you tell me if this is normal, and if so, how long it will take for the feeling to return?    i'm thinking my dentist did something wrong to cause this, although he is adamant that he did not.    i have more dental work that needs to be done, but am afraid to continue.    i have had numerous fillings, two previous root canals, and have never had this experience before.    please help me find some answers.

3754,my wife was hospitalized for her gout flaring up on her right ankle in ct. she was admitted on a thursday for the pain by her dr. 24hrs later after her admission the left side of her face swelled up and her eye was completely shut. after 4 days in the hospital and no change in her swelling she was transferred to another hospital in boston, mass were she was a patient for 16 days. they took care of the swelling, but she lost her vision to her left eye. i've spoken to numerous doctors about this and they don't understand why she would have permanent eye loss. an eye dr. saw her and told us that she has permanent eye loss due to her optic nerve damage. i don't agree with the evaluation, so i'm looking for another opinion and someone that can help her get her vision back. also do you think it was negligence on the hospital's part, they told us that she got a staff infection.

3757,i'm really hoping someone can advise me..the main problem is i am british but live in france and my french isn't up to quizzing dr's on benefits of various iol's and i will need one soon - i don't want to make amassive mistake or miss out because i am not aware of all options . i'm female and just 36 years old.i have small posterior subcapsular cataracts and myopia of -9 left eye, -10 right eye. i have moderate to terrible floaters in right eye (have reached tipping point where vitrectomy might be only option) - very mild floaters in left eye which, if they didn't worsen, i could quite happily live with forever and no way would i risk a vitrectomy for. apparently my retina is 'amazingly good' for a high myope (not sure if that's important - but hey, at least its a some good news!).i would like an iol in my right eye in the next few months - if i am honest, i must say i have a tiny secret hope it will positively affect floaters or the improvement in vision may detract from them . i feel left eye might be able to wait a couple of years or even more. is an accomodative lens out of the question for a patient of -10 bearing in mind i am in europe? i think by the time the left eye needs doing accomodative lenses for high myopes will be available and i feel that if i have amono in one eye and an accomodative lens in the other i will feel unbalanced and perhaps suffer eye strain or headaches.in hope!
3758,my daughter had complained of poor vision in her left eye for the past week or so,on going to the hospital this morning and seeing the eye specialist he has told her she has fluid behind the eye,and he will do further tests in a months time. should this be seen too more urgently, or is follow up in a months time o.k.thankyou
3759,i am currently in the process of getting a court ordered visitation schedule with my lil ones father. he was mostly absent in his life for the first two years.    at almost age 2.5 he started requesting to spend time with him after the state became involved with child support. although the original motive might not have been great, it was a good thing for my lil one as he was finally spending time with his child. the problem now is that he is on a path to try to reduce support by going after 50/50 custody. and although i am very happy my lil one has finally gotten to know the other half of the family which includeds two step brothers. the transition has been really difficult. i allowed my self to get pushed into giving more visitation than i really felt was good for my lil one out of fear he would try to get joint. we currently have a thurs - monday schedule 2 times with in the 2 week period of time he is home. (he works out of town for two weeks a month). by the end of this schedule its very emotionally stressfful to my lil one.    on several instances has even regressed and had poop and pee accidents. my lil one has been fully potty trained since age two. had a similiar happening the first time i had to go out of state for training. that time my lil one was with their grandparents who have a very close relationship to my lil one. and even then around day 5 or so there was pooping accidents.has anyone else seen these type of regressions? are there ways to try and make the transition easier with less stress when the non primary parent isnt easy to work with?
3760,i am probably going to cause a lot of sparks with my post, just trying to get a better idea of my options.okay, i'm 22 years old living at home because of college and my father is an alcoholic. i never thought he was until after i graduated high school went to basic training and then came home to find my dad had really changed. we use to go to friends and drinks and that was always fun, never had a problem. over the last four years he has really gone downhill, he makes no sense, comes home drunk and finds anything and everything to complain about and is even getting forgetful, not to mention he's always complaining of some type of stomach problem and he looks pregnant (famous beer belly). the thing is he is in strong denial and has adapted a morning dependecy not just beer like bloody mary's and jd. there is no talking to    him anymore. my father and i use to be really close and after he came home drunk and criticized everything about me and acts like the world is out to get him i just can't hold a conversation with him anymore and it's really hurtful. if i try to talk to him about it sober or not he turns it around to saying i really hurt his feelings. it's been like that for almost 2years now.the situation has yet worsend. my mother is completely against drinking and of course my father hides it, until he come home and can't hide it and then it usually turns into a big blow out. well, back in november i was pulled over and had been drinking, yes of course i was arrested for a dui. i wasn't drunk but had enough in me, ( i was pulled over for not having my lights on, something i always do) i was out and just wanted to go home and go to bed, i should've just waited another half an hour and i woudn't be in the situation i am now. not point into going into that i made a bad choice and i have accepted the consequences.i thought my mom was going to freak out on me, she didn't. she has of course said you've done this to yourself....but i know you dont have a problem and don't drink that much unlike your father, you'll get through this just fine. coming from my mom this really shocked me. i have found out that she was hoping my situation would help my father realize how easy it is even when you are attempting to me (somewhat) responsible and careful. it has not and instead my fathers drinking of course has only gotten worse. after he picked me up, i asked him if he was disappointed,    i was told no, things happen. what!?! i mean granted anything anyone can say to me can not amount to the disappointment i have in myself but still, aren't parents supose to say something?i am not sure what my real issue is with all of this. i have been court order to go through a few classes and be on probation. ( i have no counseling and am not interested in seeking any for personal reasons) the classes really opened my eyes and the whole time the only thing i could think of was my dad and how his alcoholism has affected us. he told my mom that he knows who started me drinking, i never drank regularly until i started drinking with him ( she does not know this, and i want to save her the pain of that) after it first happened he was all about helping me out and everything, i stuck to it that i did this to myself and will make it through it on my own. i of course lossed my license for a time period and that has been the only time i have gone to anyone for help, transportation to work and classes. my dad has gone to my mom saying i've asked him for money and how he refused to give it to me, this never happened and never will.i know i'm at risk for alcoholism because of my father and have always known that and everything that has happened up to this point has really enforced my want to not turn out like that. i am disguisted with myself and yes i do kind of blame him alittle bit and know he feels guilty but i find i am more disguisted in him. sometimes i wish probation would come and check on me when his in one of his drunken rants so he could be right where i am and maybe some type of intervention would be to save his health and his family.my mother and i talk more now about his situation and the affects of it. as much as my dad thinks that i am dependt on my parents my mom sees that i am not that and that i working really hard. i graduated college in june, have been working the same job for almost 3years, am starting to look for another part job and as it is looking i will be released from being monitored by the court system early. stuff is really going to get deep after i graduate in june and when the cold hard fact of me moving becomes a reality whether it be earlier then planned or in the fall. i feel that the only way to break away from all of this is to walk away and never look back, i really do not want to do that but i can't see it any other way. suggestion, advice and opinions or any similiar situations?

3762,i have a small bump on my eye in between the color of my eye and my nose. its small but not very yellow. i wear hard contacts. should i wear them still?
3763,this past week i suddently had the floaters(quite big one, clear bubble like) and flash lights in my left eye and went to see my eye doctor.    he found no retinal detachment.    however, 3 hours after the check, i had allergic reaction to the dialating drops (which happened before, this is 2nd time, i mentioned it to the dr.    before the test, he said he is using different drop).    both my eyes turned very bloody red, swollen, and teary now. (looks scary)i worry to    go back to have follow up check in 3 weeks for floaters.    is there any other type of drops or ways they can use to check my eye ?    this allergic reaction bothered my very much.    it took me a while to recover for the last time.    at the same time,    i am afraid that this reaction will make current situation worse to cause detachment.is the steroid drop good ?    is it going to cause glucoma later ?    any other way to treat this allergic reaction ?    can i take benedryl orally ?also is taking flight ok for people having floaters/flash lights, will flight make it worse ?please advise,    thanks !!
3764,metal theft is not a new phenomenon in the u.s., nor is it a surprising one given the state of the economy. but a thief or group of thieves in north beaver township, pennsylvania, has raised the bar by stealing a 50-foot-long by 20-foot-wide bridge for scrap metal, according to pennsylvania state police.authorities say the privately owned covert's crossing bridge, which was made of corrugated steel, has been valued at approximately $100,000 and was dismantled using a blowtorch sometime between september 27 and october 5. the pittsburgh tribune-review reports that it contained a steel web decking along with steel i-beam supports.  its old i-beams are probably hundreds and hundreds of pounds per foot,   nearby resident robert obed told cnn affiliate wtae-tv in pittsburgh.   it  s an old railroad bridge.  covert's crossing is in a remote wooded area of the rural township, which is home to 4,000 people about 50 miles north of pittsburgh. the bridge had been around since the early 1900s and was owned by new castle development, who told the pittsburgh post-gazette that the company had recently closed off public access to the crossing because of reports of copper theft in the area. company spokesman gary bruce said that bridge was primarily used by a nearby business to transport materials, but there is an alternative route that is still accessible.bridge theft, while certainly rare, is not unheard of. in 2008, a group of russian thieves managed to dismantle and haul off a 200-ton, 38-foot steel bridge in just one night, according to a report from britain's daily mail.source:http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/07/thieves-dismantle-cart-off-steel-bridge-in-pennsylvania/?hpt=us_c2
3765,hi, my boyfriend and i are both turning 18 closer to the end of the year, we have been together for 25 months now and have been having sex for roughly 1 year and a half. everything has always been fine everytime, even the first time, which was the first time for both of us, went perfectly, i bled a little bit but not much at all. but the last two times we had sex, i was bleeding a little bit afterwards, not heavy and not for long, but it still makes me worry. he thinks i should go to the doctors about it, but the doctors i go to are of a different race and are very strict about no sex until after marriage, so i know i wouldn't feel comfortable talking to them about it, and my mum and i aren't that close, so that leaves me with no one else to talk to about it.. can someone please help me? if its serious, or could be, i want to know as soon as possible so i can do something about it quicker.
3766,my 9 year old son had some dental work done today.    he had 5 fillings on one side of his mouth.    they used nitrous oxide and said that he should be totally relaxed and do just fine.    3 of my other children have had nitrous oxide for fillings and did just fine.    however my son today vomited during the procedure.    which they immediately extracted with their suction.    they said that this does happen some times.    in looking this over at information online, i have seen it say that this occurs when over sedation occurs.    my son remembers that he vomited, but what seems to bother him most is he said he was so dizzy and felt like he was spinning the whole time.    and that he was in a inclosed small space the whole time.    so i'm assuming he was claustrophobic.    he has to go back to get a few more fillings, and i'm wondering if he should not have the nitrous oxide?    has anyone out there ever experienced vomiting during the procedure when having the laughing gas?    my other concern is if he doesn't have it, and he starts to gag or vomit that he'll freak out if he isn't lightly sedated.    i know from watching it, it was so scary to see him lying there vomiting, and not being able to do anything to help him, other than comforting him.    any advice would greatly be appreciated.    thank you!

3771,http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/09/chef-allegedly-cooked-wife-four-daysa los angeles-area chef currently on trial for the murder of his wife told police that he used his professional skills in the kitchen to dispose of the body by slow-cooking her remains for four days.david viens, of lomita, calif., finally revealed the gruesome truth to sheriff's investigators who had been searching for his wife, dawn, 39, following her disappearance on october 18, 2009, reported the los angeles times.i just slowly cooked it and i ended up cooking her for four days, revealed viens in a taped confession from march 2011 describing the grisly disposal of the body in a 55-gallon drum, which was played for jurors tuesday. i manipulated her so the face was down, and i took some - some things - like weights that we use, and i put them on the top of her body.i just slowly cooked it and i ended up cooking her for four days. i let her cool. i strained it out.when asked by sgt. richard garcia what triggered the vicious attack, 49-year-old viens replied: for some reason i just got violent, because his wife had been raising hell in their apartment and he just wanted to sleep, he then went on to explain how he bound her hands and feet and duct-taped her mouth. and that was it. i said, 'good night.'viens told police that he had previously taped her up to prevent her from driving around wasted, whacked out on coke and drinking.when he woke up in a panic the next morning and realized what he had done, the culinary expert came up with the idea of getting rid of her body in the heavy duty equipment to collect used cooking grease and oil, which is later sucked out by a disposal company.after pouring seven or eight pounds of grease from the drum into his grease trap using a trash bag, the murder suspect told detectives that he took his wife's skull and jaw in one piece and hid it in the attic of his mother's torrance home. the rest of the remains were placed in trash bags and he buried them in the trash cans behind his restaurant.viens has not revealed exactly where the cold-hearted act took place, but it has been implied it was at the thyme cafe restaurant in lomita, between torrance and san pedro in los angeles county.the graphic confession was made while viens was hospitalized after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in palos verdes in a suspected suicide attempt, but he has since pleaded not guilty to his wife's murder. he was so severely severely injured in the jump that he is attending his murder trial in a wheelchair.
3772,i recently got engaged to my boyfriend who i have been dating for almost 3 years now. we are getting married in 2 months   time. everything was going well and i was busy shopping and preparing for the big day! i travelled to another town for shopping with my mom over the weekend. i needed to get back for work on monday while mom was gonna stay longer. my fianc  did not want me to travel alone as he is very protective about me.    so i lied to him saying i had a friend coming with me. the lie was very trivial and only so that he does not worry too much about me. however he knows me in and out. and figured by the way i was talking that there was something fishy. so i accepted that i lied and told him everything. this has hurt him a lot as he trusted me blindly and changed the way he looks at me. he doesn  t want to trust me anymore and does not care. (at least he says so) he has a tendency of saying mean things to make me realize my mistakes. he is also fed up of giving me chances as i have been and done stupid things in the past. this situation has screwed up any excitement regarding the wedding. i desperately want things to be ok. but i know that it ll take time. how can i handle this situation in the best way. i ve already apologized and promised that i would never lie again.
3773,i'm about 5'5 and 230 and i have started a food journal a couple months ago with eating around 1500-1700 calories per day, and i am incorporating a lot of the healthier foods into my system including going to the gym. but it's been lately that at night i'm waking up with severe abdominal and stomach pains. and i feel that i need to eat again, but in a way i don't want to eat. and i'm not sure what's causing this, or how i can at least lessen it. i do eat three medium sized meals per day with snacking on veggies and fruits throughout. but i'm at a loss as to what to do, and having to get up early is hard enough knowing that i'm awake at night with the pains. any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.thank you
3774,i moved to new mexico about 4 years ago.    since i moved here i have had a hard time getting contacts in which i can see out of my right eye.    i have a astigmatism which is worse in my right eye.    the doctors seem to take my glasses and set up their equipment and then after a couple of a or b flips boom there is my prescription.    then they order trial pair after trial pair and say that it depends on how the lens centers on my eye.    my right eye vision is so blurry i can't read a highway sign.    it doesn't seem to matter what brand they order.    i am very angry and frustrated.
3775,during the last year my right eye has been getting blury, i'm seeing lights like tracing lights so i'm wondering is this a sign that my detachment is getting worse? i have no insurance to fix the problem. can these things stay the same or will i just lose my vision in this eye?
3776,my daughter (age 21) has been getting mild fever every evening for the last 1 month. all blood test have provided normal results. confused. please help. otherwise she is ok during the day and carries out her daily activities including travelling to college etc. without any probelm. however, every evening she gets low due to this fever. doctor's medicines have been taken and he has asked for re-test of blood etc. in the coming week.
3777,i already asked this in the anxiety forum. but i'm just wondering if anyone has taken this herb for anxiety. and has it worked? it's called rauvolfia serpentina(sarpagandha)did it stop the anxiety symptoms such as an elevated heart rate?because i'm wondering if i should take it due to a situation that elevates the heart rate. i read that it decreases the heart rate. and prevents it from elevating by doing this:role of reserpine compound present in sarpgandha on central nervous system:reserpine works both in the central and the peripheral nervous systems to deplete stores of neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine at central and peripheral synapses, epinephrine in the adrenal glands, and serotonin (5-ht) in the cns. i'm not sure what this all means. i was just curious if it works.
3778,hi.    i have issues with mood (which i am trying to access support for).    earlier this year i was training regularly to run a half marathon.    i was doing well until several weeks before the event i sustained several blisters.since i have done no exercise and have eaten excessively.my goal was to complete a triathlon next year.what can i do to help me get from where i am now to achieving my goal next year?basically i feel stuck and psychotherapy would help that a great deal but accessing that is an ongoing process.my blisters have healed.    i had a calf strain soon after stopping but that too has healed.aside from the biomechanical stuff and the psych stuff what could i be doing to help my chances of succeeding next year?while the sports goal is important making long-term lifestyle changes is also a priority.(stress management, weight loss and maintenance, regular physical activity, etc).i have a basic sports background but just can't seem to translate my goals into action.    (can't stop eating, can't start exercising.    it's driving me nuts.)any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

3791,http://news.yahoo.com/connecticut-survivors-attend-school-neighboring-town-155145415.htmlnewtown, connecticut (reuters) - the children who survived friday's shooting at sandy hook elementary school will not have to return to the scene of the massacre when school reopens later this week and instead will attend classes in a neighboring connecticut town, newtown school officials said on sunday.it remains unclear when the 436 surviving students at sandy hook will return to class, but when they do it will be in an unused school about 7 miles to the south in monroe, newtown school superintendent janet robinson said.the town of monroe has graciously offered their chalk hill school, robinson said in a statement. this facility, which is currently not being used, is in excellent condition and will accommodate all of the sandy hill school students and staff.it is located just across the border from newtown and should be ready for occupancy in just a few days.all seven of newtown's public schools, which serve more than 5,100 students, as well as private schools in the district, will be closed on monday, school officials said late on saturday.officials were scrambling for ways to accommodate surviving students from what had been the town's largest elementary school, serving 5- to 10-year-olds in kindergarten through fourth grade. the public school remains an active crime scene.a newtown police officer expressed doubt the school could ever be used again.at this time it's too early to say. but i would find it very difficult for them to do that. certainly that's one of the things they're going to have to look into, lieutenant george sinko of the newtown police said at a news conference on sunday.
3792,heart rate staying higher than normal after exercise?i am 15 male. after some intense running today at basketball, very strenous and intense my heart rate stayed within the normal range( 60-100) but higher than normal. usually my resting heart rate is 68-75 beats per minute. but after i ran a lot at practice it rose to like 95-104 when i checked about an hour or 2 after runninglike its barely in the normal range. my blood pressure is normal and feel fine. i do not drink alot of water during running. but after the running today i drank about 4-5 cups of water till now. is it really dehydration? or could i be dehydrated which is causing this increase in heart rate.i have had 2 ekg['s and an echo done which came out normal for anxiety. i am still wondering why its been about 2 hours since the last time i ran like when will it start going down? is there something wrong? it has happened once before again with a lot of running it slowly step by step came back down to about 68-75 within 3-4 hours.also when i am at rest my heart rate is forceful and strong when it beats fast like this it is just like really fast with not much force in it. that might be stating the obvious but i dont know.it was down to about 90 as i write this question it is 80-85. like how long does it take to recover from dehydration i am constantly drinking water like i said 5 cups till now,
3793,madison, wisconsin.    does anyone remember the historic 2006 elections where americans finally sent a slate of legislators to washington to put the brakes on the radical extremist policies and war-machine of george w. bush (and remember, w stood for herbert walker -- this does matter).    just before that historic election, karl rove told npr that, despite polling data to the contrary, he had the math and that no meaningful change would happen.    what was he actually stating?last week, a video showed up on youtube -- a shot across the bow to highly-placed political insiders:    anonymous warns karl rove not to do it this time (h/t mark crispin miller).    after the jump, we will share this short video (1 min 37 sec).voices has inside information, direct from the source, that a statistically significant and definitive report will be released this week that will clearly demonstrate how official election results are not legitimate.    we have been told directly that the report is being released in the hope that, by identifying how honest and accurate vote counts are undermined -- karl rove (and others) will have to ditch a plan to steal the november 2012 elections.it appears the hacktivist group anonymous is also working to send rove and company the same message:anonymous is watching and will not stand down if karl rove and his crossroads pac overthrow our government by stealing the 2012 election.     rove has taken steps to ensure that americans believe this election is a close race -- too close to call.this provides cover to step in and rig the numbers to elect mitt romney and proclaim that, because it was a tight race, rove's candidate was able to squeak through a close election.if rove believes this -- he is making a mistake.    anonymous is watching closely and collecting highly technical data which, should the fix be in, be turned over to authorities in the hopes that rove will be prosecuted to the full-extent of the law.highly qualified and talented techies are monitoring key servers and internet traffic on each of theses servers for anything suspicious -- rove will not get away with any fraud without appropriate consequences.it will be best for karl rove, any co-conspirators, and america, for them not to even try to tamper with honest election results.http://voicesnewspaper.blogspot.com/2012/10/anonymous-warns-karl-rove-not-to-do-it.html to view the video

3803,i have been with my boyfriend for 4 1/2 yrs and i have noticed last march( during a exam) that i am starting to bleed slightly after we have sex. i am quite shock b/c we have been together for so long and this has never happened! we are trying to conceive a child, but with me bleeding i know this is a very bad sign! i also know that i probably won't be able to get pregnant! what can/should i do?
3804,my daughter has always had anger issues, settled down more so now. however she has outbursts now and again which can go on because she cannot calm herself down, she would shout at me or anyone else who intervened, slam doors, scream, end up almost being sick with temper.    i have tried different methods on dealing with this, now she seems to make personal oral attacks on her younger step brother who has a few personal issues, although she does not necessarily mean what she says to him she does so during a falling out between them.    she is well behaved otherwise and intelligent and excellent reports from school etc.     she is very much a thinker and i feel that she makes herself worse by think over issues or life in itself too much.    this is now affecting both her step brothers and step father.    she has always had a good life and has no reason to hate her life.
3805,my son will be six on the 28th of this month and has recently started kindergarten. the kindergarten experience has turned into a nightmare for me. we cannot go a day without a negative report from his teacher - he refuses to listen, disrupts the class, takes down things hanging on walls, bulletin boards, etc.., and has just yesterday cut a classmates hair. each night we discuss with him what is expected of him at school, the importance of respect and take away privileges when he comes home with a negative report. so far, nothing has seemed to work. his response is always it's too hard to make good decisions. i am at my wit's end. i don't know what else to do. i'm not even sure where i have gone wrong. i am completely overwhelmed. i need some advice. thank you.
3806,my son started about two months ago having extreme anxiety over sleeping, refusing to sleepin his room and keeps up for hours until we end up bringing him in the living room with us, this was sudden onset and awful for all of us, he has always had symptoms of adhd but he was a sweet and smart boy so we just tried to deal with it, we did not want him on medications, within the past couple of months he has lost friends at school due to his behavior and his teacher and school forced us to get him on medication, concerta 18mg, since starting things seem to be worse including his sleep, i don;t want him medicated day and nigtht, what eles can we do? is this not adhd? we have an appointment with a behavior specialist next week but i feel so lost for him and frustrated, help!!!
3807,my son is now 3 years old-but after reading some of the topics on here-i thought i should ask about some things that have concerned me. for about the last year-he has been very interested in his genital area. he plays with himself many times-almost every time he is in the tub or in the shower or naked anytime. it has gotten so bad a few times that i noticed noises coming from him as if going in to full pleasure with the situation. i am concerned about the behavior and where at 2 years old he could have discovered this, learned this or whatever. coming from a sexually abusive home myself-i am very keen on anything sexual like this that it literally scares me to death that i perhaps failed as a parent and exposed either one of my children (i have a 7 year old daughter too) to something so horrible.my question is--at what age is this type of touching normal? can it happen at any age? and how do you determine if there is any other underlying issue whent he child is so young? he talks very well--but i have chatted with him briefly without bringing too much attention into the matter--but he says he learned it nowhere.my biggest goal here is to make sure my kids are safe. i would like to know what to look out for and perhaps gather some reassurance to the situation--or information to make me take action.any advice would be great.thanks.
3808,anybody seen them anywhere.    they aren't on e-bay.    i looked.    they are those 6 pieces of thick yarn that was twisted and came in different colors to use as pony tails in your hair in the late 60's - 70's???a member of the thyroid community was wondering if anybody knows where to buy them and i offered to do a poll here on social to see if we can help her!c~

3810,since he first started to run, my grandson keeps looking right or left to watch his shadow, rather than looking at what is in front of him. now he's riding his bike, and this habit is even more dangerous. he's told his mother that he's trying to stop doing it, but he can't help himself.any ideas how to help him stop or what might be causing this?
3811,my daughter is almost 4. she is always on the go. she gets hurt all the time from not slowing down. i am always telling her to calm down or slow down. i give her time outs and take toys away, but this does not seem to help. i cannot seem to keep a sitter for her. every time she goes to a sitter after a couple weeks they tell me they can not watch her anymore because they cannot handle her. she does a lot of screaming, climbing, throws anything she can get her hands on, hurts other people, will not walk (runs everywhere), and gets into everything she possibly can. i stopped giving her naps, hoping this would take some of her energy away. it did not. it is very difficult to get her to settle down enough to get her asleep every night. last year she pulled a 250 pound electric fireplace over on herself, crushing her face and back of her skull. she was playing in the middle of the living room, i left her with my 8 year-old son and my boyfriends 11 year-old son long enough to flip sausage i was cooking for breakfast. i heard a loud crash and the boys scream. i ran into the living room finding her pinned under the fireplace. i do not want her to keep getting hurt. when she hurt on a daily basis. i am afraid she will get hurt really bad or worse. most of the she hurts her head or back. she will be starting preschool in august. i do not know what to do to calm her down. please help me. does anyone know what i can do?
3812,hey everyone, :-)i've had problems since sept 2006 and it's getting worse as of the past few months.    i'm going for my first gyn oncologist appt thursday march 13th.    i'm wondering if it's his decision if i can and should have some sort of hysterectomy or if it can be mine???????????????????????i've had so many problems ( you can read my page if ya want) and don't want to do a little fix here and there and keep going back over and over again for more to be removed.    is it my right to have this surgery or is it totally up to the doctors and insurance?????????????    does anybody know, because i want to be ready with knowledge on thursday?????i recently learned about radical hysterectomy which i would never think to do, but cervical cancer issue's run in my family with my oldest sister, my mom and my other sister is being watched with something in her cervix and now my 22 year old daughter is having cervical issue's.    i don't want to have to go back for something in the future.also, what are the real down sides from your experiences of having a hysterectomy?    i would love to hear from women who have been through this.    i have talked with women a little that live near me and they all say it's awesome and they'd do it all over again.    some had partial, one a full and one i think was radical.    i thought a full hysterectomy was everything, but i was wrong.......    lolhoping to get some answers soon as my appointment with the oncologist is the day after tomorrow...............    yicks.............thank you all...........in advance.    :-)
3813,i have a 7 year old boy that has many accidents in school and daycare, like when he is at home he waits for the last minute before going to the washroom but then its to late and he has done it in his pants, he sleeps the whole night and does not wet the bed or anything...do you have any advice for me??
3814,i'm having problems with 'leaky bags' during the night and have been buying incontinence sheets for bed but was wondering if i would be able to get these free on prescription?
3815,i want to know if this is normal, some foods he chews and most he holds in his mouth for hours. it doesn't matther what it is, it could be yogurt to orange juice he will hold it in his mouth.    he is so picky all he will eat is gold fish crackers, peanut butter crackers, yogurt and baby oatmeal.    if they hadn't invented kid essentials (boost) i would have gone crazy by now.     anyone have the same experience or suggestions, please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3816,i have a friend that has two children, the girl is 2 and the boy is 3.    the little boy displays very bad behavior at times.    he throws tantrums, kicks, screams, breaks things, and even talks back.    you can tell him to do something and that if he doesn't the consequences and he will tell you that he will do the same consequences to you.    he is about to get put out of his school, because he has kicked the wall in, spit on the other kids as well as the teachers, he breaks toys, and hits the other kids.    she doesn't know what to do with him at this point.    she's a single mom and doesn't have much help from their father.    she is thinking he may have adhd or may need some kind of help from a doctor, possibly medicine.    can you recommend anything at all?    i try to help as much as possible.    but she really needs help.    thank you
3817,my fianc  caught my son humping her daughter with there pants down. he is five she is three. we never do sexual things in front of them because we do not not want them to be exposed to that at such a young age. he goes with his real mother three days a week and i have no idea what goes on over there. he has told me stories of what he saw his mom doing. but he is five so i do not know if i should believe him or not. my fianc  took his toys and sat him in time out tell i got home from work. i caught him one other time doing this with his boy cousin that is the same age and i spanked him and took his toys and didn't let them play in the same room. now my fianc  is thinking about leaving me because she can not handle seeing him. should i take him to see a doctor to find out what is going on with him. i am so lost with all this and it being a day before christmas.
3818,my son was diagnosed with pddnos at 5, then adhd at 7, then back to pddnos with adhd as a comorbid condition at 10 years. he has been having seizures since he was 3. he has    speech/language delay, poor attention, poor social thinking and limited interests and he struggles with reading.         he is better at math. he simply can't plan and start a project, remember the details and complete the task. he is in a partially mainstreamed special education program.    he is 10 years old now. he has had 3 grandmals so far and about 2-3 complex partial seizure episides per year.he    has taken iq tests at 5 years and at 7 years    from the school and from neuropsycologists. all 4 tests revealed    below average - range ( around 87 ) for intelligence and mild impairment for executive/cognitive skills.he did pretty well in school for the last two years. he was bright and happy to participate. he had started blooming really well. his meds were changed in april to get better seizure control. we got seizure control but the side effects were bad. it feels as if his asd and adhd issues have worsened.    the school year had barely started, they administered a series of tests including kaufman assesment battery for children - 2nd edition.first of all, it takes him 15 minutes to just sit and start working on a problem he knows how to do. it takes him a lot more time to warm up to a new unpredictable situation    and give his undivided attention. on top of it, he is not good at responding to    open ended questions due to his communication problems.     he is better at multiple choice questions and visual questions.when i expressed all these concerns, the district said it was just a routine test.anyways, they say that his iq has dropped to 60.    the only thing that has changed since the last test was that     he was hospitalized from a grand mal    2 years back, which was treated immediately and no long-term issues cropped up from that. it was confirmed by a series of medical tests.i have 3 questions. 1. given the    list of issues (attention, language, asd and low motivation) my son has, has the school administered the    right iq test ?    2. can iq drop so significantly?     3. are there alternate iq tests for kids with asd and adhd?also, should i just take the iq test results with a grain of salt and continue working with him as usual? my only worry is that his already low bar at school will be lowered even more. his teacher has already stopped sending him to science and art classes because he can't handle them. he had started enjoying learning about sea animals. she just wants to work on his reading and math goals.sorry about the lengthy post.
3819,my son (ruhaan)is 4 years + and goes to nursery school now.    he has been in the play school previously for seven months.    while the play school teachers gave feed back that be talks very less now for some times i have notices that he does not speak to anybody other than family members.    when checked with the present school the teacher as well as principal told me that ruhaan does not talk to anybody and he gives very short, to the point, answers to the questions. i fear whether he is having selective mutism problem.    other wise he is above average inteligent.    he has a very good vocabolary.    he speaks very well can pronounce each and every word clearly.    in fact when he was only two he was able to speak more than 1000 words.    i dont know what should i do right now.    everything elese is quite normal.    his motor skills are quite good. sleeps well eats well not bad habbits etc.please help me.
3820,my grand daughter who is    4 year old, do not show any interest or whatsoever to take food or milk right from the early days. her parents try to feed her with great effort but the child doesnt cooperate. the attending doctor says that there is no problem with the child as long as she is active. the child is very active and hale , but very lean.hardly she eats 4 to 5 spoons of food and a half glass of milk. thats    all.not more than that. please advise us how to turn the mind of the child to eat properly the food    and drink milk regularly.
3821,my daughter is in her third year of school (2nd grade) & we have received the same complaint from each teacher.    she is easily frustrated & subjects or problems which she may have been doing with ease for weeks can, on any given day, become a crisis.    upon posing a problem (new or old) she will instantaneously cry out i can't do it!, bury her head in her hands, & either cry, groan, stomp her feet, or throw herself on the floor (yes, even in the middle of her peers in the school room).    we, & the teachers, both agree she is a very bright girl & can do the hardest problems with ease when she isn't disposed to these fits.    unfortunately, these outbursts seem to be increasing in frequency.    we moved from the u.s. to europe in sept 2006 immersing her in a dutch school adding stress & pressures, and although they have increased recently she's portrayed this behavior from very early in life.    (fyi: she is now fluent, speaking & reading in both languages; the teacher admits better than most natives in her class.)    she has always had a tendency to want to do things perfect the first time and would rather stand at the back of her ballet class to watch the rest of the girls until the third - last class when she could join the dance with perfect choreography.    she is normally happy & pronounced bright & social by most, but anyone who tries to teach her something school related or otherwise will see her shut down followed by some temper tantrum.    her teachers & parents are finally at their wits end.    we've both tried all spectrums from being overly sweet and understanding to getting angry and forcing her to do the problem.    neither of these, nor anything in between have unlocked her brain or pulled her back to reason during these daily moments.what is this and how can we work her through it?
3822,my almost 5 year old daughter has informed me several times, the most recent time yesterday that she hears voices talking quietly in her head.    this last voice she explained was while she was at preschool and it quietly said, stupid.     i think previously it has said things like, spongebob or maybe sang a familiar song.i know it sounds silly... but she very clearly described the voice as coming from her own head.    i have three children a 4 year old, her (5 years old) and a 7 year old.    all girls.    all very different.     i'm a single parent and have absolutely no experience with anything like this.. i don't really know what to tell her...like i said, she brought it up recently like she was a little worried.    i didn't know what to say.    i told her i believed her and asked her if she recognized the voice and asked her if maybe she was thinking the words so much that she kept thinking them and couldn't get them out of her head... and she said, no mommy....    it's like the voice is in my head    i told he to let me know if she hears the voices again.she will be 5 in july.    should i take her somewhere?    i mean, do i ask her every day if she heard any voices in her head today?    do i ignore it until she brings it up again? what is normal?
3823,we ended up pulling our dd from her school instead of fighting it out for 8 weeks. we felt that someone had to end the drama so it might as well be us. my mom said that they probably have to say they are willing to accept special needs children so that they will not lose their federal funding; even if they are not actually equipped to deal with all types of children. we have lots of exciting plans for her after we move. i've already spoken to a couple potential schools and found one that we think would suit her really well. i can only work in the evenings now when my dh is home. i don't get to see him as much as i'd like, but it's not permanent.
3824,hi i wnated to know if its normal that my child didnt decide wich hand to write with left or right he is almost 5 years he is finding probles in school because of that ?
3825,chinese diet tip could keep breast cancer from mushroomingthe results of this new study about possible breast cancer preventative could grow on you like a fungus. apparently, women who eat just a third of an ounce of fresh mushrooms every day could decrease their chances of developing breast cancer by a whopping 64 percent!even though this study comes from china    and you know how i feel about things from china    i'm inclined to be encouraged. after all, before china became known for its deadly imports, substandard pharmaceutical ingredients, toothpaste and milk products, it was also one of the birthplaces of natural cures.in fact, this study found that the daily dose of mushrooms combined with regular consumption of green tea yielded a risk decrease of    hold on to your button caps    90 percent!obviously, there must be something in the chinese diet that's working right, because breast cancer rates in that country are significantly lower than in countries in the west    by as much as five times.dr.d.

3829,i have a 5.8 year old who we have been taking to a therapist for behavior management.he was born at 32 weeks has had late developmental milestones..severe speech delay, walking, feeding etc.. he has done very well with early intervention and specialized pre school however around 4 behavior became severe,,outbursts and defiance.. he is dx adhd and odd and i have put off meds for as long as possible.. he is extremely bossy, whines and basically has meltdowns all the time if he does not get his way.. he will not listen most of the time.. his tantrums get worse and worse.. we tried focalin xr 5mg and we saw basically no results.. the psychiatrist now suggested risperdal .2 mg(very low) 2x per day..i read everything i can find on the drug.the dr. says it is now being used for mood disorders.. he is calling it mood dysfunction or something.. he is not bipolar,..he just seems to go from zero to meltdown over any little thing.. it gets exhausting and i see how this is effecting everyone in his life.. i see how people don't want to be around him because it gets too tense with all the meltdowns.. i am worried about the risperdal.. is this a good tx.?? he has only been on for about 9 days.. and i do see some improvement.. i am just worried we are using a med that is really for other illnesses... will this target the fact that my son has no self control and is impulsive in actions and words??
3830,my son was born @ 29 weeks,he is now 2,5 he was diagnose with evolving motor disorder and increase tone in lower limps, he cant walk by him self need to hold some body's hand or something. we train with him really hard and for the last few months he really improve (also he wheres splints).the professionals    say that he will always have the problem and never be able to walk properly(even he is doing better and better ???)my question is if anybody have the same issue and if the diagnose they give as is correct? we don't give up- to believe he will be just fine.
3831,i am 56 yrs old and had a total hysterctomy today.    i have been through menapause, but never took anything.    just put up with the hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia etc.    my skin is not so dry, but i am very dry vaginally and after many years of enjoying sex, i no longer desire it at all.    haven't for about 4 yrs. which doesn't make for a very happy 43 yr old boyfriend i have been living wih for 7 yrs.    he is very tolerant and i do what i can.i have never thought about hormone replacement and have no knowledge about it at all.    my doctor is going to talk to me about it next week when i go for my post op appt.i have read several of the posts on this site, but it seems that all of the ones i read were much younger than i, and had not gone through menapause 1st.i had started bleeding again, was told by one doctor it was benign fibroids that needed to be removed.    when i went to another doctor recommended by a friend, whom i had accompanied her to the doctor on a couple of occassions and really took a liking to her.    she examined me and found a polyp at the mouth of my cervix, turned out to be pre cancerous.    also the lining of my uturus was much thicker than it should be for my age.i opted for the ovaries to be removed also, since ovarian cancer is one of the worse and because of my age.i would like some info before i see her again, info about someone who had already gone through menapause.    i have heard you can go through it again.    don't know if that is true or not.any help and info will be greatly appreciated,    debi
3832,my grandaughter is 4 and very smart.    it seems that she can be sweet part of the time and then can just fly off the handle.    my son and his wife have tried different types of discipline, but are at their wits end.    she seems to direct her crying and hitting more at her mom who has become depressed over the situation.    and she knows that she has been bad.    i have noticed when asked for hugs and kisses when we say good bye that she very seldom gives us one and it is not just us.    she has a 4 year old cousin who is small for his age and she can play nice with him, but at times will act more like a mother to him.    this has been going on for about the past year.    any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

3835,my son is 4.5 years old. he has been potty trained for one year doing #1. however, for some reason he cannot seem to do #2. he doesn't understand the concept of pushing the poop out and i simply do not know how to explain it to him. he does go, but since he doesn't know how to push it out, the only time he goes is when he is so overfilled that he has no choice but to let it out and then, he tries to hold it in. i am totally at a loss on what to do.    he has been sitting on the potty today for almost 8 hours trying to poop and i keep thinking that this can't be right. but i don't know what to do, when i take him off the potty and try to wipe him up, i can see the poop still coming out so i put him back on the potty to finish and it is now a recurrent cycle. ever since i can remember he has had problems with constipation. i give him baby laxatives and raisins to loosen up his stools but they don't seem to do much good. he has to start kindergarten soon and i am afraid he will be that one child who goes to kindergarten in diapers.    he has already been expelled from pre-kindergarten.    what do i do or say to this child to get him to understand how to push the poop out?    he is my third child, so i have done the potty training thing before but for some reason he just does not want to do it. i have talked to my doctor and their response is he's just not ready. i find that hard to believe because he says that he wants to go on the potty but then after a few days in underwear and his first accident, he gets discouraged and reverts back to pull ups.    could this be a medical problem?
3836,hello....please help....today is day 75 clean and sober.    previously i was sober for 2 years.    my life is in the sh...t hole right now.    my bank account is negative...i have no job...the car needs gas....my son needs lunch money...and what am i doin?    i am thinking i can drink just one beer and be ok.    would just make me relax.    i have even already counted my change.    i have to go pick my husband at work in 1 hour and could just stop at the local gas station.    why is it that we alcoholics believe we can casually drink and not go back to our ways.    please help me not take drink!

3838,my 6 year old son is a normal healthy boy.he is quite friendly and very loyal in his friendships.problem is that he quite often feels that children doesn't like him and don't want to be friends with him although i don't seem to analyse any reason for it.he likes to be friends with more outgoing and sporty boys but when he befriends them he tends to become a follower doing just as they instruct and it does occur to me that he is lacking leadership qualities.sometimes,he may be more capable but he takes a backseat with his domintaing friends just so that they still remain friends with him.a boy whom he considers his best friend and really likes is very dominating and makes him follow him.when they 2 are alone he'll be playing with him but as soon as a third boy comes along he ignores my son and starts playing with him.i realize my son feels deeply hurt by his attitude.if my son tries to make new friend that best friend of him doesn't let him do that.it seems my son is besotted by him that he is not ready to listen anthing against him and it truly breaks our heart to see that boy hurting my son every time.he doesn't say anything to us but sometimes i find him sitting alone depressed.what should we do?? please help

3841,i am having a difficult time with my 7-year old.    he is in 2nd grade and has been in 2 different schools.    the one that he attended as a kindergartner closed at the end of that year.    we chose to go to another small school similar to what he was used to.    we fought every morning for him to go into the school.    i would have to drag him kicking and crying into the school to his classroom and if i didn't sit with him for a little while, he would get extremely upset.    the teacher would literally have to pull him off of me so that i could leave.    as soon as i was gone, he was fine.    we dealt with all of that to come to a student/teacher conflict.    being in a new school system, we weren't aware of all the little things that make school life work.    this teacher, as we found out, wasn't the best at making life in the classroom easy.    anyway...2nd grade started out great and he doesn't have a problem after the first day when the teacher politely informed him that it was his job to get out of the car and come into class without his mom and that i shouldn't have to walk him in.    he would be just fine and has been.    she is a fantastic teacher.ok with all of that...here is the problem.he struggled a lot with doing homework and reading last year.    to the tune of being about 3 months behind in his reading series.    this year he has a terrible time concentrating on his work and it is still very hard to make him do his homework at night.    he is so stubborn that it is like talking to a wall.    it doesn't work to yell at him as he just shuts down when that happens.    i sit with him every night and what should only take him 15 minutes to do usually takes 30.    the teacher has talked to me about holding him back as he is the youngest in his class and at least one of the students (there are only 14 in the class) is about 15 months older than he is.    he has a horrible time staying focused.    he knows how to do the work and when he is worked with one on one...he can read to the specs of an accelerated reader.    he can do his other work when he decides that he wants to do it.    he has been tested for special education and actually did some of the tests in half the time alloted.    his results soared.the teacher has discussed her thoughts on this and when i express my concern for holding him back she says that he has the potential to be a leader and knows the stuff.    he just doesn't understand how to process all of that information in his head all the time.    she has worked many years with the 3rd grade teacher and neither of these teacher feel that he is ready to go into the 3rd grade.    the 3rd grade and the 5th grade are both the hardest grades.    just so much transition.    he uses big words and uses them correctly.    he has great problem-solving skills.    most of the time i figure it is stubbornness that is causing this problem, but i can't use that as an excuse for when he doesn't do his homework.i know that i am the parent and that he should be doing what i say, but when it is a daily argument to do homework, you can only fight for so long before you are ready to give up yourself.i have until the end of march to decide what i want to do.    his father won't even discuss the needs of our son.i honestly don't know what to do.    if we hold him back then we take a chance on breaking down his self-esteem and causing confidence problems.    if we don't hold him back then we are going to have study problems forever.    there are many times when i can't sit down with him at night, if i don't do it, he doesn't get it done.    just doesn't seem to be a priority for his dad.    they don't want to fight with him as he just shuts down.i am looking for suggestions and thoughts...just need to make as accurate a decision as possible.thanks,
3842,i need help my 8 yr old daughter has never wrote at school, i have had specialist and counsellors for her who all say she is fine, because she writes in front of them like any normal child.nothing has even happened at the school, she has been like it since she started, can anyone help me please.
3843,my 7 year old stepson    keeps pooping pants for the last 5 days this has been going on. he is with his mother, and doesn't eat healthy, we keep asking why he does this and we get they answer, i dont know.    we don't know what to do , and maybe hope to get some answers here.
3844,i have two children from a different marriage and i share custody with my husbands mom. she never follows the court order that is in place. i have filed contempt charges on her. every time i call my children my 10 year old daughter will not talk to me. she calls me a horrible mother and other ridiculous things. every time i go to see my children she will either not be there or tell me i should call before i come and will not let me take them. is there such a thing as brain washing a child because my daughter is acting like she don't even know lately like she could care less if i was even in her life.
3845,my 5 year old son just started kindergarden this year and is very smart but, seems to keep getting notes home or calls from the teacher about how he hits someone or throws rocks at recess and then lies about it blameing someone else. i have tried everything from rewarding him for the good behavior with trips to chucky cheese or a new toy. i always make a big deal of it when he gets all good marks for the day but nothing is working. he continues to do these things. he gets grounded from doing fun things like playing outside with the neighbor boys or going fun places or the tv. at home he yells at me everytime he does not get his way and crys about everything unless it is what he wants. i have been trying to get him to talk to me about the way he is feeling by using words instead of throwing the fits. any ideas on what i can do to get him to change the way he is acting?
3846,i had the surgery back in mid november 2009. since that date with some complications i have lost 70 pounds. i was in hopes to have lost more by now but am still happy with the results. i have 40 more pounds to go and i have hit a wall. i exersize and follow a healthy diet but my weight wont budge. has anyone experienced this and do you have any tips to start the weightloss process again?thank you!

3848,last year, he ended up in hospital because his bowel was so compacted with poop.    they found nothing wrong once he was cleaned out.    i watch him like a hawk.    he refused to go and holds it for 1-2 weeks until his stomach hurts. i even give him stool softener daily and fiber daily and still i can't get him to go daily.    his excuse is he is too busy.    what can i do?    could this be an emotional problem?    i am at my last straw.    i'm ready to do laxatives or enemas daily.    please help!!!!
3849,my 5 year old just recently started undressing his friends. he had a play date with a 4 year old girl and while they were playing in her playroom he undressed her. when i found out (walked in on them) i was shocked, but then took him home and talked to him about other people's privacy. we had talked before about his privacy, so i explained that just like we don't want other people looking at or touching his naked body he needed to follow the same rules for other people. he said he understood and i thought that was a lesson learned... until today. we were having another play date (with a different child, a boy this time) and my son was trying to coax him into taking his shirt off. the little boy came and asked him mom if it was okay cause my son said it was; she said no and the little boy ran back into the bedroom... knowing what had happened before i decided to go check on them and sure enough when i got to the doorway my son was still trying to convince him to do this. i called him into the bathroom and i reminded him what we had talked about before and then he got really mad at me and defensive. when we came out of the bathroom the other boy was upset and wanted to go home. i know it made the little boy uncomfortable, and frankly it makes me uncomfortable, but how do i make my son see that this is not an appropriate behavior?
3850,my four year old daughter has very recently (within the past few days) begun sobbing hysterically about how she hates our current house because it contains sharp knives and sharp scissors.    she asks me incessantly (i.e., every five minutes or so) when we can move out of the house and go to live at the lake.    she insists we will need to take everything from the current house except the bathtubs and toilets, because we will use the lake both as a toilet and a bathtub.she has begun to refuse to use the bathroom, going so far as wetting herself when she could no longer hold it in and pooping in her pants.    she claims that she is scared because the toilet might over flow if she uses too much toilet paper and has compromised by putting the paper in the trash can and refusing to flush.    she will additionally concede to using her old baby potty.she recently revised her lake/house issue by saying we need to build a new house with new toilets.    she asks me, every five minutes why we have not left to build the new house.    when i explain we cannot afford to, it is too late, we need to talk to other people to get help with building, etc., she breaks down and begins sobbing.    i have attempted to distract her with the possibility of building a house out of blocks (too breakable, she says) or drawing the house she imagines.    the drawing idea was useful, but she returned quickly to the demand that we must go start to build the new house.    even the act of drawing made her suddenly break down and start sobbing when i asked her what one particular squiggle was.    she explained later that it was a sign for katy's house and pointed to another sign on the other side that said katy's restaurant.i am puzzled by all of this.    her sister has just recently finished second grade.    my four year old will go to pre-school in the fall (which delights her).    she is strong-willed and often pouts when she does not get her way, but the incoherent sobbing about a house seemed uncharacteristic.her father and i are in the middle of a divorce.    i suspect that is part of it, but i don't know how or why (never took child psychology).    he has a female friend that the girls spend a great deal of time with (in fact, they spend more time doing things with him and his female friend than they do with him and me, though i do my best to spend as much time with them on the weekends and in the evenings as i can manage).the best i can come up with is that perhaps this is her brain's way of coping with what is clearly a broken family.    maybe she imagines that, if she can build a new house and fix the things that are wrong, she will be able to fix her family too.if you have any ideas, please help.
3851,i have been with my husband for 23 years, and he's always drank too much. there for awhile so was i but i grew out of that, partying all the time.. but he still does it all of the time. now he is laid off and doesnt have anything better to do with his time but drink with his brother or whoever is around to drink that day. i am so sick of it. i have left numerous times, and hes ok for a little bit but then goes right back to it. he says he knows there is a problem but he wont do anything about it. he keeps saying he'll stop, and never does. i've hear that thousands of times now. my mom and dad are going crazy over this. they hate that i put up with it. i love him but i just don't know how much longer and can keep our family together. we have an 18 year old daughter. she knows how he is and says to me all the time, what are you doing with him? everyboday tells me to get out while i still can. i'm not getting any younger.what should i do? please help me.

3853,my son has ms/ccsvi. he had ccsvi treatment and was doing really well. unfortunately he was mistakenly taken off clonazepam over 3 weeks instead of 8 or 9 months!! he therefore had a grand mal seizure and 6 smaller ones with an hour. this happened 1 week after stopping the clonazepam. his short term memory is gone!! he is confused constantly. he asks how old he is (39) and what year it is. he repeats many questions several times an hour. he thinks everything is new, his furniture and my car and all the roads and buildings. can anyone tell me if this is going to last forever or for how long? it's been 2 1/2 months since the seizure. w are shattered by this. thank you.
3854,on my stomache i have a circle type thing that is above my belly button and it is red and itches also it is dry....... what is this called?
3855,i'm a stepmom to a child who is almost 10 years old.    my husband and i have been together for 8 years and married for 7.    i have known this boy since he was 2 years old.    we found out through a dna test nearly 2 years ago that the child is not my husbands biological child.    my husband and i have two children together.    the biological mother has no other children.our situation is unique and i don't know anyone else to turn to.    quick history: after a nearly 3 year bitter custody battle, his mother won primary custody and we have visitations.    my husband has been there since day 1 and even after the dna test, has continuted to be there.    it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the visits because bio mom always complicates things.    also, with him being the 'only child', he is spoiled rotten at his primary home and i get the feeling he expects a lot more from us (material wise) then he is getting.bio mom & my husband were never married.    she is on her second long term relationship since thier split and she is currently engaged.    the new boyfriend gives undivded attention to the child and they seem to have a good relationship (more friends than parent figure).    they are, by all means, a 'fake little family'.the biological father is out there and the bio mom has pretty much refused to contact him. she feels that she should be able to pick and choose who is in her childs life.    i believe that since she chose to sleep with him, at one point she must have thought he was ok!we are stuck.    we don't know what to do.    does this child continue on thinking we are his family, his flesh and blood--only to have this taken away from us on some whim by the unstable bio mom?    do we tell him, at 10 years old that we love him and will be there for him but that he has another dad?    we have a custody order in place from the courts, but this will all change soon.    the bio mom is going to have it withdrawn to reflect the current cirumstances.any advice would be appreciated!!
3856,i have a four year old grandaughter that knows it is wrong to act out and will go along good for a short while and then all of a sudden she will tear up a room. she has been kicked out of two daycares and the public school say they do not have a program for her because she tested well on her screening and they cannot do anthing until she is in kindergarden which is the next school term. we just do not know what to do. you say to her what are the rules and she will tell you no fighting no biting no kicking no screaming    and she will say that is a bad thing to do. drop her off at day care within the hour they are saying come back and pick her up. i know they are just doing their jobs but what are we supposed to. she is in couseling which oes not seem to be working because when she acts up she will say can i go back to see the lady and she is refering to the counselor. please help

3858,my 4 year old boy has had this behavior for over a year now, and while it my hope was that it was transient, as the behavior seemed to wane over time, over the last week or so it has come back with a vengeance. at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, he will find a piece of food that to him looks like something, for example a tortilla chip that may coincidentally have the silhouette of an animal. he will then demand to keep it, and will then stow it away somewhere where it will invariably be forgotten. normally i would find this sort of thing cute and imaginative, however recently it has been nonstop, to the point that he will not eat as much as he should. he will simply 'see' something he thinks is cute in his food and refuse to eat it.any intervention, such as taking the piece of food away will result in an epic tantrum. if this were something we observed once in a while, we would likely think nothing of it. but it happens over and over and over throughout the day, to the point where we question the possibility of an obsessive disorder.as it happens, the onset of this more recent bout of tantrums coincided roughly with us taking him off zyrtec, an allergy medication, as i read that it could cause issues with kids. he had been on it for months and months, every night, at the instruction of his allergist. he would still be taking it if i hadnt done a bit of research about its possible negative pediatric side effects. it also coincided with his return to school, after winter break. before break started however, he had his hand broken by another kid at school, and had a cast, hand therapy, etc... the resultant drama at school was a bit much. if our child has obsessive issues coming from anxiety, then im sure all of this going on at his school didnt help.we did have him evaluated over a year ago because of some attention issues at school, and ruled out things like autism or asperger's at that time. their conclusion was that he has sensory issues, and as a result we had him in occupational therapy, which i am still somewhat confused about.anyway, while this post doesnt really paint the whole picture, my hope is that someone out there recognizes might have some insight. does any of this sound normal? i think the best case scenario would be that he is a spirited child, has eccentricities, will grow up just fine, and we're worrying way too much about it. that is my hunch, but just observing how little energy my wife has at the end of the day, i am concerned that there is something wrong. anyone?

3872,hello - i posted this question on the nutrition forum, but since this is a group all about mg, i figured i'd ask here too.    i've been taking mg citrate for a week now to try and reduce my premature ventricular contractions (pvcs).    i take a 200 mg tablet in the morning and 1 tsp of natural calm at night.    i noticed right after i took my first dosage the first day that within a few hours of taking the mg, i started to feel a weird internal-shaking feeling, almost like my insides were vibrating.    this has continued every day.    i only don't feel like this when i first wake up in the morning.    i know that mg plays a big role in muscles, so is it possible that my body is just getting used to the mg supplementation?    should i continue to take it and see if the shakiness subsides?    thank you!!
3873,earlier today i got my flu shot from the army national guard. tonight i noticed that when press into my shoulder at the location of the shot i can hear and feel a crinkling that moves around under my skin. it's almost as if there is air trapped between my muscle and skin and i can move it around.what in the heck is going on here?
3874,i am going to alanon tonight for the first time in hopes that i can clear my mind, that i am in fact not going crazy.i have been enabling my husband for 4 years now.    it wasn't until the past year that i have come to terms that my depression is related to watching him numb himself every night with 2 bottles of wine or equivalent of beer, and not being strong enough to tell him to stop. why? because when i do, he turns into a battle about every topic under the sun...then he takes off in the car and threatens to look for a place to live.last night i asked him why we have become so isolated from our friends and why our relationship is turning into roommates and not romantic partners, he shifts the blame on me. telling me i haven't lost the baby fat after my pregnancy 2 years ago.    i am 115 pound 5'6 and my friends (the ones i still manage to keep) think if i get any skinnier i will be anorexic.but i made a promise to him that if i run every day, i want him to stop drinking. he agreed for the most part minus weekends.he was doing ok the past few weeks, i would say a total of 5 days off and on without drinking. however, the other night he was vomiting perfusely for hours. i told him it might be withdrawals and he shrugged it off as if i was crazy.last night was the last straw.    i have relatives coming into town, so i needed to take a day off from running, but i was still over exerting myself cleaning and painting while he watched. then he popped the bottle of wine and this feeling of betrayal came all over me. when i questioned why he was drinking, he said it was because i wasn't running. there i was working my a*%^ off and he went outside to smoke and drink.i feel i have done way more than my share in this marriage..- financially supportive..since i make a considerable amount more than him- responsible to pick up and drop off our baby - which makes my commute an hour long.- not to mention the daily tasks when i get home to clean, cook, and run the dog (that he wants nothing to do with).but, now i need me to be under 100 pounds for him to even notice me.why would he give up what i think is an amazing life for alcohol.     i always support him in all his other endeavors. he loved me for that at one time..now he just criticizes me if i don't agree with him.i told him i was going to alanon and his words were whatever.    i told him that i am tired of being angry and i am taking reposiblity for the mess i have put myself in, which is why i need alanon.i don't think he will respond...but i know he will start looking for a place. that is is defense...should i always be in fear of him leaving????    should i just let him drink and turn my eyes? he's fine unless i bother him about his drinking.

3877,hello, i have a question regarding hernias and the options available on behalf of my grandfather. he's been a huge part of my life and growing up (for my short 19 years) and after the loss of my grandmother due to what our family has come to as malpractice, i vowed never to let a family member or loved one go under the knife for any sort of procedure or operation without at least an ounce of understanding of what's happening. i don't mean to come off offensively to anyone in particular, i am only asking these questions (and follow-up questions for clarity) for the sake of my grandfather and deciding what the best recourse of action is.currently my grandfather who is nearing 100 years of age has a hernia near his groin and has made 2 trips to the emergency room to massage it back in. he says that he ails in pain when the hernia pops out and is nearly immobile. apparently after having a long talk with my father, he has had this problem for about a year and has been pushing it off to see what it leads to. (regular check-ups with doctors and all that) well now that the hernia has popped out 2 times in the course of 2 weeks, the family as a whole is weighing the options and it is tipping in favor of the operation now as a last resort.so here are the questions that are on my mind. (go figure, it's 3:27am and i have an examination at 8am)1) what are the risks involved in operating?2) what options are there for operating? i read of camera-guided needles to opening a 4 section to treat the hernia.3) what added risks or complications are there considering his age?4) what post-op risks are there5) what are steps to help with recovery?6) are there any precautions to take prior to the procedure/operation? if so, what shall i ask of the doctor?thank you for reading and i truly appreciate any insight or help you can provide.
3878,i had a abdominal hysterctomy in november 2007 that left me with one ovary, since that time, i have severe mood swings every 28-30 days.    they are becoming increasingly worse each month.    i cry for no reason, accuse those around me of doing things i know (on a normal day) that they would never do.    i scream one minute, and sob uncontrollable the next.    i was recently forced to change doctors due to a change of insurance, this new physician states that one ovary is more than sufficient.    he checked my hormones during normal times, but refuses to check them during the rough days.    please help me, i feel like i'm driving myself crazy and driving away those i love.thanks
3879,i have a    4 year old little boy who is very smart and has a good imagination. however, he typically throws a tantrum in a store, dr. office, home, etc. he has problems with listening to me about picking up toys, manners, and not hitting and yelling. he will help with cleaning house chores except picking up his own toys. if i tell him to go to time out he will laugh and take off running. he also hits on me when he thinks    he is in the right. no matter what dicipline action i take he never listens. when i tell him to not do something or to stop hitting on me or being destructive of other peoples stuff he laughs and keeps on doing it. i try time out holding him and keeping him there from 4 to 10 minutes and he just goes back to the same think right after time out. i have also tried spanking and it does not work either. he will be starting pre-k in the fall and i am scared they will kick him out do to his behavior. it is to the point that no one wants to babysit for me and it is hard to try to work a full time job and beg people to babysit. what can i do to get him in control? some people tell me it is just a toddler for you it will get better the older he gets. but i am afraid that with the hitting and temper it could only get worse. should i speak to his pediatrician about the behavior or try something else. anyone with any advise please help i am ready to pull my hair out.
3880,best thing to do at early stages i will keep her warm love her but need some advice on the best i can do thanks
3881,my child is active at home he plays, sing songs    play with blocks talk    answers what ever we ask except of writing. he is very naughty at home. he is not interested in writing.when he enters the school he becomes calm,quite and dull. not at all active in the class. if the teacher ask him to write he just write a stroke and liedown on the bench. will not shout loudly or talk to the teacher. will not mingle with other children just sit quitely in the class. very worried about his behaviour in school. when he was 2 years old i joined him in school. but since he was not active in the school since then. i felt he might require more attention i shifted to another school which has less strength(only 6 children)    in his class. but still there is no improvement. he is the same.pls suggest how i can improve him.

3889,could someone please tell me what i need to do i have a little girl that will be 4 in december.    she has a behavioral problem.    she has been like this since she was able to walk and talk.    for examples: when she was little she would pull the kitchen chair up to the table and get whatever she wanted out of the cabinet no matter how high up it is she would figure out how to do it then we hit the terrible 2 stage and that is what we thought it was so we just diplined her having timeouts and all .    but it gets worse i cant take her in public nowhere she shows her butt to i dont want to be seen with her .    i follow thur with the punishment that i tell her she is going to get.    and it does not get any better.    a couple more examples of things she does is that she has spray painted my truck i take her to other places and she some how finds things that she knows that she is not suppose to have and gets them and hides it ans runs with it.    she has took permanent marker and marked all over the walls.    she took a pair of scissors the other day when i told her to go for a nap and i went and tucked her in and she cut my spread bc she didnt want to take a nap and today she ripped up a box that i was suppose to have shipped out today and the people could not take it bc she ripped up the sticker. and when you ask her if she has done it she lies and lies and lies when you know she did it.    what can i do i have put her in time out i have took things away from her i have spanked her i have not let her go anywhere i have done it all and i just dont know what else to do seems like when i punish her it gets worse and worse instead of better

3893,i am at the end of my rope... our five year old son is a very bright and inquisitive child and generally very well behaved at home and in public but school has become a very different story.    he's currently in a pre-school/daycare program and will be starting a formal kindergarten program in two weeks.    for the last three weeks he's been having terrible tantrums at school, tearing books, spitting in other kid's meals, telling the teachers he gets beat at home and his parents don't care about him, etc.        my husband works out of state and is home only on weekends so i'm sure that this situation, combined with the impending new school situation has him nervous.    we've talked with him, coached him in strategies to constructively express anger, taken away privileges when he misbehaves, given him rewards when he acts appropriately... i don't know what else i can do.     he generally sleeps 10-11 hours per night, eats a well balanced diet and is given a lot of affection from both parents.    he's such a good child at home.    we are firm parents with good boundaries and clear expectations and tantrums like the ones that occur at school almost never happen at home.    i'm frightened that this will continue when he goes to real school and he will get labeled a troublemaker or bad kid.help?-erin
3894,i was just found to have low levels of vitamin d for the third time in the last year and a half.    i've been having various symptoms during that time, including joint pain, eyes that are sensitive to light and generally a little poorer vision than before, and heartburn or acid reflux (though that symptom has improved a lot).    i received numerous tests for those symptoms, and the vitamin d deficiency was the only thing that the tests found.    the previous two times i tested low for vitamin d, my doctor had me take 50,000 units once a week, for 8 weeks the first time and 12 weeks the second time.    i never noticed any improvement in my symptoms after taking the vitamin d, though my vitamin d level improved to a normal level.    i take a multivitamin daily which contains vitamin d, and also drink orange juice fortified with vitamin d and calcium, but that hasn't seemed to prevent my vitamin d level from becoming low again after i stop taking the high doses of vitamin d.i was wondering if i should be taking a relatively high level of vitamin d all the time, rather than just for a couple months at a time.    is it normal to have low levels of vitamin d even when you are getting some from a multivitamin and fortified juice, or might that indicate i'm not absorbing it well?    also, since i never saw any improvement with my symptoms after taking high doses of vitamin d, could that be because my vitamin d level wasn't in the normal range for a long enough time for my symptoms to improve, or might that mean that the vitamin d deficiency isn't the actual cause of the symptoms?    could the vitamin d deficiency itself be a symptom of whatever is causing the other symptoms, or is it more likely that it is the root cause of the problem?
3895,on december 5th, 2006, i sustained a nasty laceration to my forearm after falling on a glass which subsequently took a gouch out my arm which left me with a hanging skin flap. on attending the a&e dept, they inserted 7 stitches, however i then got an infection so the stitches had to come out, i attended the hospital on a daily basis to get dressings changed as laceration was very deep. thereafter attented my local practise nurse for a further 4 weeks until wound had healed on the outside. i realise i am going to be left with a nasty scar, but my concerns are that the 'flap' of skin is still raised and not level with my arm, what i was wondering was will this ever reduce and eventually be level again.i would rather not be looking at cosmetic surgery !!look forward to hearing your advice.
3896,not a question but rather a comment. i had correction of bottoming out done on one of my breast implants 1 week ago and it looks amazing, the procedure was an absolute success. i just write this incase anyone else has had/has the same problem:)
3897,my 6 year old boy still walks on his tip toes he saw a pediatrician when he was 2 years old and all was o.k. when i ask him if it hurts when he walks properly which is very rare he say s no so i thought it was a habit. he has also had problems with choosing a dominant hand to write with although he does everything else with his left hand. the school has now got me worried saying that not having a dominant hand to write with and tip toeing can be connected and that i should get him checked out again is this true please help a worried mother.
3898,hi, i'm a 17 year old male. i'm about 5'11 165 lbs. i started puberty very late, with my first voicecracks around my 16th birthday. i now have pubic and underarm hair, a relatively average voice, and definitely have grown in the past year. here's where my question lies however: is my bone growth and facial features done changing? i have the smallest wrists out of any guy in my grade, however some of the longest hands (not necessacarily the hands withthe most girth), i have size 11 feet but relatively small ankles. i do not have nearly as much muscle mass as most of my friends, but i have been lifting for a year and have added a good 20 lbs of weight. also, everyone says facial wise, i'm one of the youngest looking, i'm a senior and people mistake me for a freshman or even younger. i think this has to do with a small bit of fat on my cheeks and a small jaw. will my face keep developing and will my jaw become bigger? i don't have much facial hair, i've never had to shave in my life. also my head is quite large compared to the size of my neck, which also is very small compared to my friends. why is it that i am of average weight and heigth compared to my friends yet all the features that are supposed to be accentuated in men are not up to par? any help is much appreciated, thank you!
3899,i am a 50 year old woman. i had a hysterectomy one year and nine months ago and i have had urinary problems developing progressively since then. i have to get up during the night, usually three times, sometimes only twice and i feel the need to urinate very frequently during the day, even though there isn't much to pass. i don't have a urinary tract infection as this has been checked.
3900,i had a laprascopic supra cervical hysterectomy with the ovaries being removed also.    it has been 11 days with no hot flashes.    when do they usually happen?
3901,hi,i had a complete hysterectomy in january and until recently have been showering.    i've started taking my baths and all of    sudden there is a slight irritation (i guess because of the soap), so i changed to a milder one...but now i have slight discharge...not smelly but nonetheless a discharge.    can i use medicated douche or should i just leave it alone?    p.s. the sexual activity with my partner of 8 years has been great!    we both waited wayyyy past the 8 week recovery period before getting intimate.. my partner is very supportive.    anyway, back to the question at hand...should i use medicated douche or leave it alone..

3904,my son is five, he has been potty trained since he was 2. we have never had any problems with bed wetting.    he has had a problem with constipation for atleast 3 yrs, we have been to the doctors several times about this, they always put him on a laxative and when he is on it regualary he is fine. when he is regular again i take him off it, now unless he is on the laxative he doesnt go, we recently went back to the doctor and they sent him for    an ultra sound on his bowels, but it came back fine. we have another apointment next week out of sheer frustration. three months ago my son started to urianate on the living room floor and a few times on the couch....now in the past 4 weeks he has taken a bowel movement on the floor twice, i should mention that i am six months pregnant as well, my doctor has mentioned that perhaps this is behavioral, im confused as to wether it is a behavior problem or a physical problem and i dont seem to be getting any answers from our family doctor as to how i deal with it ....i am getting seriously sick of cleaning the rugs not to mention the smell....i have diciplined him for doing it but i feel guilty because im not sure if it is a physical problem. please help me im concerned that it could a physical problem that is going undiagnosed....thank you

3907,my son taylor is 10. he is a very caring child but he has a hard time controling is temper.lately we do nothing but scream at each other. he loves drama and he has a tendency to make things a lot worth than they are. there is no more communication between us, and everything is subject to discussion or should i say fights.i need help finding a way to open so kind of dialogue and make him understand that we are the parents and that is our role to make sure that he gets the best education without arguing
3908,my 3 year old son is completely out of control. his father and i have been divorced for 2 years. his father has not seen him in over a month and the last time they saw each other, he was the witness to physcial abuse(from his father) to me.we have recently moved in with his grandparents..where of course he gets away with more. his behavior has seen to drasticaly change within the last few months. he attends daycare where they say that he is the typical 3 year old little boy. nothing major! when he stays with his grandparents alone, they will tell me he was angel. with me.. he does not listen, he hits me, he kicks and hits anything around, has a temper tantrum, and slaps and hits hisself in the face, pinches his self, pulls his hair. he yells at me slams doors, and throw things. i do dicipline him..i know i do let him get away with something he shouldnt but it doesnt seem that spanking with my hand or belt is helping and i have even tried just talking to him without spanking him. he knows when he does something wrong!    i know as being a single mother of a child who doesnt have a active father i feel a bit guilty when i continuously have to spank him or yell at him. i want him to grow up with good morals and values.which basically is the complete opposite of his father. i want him to respect me and others and have the manners that he should. what do i do. i am open to any suggestions!!
3909,my 3.6 yr old girl is bladder trained and refuses to poop in potty.    she wears underwear and poops in it and it doesn't bother her.    if we make her sit in the bathroom, she just cries and won't go.....helpthis discussion is related toalmost 4, withholding stool and refusing to poop in potty.
3910,i don't know if it is because i read too much, but my son seems to be exhibiting alot of the symptoms of a sociopath.    first of all, we have 2 dogs.    one is a medium size year old dog and the other is a small puppy.    the medium dog, he always pulls her tail and paws and steps on her paws or he tries to sit on her.    he does this just to hear her yelp.    that is what is so disturbing.    he hears her yelp and then he will mimick the sound and then try to hurt her again untill i physically pull him off of her.    he has now escalated to punching the poor dog, and the dog is getting closer to actually biting him.    i have tried to punish him every way possible, and nothing works.    i take away everything from him and he could care less.    its when i take all his things away and ground him that he does it even more because he has almost nothing to do.    and the poor puppy - he was gentle when we first got him, but now he pick him up by the head and throws him onto the floor and he always tries to make sure that the puppy does not land on its feet.my son is 4 years old.    i see that some of these things he is getting from the tv & playstation (at grandpa's), but he also has a temper that i cannot control.    my father is the only one that seems to be the one that can sometimes get him to calm down.    i brib him.    his father is not in the picture.but, my son can be very sweet at times, and he is very protective of me, and he is very much a mama's boy.    i also know that this altogether is so close to what a sociopath is thought to start out like as children, and i am left to wonder, is my child one, or am i just a really paranoid bad mother?
3911,iwe have a 7 year old daughter who exhibits an inability to sooth herself to sleep.    we have tried rewards - punishments.     it is almost like she just can  t let go of the day.    we have to be within her sight at bed or she has a fit.    we have gone from sitting on the bed to the floor to the door way to the hallway but just can't seem to get past this.    some nights this could take an hour or two.    we have done night lights.    she wears my watch to bed for comfort.    we are so frustrated in her inability to go to sleep.    what we find astonishing is she goes 110% all the time and just can  t seem to shut down or even slow down.    we have recently started a   daily journal   in an effort to recap the day so that we can   remember it.    this seemed to have helped but only slightly.    we do have a very structured routine in an efforts to slow the day down and bring it to a close.    that is bath at 7:30 bed and book by 8 and lights outs by 8:15.    if we can get    her to be still and quite for just 30 seconds  ..i mean it 30 seconds she out.    but getting that 30 seconds is sometimes the most trying time of the day.a little history i am divorced and she is a result of my first marriage.    she has been and continues to go to therapy weekly for this as well as anger management issues.    she has some abandonment issues we are attempting to work through.    i have recently   discovered   that when she was at her      real   dad  s (when we had shared custody) he would put her to bed and then go out locking the doors and not come back for hours.    i can  t even imagine how terrified she must have felt.    no matter how much we reassure her that we would never leave her that we will keep her safe, there is no end in sight.    she can wake up 2-3 times a night and once she hears or see  s us she goes right back to sleep.    problem is we are not so lucky      i would appreciate any advise/help that would allow her to go to sleep and us to get a full night  s sleep.we have made certain that when she is not with us she knows how to contact us no matter what and that she can call no matter what.    problem here is, we live in the country and her dad puts the phone up.    she insists on being with her dad, problem here is when he has her he never around she is always passed off to grandma or an aunt or uncle to tell the truth i feel better if she is with them at least then i know she is safe.     but we need to find out how to help her turn off the day and show her that it is ok to sleep.    please i am begging any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.betty

3916,my 6 yr old boy cries all the time.    it doesnt matter what the subject is, where we are, or how we try to handle the emotional outbreaks, he cries over, what seems like, anything.    im very concerned about his behavior because im not sure what the underlying problem is and how to handle it.    he is our middle child, so we thought that if we created more 1 on 1 time with him, it would help.    i have tried taking privledges, sending him to be by himself in another room, even trying to figure out whats bothering him.....nothing has worked.    when i ask him to talk about his feelings, he says  i dont know.    his behavior has made it to where it is very difficult to do things, anywhere from going out on family outings to bonding with him.    i love my son and want the best for him, but my failing efforts are frustrating! any advice?i should also mention that this behavior has been going on for close to 2 years now.this discussion is related tomy 6 year old cries all the time..
3917,what does it mean when a three year old has his head tilted to one side all of the time, he watches the television this way,talks and even listens in this manner. he was asked if his ear or anything hurt him and it took a few minutes for him to respond but he stated that no it did hurt. he has been doing this since he was born according to his mother.
3918,i have a 5 year old student (kindergarten) in my class who is very intelligent.    he can read at a 1st grade level and is overall very bright.    he has 1 mother and father (only ones he's every had) and no siblings.    he came to school and was completely unmanageable by two different teachers.    he was brought to me and i struggled terribly with him.    he was fine with me and would do acceptable work with me; however, as soon as any children came into the class he could not and would not work.    his behavior crashed everytime and he was eventually taken out of the class.    eventually i convinced mom to take him to the dr with my data (observations) and they put him on an adhd medicine.    three weeks passed and his behavior was greatly improved.    he never had to be removed from the class.    however, he still will not do any work.    he not only won't do work he's deliberately giving wrong answers to obvious questions he knows the answers to.    sarcastic responses.    if i removed all the students from the class he will begin working without a hitch and do excellent work.    if adults come into the room he will work fine regardless of how many, but if they are kids - he shuts down immediately.    what on earth is happening that a child can't function around othe kids only adults.    he's failing school because he does no work.    he's very sad all the time.    bright child, very smart.    loves knowing things functions well with adults.    flips switch and crashes when similar age students are with him.    can't funtion around his peers.    any help would be appreciated

3926,i have a 4 year old son. he has been to a psychologist, pshychiatrist and therepist. 2 different offices. psychologist was first. this one diagnosed my son with have add, adhd, odd, and ocd. he then referred us to a psychiatrist because of the severity of his case because his thought was he would need to be put on medication.we then saw the therepist for the initial evaluation. i expressed my concerns. agressiveness, easily aggrivated, complete disreguard for his belongings, not sleeping at night (by this i mean he went to bed at 8:30 and wouldn't fall asleep until midnight or after, and got up 3 times during the night, and woke up at 5:30).as for the disreguard for his toys, by this, i mean the punishment would be having toys taken away. after the second time in doing this, he would go and get a trash bag and hand it to me and tell me ok, throw it away. i don't care mommy - at tjis point he was three. he pulled all the clothes out of his dresser drawers, out of the closet, then, would take the bowl in his potty seat that we had put in his room for middle of the night potty issues, would pee or poop in it, then fling it around the room. and ripped the pages out of every book he had. and before someone says it, i did take the toys and books and even the clothing out of his room. this resulted in him using his fingernails and peeling off the paint on the walls. then at one point tore open his pillow and ripped apart his blankets.therepist decided we needed to see the doctor. she too said all of the things the psychologist did, with the addition of insomnia (which i too suffer severely from).saw the doctor. doctor gave us 4 medications to research in case we changed our minds on medicating our 3 year old. which, we did eventually change our minds on. he was put on ritalin. worked our way up to 25mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening. he was also put on, after we worked our way up, 1.5mg risperidone every evening at dinner time to help his behavioral issues at night and to help him sleep. which, i must admit, the risperidone did help him sleep. however, the ritalin, even though it did help with the out of control hyperactivity, also somehow caused him to space out in his preschool class. (put him in prek so he would have other children his age to play with and socialize with in hopes it would help).so. here it is. he has had all of his toys taken away, aside from books which i have him sit and read even if it is just making words up. he is now getting up 5-7 times a night, and has now resorted to sneaking food (by the way he has been off all medication for over 2 months now, so no its not the risperidone causing him to be hungry). he has become even more verbally aggressive with the addition of phsyically aggrissive which is now causing issues in school (he pushed a little boy in his class, then took a toy from another and hit him with it) and is becoming very physical with myself, my husband and my daughter (his almost 2 year old sister) as well. he knows he is to behave if he wants his toys back, but continues to disobey and spits when he is asked to do something. he now also cries, aaallllll the time. for nothing, and everything. he hits and kicks our 3 dogs and 3 cats (yes he has even been nipped at once or twice, which you would think would have had some impact, but continues to do this anyway --scares me more now that he has begun to do this with our 70lb, 11 month old german sheppherd--). he knows about santa and has been told he will be put on the naughty list. his response has been so? i don't care. you don't tell him what him what to do. he'll bring them anyway.so. no toys, he gets sent to his room, is made to do chores, sits in a time out chair, goes to bed early, has any other priviledge taken away if it is needed... and probably just about anything else you could think of. i cannot do this anymore. i am utterly exhausted, and have been pushed beyond my breaking point, broken and am almost to my shattering point. i have researched every other possible alternative and tried them all for endless weeks all of them failing. i am embarrassed to take him into public for the way he acts, and feel like a failure as a mother that i cannot find a way to control my four year old son.i am in desperate need of help. please. anybody.

3930,hi my question is that my 5 year old son has 2-3 bathroom accidents on a daily basis.    before he started pre-school he had accidents but not nearly as many as he does now.    he tends to hold until it is too late.    i will take him to the bathroom with him pouting and telling me i don't have to go.    yet, he will end up going.    i don't understand why he will say he doesn't have to go, when he really does.    i leave him extra changes of clothes at school so i am not driving back and forth.    when i ask him what happened...he laughs and changes the subject.    i don't scold him and just tell him i need him to be my big boy and go the restroom.    he does wet the bed at night as he is a heavy sleeper and we just don't make a big deal.    we praise him highly when he doesn't have any accidents.    please help me...i am loosing my patience.    what can i do to help my son?    i don't want this to affect self-esteem.mom

3936,i have a 5 year old little girl. she is a only child, but i have taken her to story time and had her in preschool. now that she started kindergarden a month ago, her behavior is off the charts. she is yelling out in class, misbehaving in line, cutting her clothing, lying about everything (huge lies with plots and organiztion, even consequences). she has always been a bright child and knows every thing they are currently teach, but the socail skills. she has been kicked out of class twice this week and the school has told me that she is scaring the other kids. she knows right from wrong, she says that she has funny wiggles in her and that is why she can't behave.this is a complete change from how she acted before the start of school. i talk to her, i give her positive reenforcement. the teacher and i are communicating everyday. i need help!! how can i show her a connection between good choices and good things (books, playground, shoping, playdates).
3937,my 8 year old son, has been stealing items from home and taking them to school,    (a special necklace and it gets broken),    he steals $20 and lies about taking it.    the teacher sends a note home and he rips it out from his planner.    this entire school year he has tried to get the teacher and i into arguments. (i don't understand why?)    my son is very intelligent, creative and knows right from wrong.    he makes wonderful grades and is on no medication (other than an asthma inhaler).    but for some reason he feels he needs to lie instead of telling the truth.    he continously tries to make other adults feel sorry for him.    i have tried everything and nothing is working.    i have tried time outs, taking away favorite toys, grounding him, suspending certain priviledges.    i have talked with him and tried to guide him the best i can.    but right now nothing is working.    does anyone have any suggestions?

3941,my daughter who has been staining her underwear with poop has been doing this since before she started kindergarten.    first i thought it was constipation so the dr put her on miralax and all that was doing was making her go in her pants more.    i took her to a gastro dr and she told me to put her on ex-lax everyday and that wasn't making her poop.    it takes her about 9 days to do an actual stool which sometimes is enormous.    we try taking things away from her and she says for how long and then goes to the bathroom and then poops after i take stuff away thinking ok i pooped now i can get my stuff back.    i don't know what else to do at this point.    it is going to be very embarrasing when she starts first grade and kids then will make fun of her.    this is so frustrating.    any help would be appreciated.
3942,i am 42 yr female who was in arelationship for 5yrs,when we met we both liked to entertain,party,and have a bottle of wine between us every night,as time went on my partner would increase the amount of alcohol he brought home from 1 bottle to 2, to 3 etc, i found myself drinking as much as he was although i could never handle it like him,he semed to keep it together,i would blank out/pass out etc,this went on for the first 2yrs of our relationship,there were so many arguments every night (which i always seemed to get the blame of next day,even though i knew he had thrown me out into the garden,into tables,thrown on the floor etc,trying to tell him this he just said i slipped and fell as i was soo drunk.we did throw him out numerous times but things he said would get better,so i'd let him back in,then i found out i was pregnant with my now 2 yr old son whom i luv very much,through my pregnancy i never touched a drop and for 6 mths after although my partner did by himself,but even more when he had a friend or 2 round. i did start to have a couple with him but again its gradually got more and more like before and the pushing ,shoving,verbal started again,and as usual its all my fault as i was too drunk,and fell on the floor etc, last week i ended up with a burst chin,he said i fell but i know i was pushed. i just think to myself why does he make out everything is all my doing,is it to take the spotlight off himself ?? i feel i gradually got in a rut and dependent on alcohol in this relationship,now i am on my own and havent touched a drophe however is still having a couple and is living elsewhere,he keeps sayin that we should get back together but i know it wouldnt work as it would all start all over again,just thinking did he keep toppin mine up all the time to take the spotlight of himself,or did i have sum kinda problem.
3943,my sister is in a persistent vegetative state a month and a half after a severe car accident. she is not responding to commands.    her normally waist length hair has been shaved, she has a trache (sp?), scar on her head and appears very frail.    her 4 year old daughter has not seen her yet. my sister always made a big deal out of seeing her daughter and now she won't even be able to recognize her or respond - is it a good idea or not?i think not, i think it will be traumatic for her daughter.    how can you possibly understand something like this at 4? am i wrong?
3944,okay at the end of kindergarten last year my son started having accidents and i was upset because his teacher was calling me all the time and told me something physiological was wrong with my son to be doing that and that he wouldn't be able to go to the 1st grade if it didn't stop. so i took him to the doctor they gave him mira lax and that helped at first then he got to the point it was diarrhea and so i stopped the mira lax and he would get constipated and i had to do suppositories and that was awful and still to this day he has little skid marks in his pants and sometimes not. he doesn't know when it is happening and over the christmas break we sat him on the toilet every 2 hours for 15 mins and it helped maybe a little skid mark here and there but when school started back up it started again its not a full blown poop just a little and i have a 1 year old and he shares a room with my six year old and i make sure everything he has soiled is always put up where he can't get to it but the other day my 6 year old apparently hid a pair of under wears and my 1 year old got it i was so angry i didn't know what to do. please help. i am lost he has never done this before.this discussion is related to6 year old defecates pants.

3947,in 1999, i got breast implants to go from a 32a to a 32d.    i have regretted getting them that big since day one.    i wish i'd gotten a small c cup and am considering getting them reduced.    i am wondering if the skin would be all saggy now and it would look bad if i got the reduction.    has anyone had a reduction and how did it turn out?    i know the skin is stretched considerably because i went so big.    the reason i don't like them is because i feel like nothing fits me very well.    i am a small person and when i wear a size small shirt it's too tight across the breasts (esp. button-up ones which gap and you can see my bra) and when i get size medium it looks like i'm wearing a sack even though it fits in the breast area.    i also hate people staring at them when i wear t-shirts and feel like saying hey, i'm up here!    my fashion choices are so limited now.    anyone relate?

3950,my 6 year old son recently started peeing his pants randomly throughout the day. i never catch him doing it until he is done and i find the wet clothes or notice he has changed in to a new outfit. the other day we were watching tv together and i dosed off to wake up to him standing by the closet peeing on the floor. his attitude has also changed drastically. he has become very mouthy and talks back to everything i ask him to do. at this point i have tried yelling, taking away tv and outside time with his friends but nothing seems to be working! i'm actually very concerned its beginning to stress me out and i have become extremely emotional. his father and i have been seperated for going on 2 years now and i have been seeing the same guy on and off for about that long as well until recently we made it official. his father has stopped coming around because of his own selfish reasons and i know it hurts him even though he just doesn't show it. i really don't know what to do please help.

3953,till what age is bottle feeding acceptable for my 2 n a half yr daughter. i give her bottle just once early in morning when she is in bed so as once she is awake i can sne dher to the kndergarten with something in her stomach. else she takes an hr to sip a mug of milk which is a routine each evening since last 3 mths.
3954,my daughter had her appendix out. they tried lap surgery and ended up performing the open surgery. she was in the hospital for 4 days throwing up and unable to eat the whole time but they released her. she was home less than 2 days when she stopped by my house and i noticed how red her surgical site was as well as swollen. i took her straight back to the er. they opened it partially and placed the packing in. she has been on heavy doses of iv antibiotics as well as daily packing changes for 7 days now. it is finally starting to look much better but she still has the nausea.    she has lost approx 20lbs in the 11 days.    just this morning the dr was talking about sending her home possibly with a iv in for antibiotics to continue as well as having a home health provider change the packing daily.    my concern is how can they even consider releasing her when she can't eat. the smell of food causes he to get sick.    how will she tolerate packing changes on only oral meds when she can keep anything in her stomach?is there anyone with experience with this abcess(abscess)/packing process?
3955,i have a 6yr old who hits his classmates and the older kids, he even hits his brothers with anything he has besides him. i am concerned, i try talking to him and even time outs but he does not care. he starts breathing hard and throws a tantrum that lasts for 15 minutes. the neighbors come outside to see what's going on i feel i can not take the pressure and stress. what can i do to help him change
3956,my son was adopted internationally at 14 months. at 15 months we had him evaluated (he only knew russian)and he met the requirements for early intervention for speech and after 6 months he joined a play group for 2 hrs. once a week. after 18 months of services with early intervention my son tested out of everything--they did the an extensive testing--speach--ot-pt -psyc,just about 4 months ago my husband and i signed my son up for pre-school so he would have interaction with other children his age. 2 weeks after being in the pre-school he was bitten by another child--well, now we are having issues with my son biting. he has bitten 3x since he first started with the program9since he recieved his first bite) and is now suspended for a day with the program. a month ago my son met with the sensory person(an outside consult recomended from the school) the outcome was that my son had some transition issues and it was recommended that the school have pictures for him to what he is going to be doing next--something my husband and i did with him at an early age do to the language gap so he could understand or communicate with us. i am not sure if the school has followed up on this but--the consult also mentioned that my son needs sensory stimulation--recogmendations were made for that. my son attempted to bite me once and was immediately put into timeout and his favorate toy was taken away--he has never attempted to bite--he attempted to hit once and i followed that same proceedure and he has never attempted it again. at home he has the normal 3 yr. old issues and they are immediately addressed. i can take my son anywhere and my friends are always commenting how good my son is. now i hear a completely different thing from school and i don't see any of the behaviors that the school is mentioning. his teacher are great at giving feedback which i like and i don't want my son to be thrown out of this school. tomorrow my son and i will be doing some role playing and working on how he can express his frustration --i am not sure how that will go but, since he has been suspended it will not be a fun filled day of play for him--i will remind him that he could be playing with toys at school--but. with not seeing this behavior i don't want to put all the blame on him because i don't know if all of the events leading up to the bite are all his fault--the bite definitely is--but at 3.5 years of age he is still working on developing how to express his frustration. any advice or suggestions will be very appreciated.thank you for your time!trigal
3957,hi my almost 5 year old daughter has recently been very sad, moody and clingy.    she is sad when she wakes up.    when i take her to school she is sad and most days starts to tear up when i leave and tell me that she wants me.    and she is sad when i pick her up from school.    her teachers have also told me that she is sad throughout the day and continually needs hugs.she never used to be like this.    she was happy when i took her to school and was in a good mood generally most of the time.    i am not sure if this is an attention seeking behaviour or if i generally need to be concerned.    sometimes i feel like i need to take her to coucilling to see what is really wrong with her.    my husband and i are getting very frustrated with her because it seems like no matter what she has or what we do with her she is mopey and sad.any suggestions for a frustrated and concerned mum?thanks,frustrated_mum
3958,i have an 18th month old daughter who has given me some concerns, and she has been late on some of her mile stones.    i have twin girls (fraternal) and they are very different, so it's hard not to compare.we are going to see a nuerologist (april 10th) for possible seizer disorder because she stares and zones out alot, and she has done this for a while, but within the last few months it seems worse to me and i'm taking action.    i wish i had taken a journal early on to really remember how she was at 9 months-12 months, but everyone was telling me she is fine, every child is different.she crawled at 11 months, and started really walking at 16 months.    she loves her books, i have read to both of my girls alot (and still do) since birth, and she especially likes to flip the pages (and early one, when aleah did not)    but seems to look at the pictures as well.    even though she turned pages early on, she didn't seem to have the grasping down at that time and only recently does she use her thumb and index finger (holding a stem of a flower, holding small puzzle pieces).she says da, da, ba, ba, ma, ma, but she doesn't say it to us to get our attention. she copies her sister alot, head shaking, banging a cup, clapping hands, but no words.    most the time she does not respond to her name being called, she would rather turn her head to a garbage truck coming down the street, or turn her head to an airplane way in the distance.if i say    we are going to have bath time, she knows and goes to the bathroom door.    she will be in the living room, and hear me say to her sister that i sippy cups ready, and she comes into the kitchen.    she started pointing at 16 months or so, and she is fascinated with airplanes, or anything that goes and started to point to the sky when she hears it, but no words.her dexterity and motor skills seemed to be delayed, and she is a very happy child, she smiles alot, and loves it when i hold her (i stay home with my twins) but not so much with her daddy and i figured because i'm home more.she doesn't really do her puzzles, and plays (bangs them together) with them more them put them together (the wooden ones). she does do (when her sister is not around) her circles with the holes and put them on the wooden sticks (small ones even, her dexterity has gotten better).my concern is that some of her symptoms were autism (of some sort), or some type of delay, only did our pediatrician recommend a neurologist to rule out seizer disorder.    i also thought to have her hearing checked (even though she can hear an airplane from a mile away) and then maybe a referral to the mind institute at ucd.i appreciate your attention to this issue, as it is very important for me to do everything and anything i can.    i have also (just for the hell of it) thought to do the no gluten no cassein diet.    maybe i will try whole foods and see if i can find a book to help me with constructing a cf/gf diet.kind regards,jennifer
3959,i'm a victim of severe hair loss, which i believe is related to hypothyroidism, so i started taking biotin. at first i only used 1000 mcg daily for a month, and the only difference i've noticed was the edges of my eyebrows were growing slightly. when i went to the store to buy more, the only dosage they had left was 10,000 mcg so i bought it. being a sufferer of hypothyroidism (even though i have not been diagnosed, i know i have it), is it safe to take? also, my mother would like to take them also and she takes high blood pressure and cholestorol meds daily.
3960,i am 72 years old....the skin is getting very difficult to pull over the head of my penus,,,it seems as though it it is shrinking so to speak....are there any remidies for this condition?
3961,i have a 10 y/o cerebral palsy,nonverbal,wheelchair bound girl who has an aide with her at school. several times she has come home with a very heavy urine filled diaper. i have addressed it with her teacher, but it doesn't seem to have any affect on the aide. i am very concerned with uti's and skin break down. as a parent do i have any say on requesting a new aide? i'm afraid if the school district doesn't like my suggestions, they will ask us to go else where.a concerned parent.
3962,my oldest daughter is 10yrs old.    she has always been a handful.    for years now, i have suspected that she may have adhd.    but everyone just kept telling me that she was just a hard headed independant girl.    over the last 1 1/2 -2 years, she has gradually been getting worse.    she dosn't listen to my husband or myself.    she wants to do what she wants to do and god help any one who tries to make her do otherwise.    but in the past 3 - 4 months, she has gotten completely out ofcontrol.    she is very, very mean and hateful to my youngest daughter who is 8yrs old.    she is constantly hitting on her, screaming at her and saying very cruel things to her.    almost every minute their around each other.    my youngest adores her sister and dosn't understand what she did to make her sister hate her.    i try to console her and tell her that its not her.    we can't get her to do anything we tell her to.    she has started treating people outside of the family the same now too. she has lost a lot of friends over it and has been banned from even going to certain peoples houses.    she dosn't show any consideration for anyone or anything else.    we have tried every punishment we can think of and have been advised to try.    nothing works.    in fact, lately, punishing her only intensifies her anger and outbursts.    it has carried over to her school work now, and even her teacher is having a very hard time getting her to do what she needs to do instead of what she wants to do.    i was researching odd and she shows signs of every one of the symptoms that was listed.    please help me.    i don't know if it is something that i am doing wrong or if it is for medical reasons.    my family has been through a lot over the last couple of years,    my husband and i had some problems for a while and it got pretty ugly.    but that was over a year ago and we have come a long way since then.if you can help me with some advise i'd greatly appreciate it.    thank you.
3963,i am so proud...you would think it was my son who came home with all his sticks in tact today!    oh my goodness!    he got out of daddy's car with a huge grin and a rocket ship toy as a reward!    this is the first time since school started, that my nephew kept every stick out of 5 all day long and i feel like i need to partayyyyyyyyyy!    (keep in mind, we had to beg the admin at school to say something positive about each day for a week now...they finally did!)let me elaborate just a bit...after my initial post...i got tougher.    then my nephew got sevier asthma attacks (dry, autumn weather, etc...), and had to use the nebulizer, inhaler, pred-zoner (my word, not the med's, lol)...and i realized he was feeding on the illness.    i (like i posted before) put my foot down with the copping out on the asthma and he came out of it with glory!    (knocking wood here, hehe).    he rocks!he's going to the demo-derby @ the fair for a big celebration tonight!    wooohooo!!!

3966,my six year old daughter constantly seems to want to argue and be miserable.    she is not happy unless she knows she is in control.    her father and i divorced recently (back in december) and we have only all been living seperatley since january.    this may be some of the problem part she has always been a very strong minded individual and likes to assert herself where ever possible.    unfortunately i am now becoming worn out with the constant battles.    the plus side and yes there is one - school have her completely focused and that is brilliant.    i know we cant have it perfect both at home and in the classroom but there has to be an easier way than living in a battle field.    she is a very bright child and i have to admit has a maturity which seems beyond her years when she sais certain things.please help!
3967,over the last 6 months i have losat weight and through the process have developed a skin rash and muscle weekness?    the same thing happen to me about 6 years ago when i lost weight.    any recommendations?
3968,my 5 year old son is very upset when his penis become erect. when asked if it hurts, he says no. when he is busy playing outside or watching a favorite cartoon, he doesn't display this behavior. sometimes, he does use this as a way to get attention from my husband and i. we've tried ignoring the behavior and trying to distract him, but it is troubling that he is so upset by it. unfortunately, he pulls on the penis and hits it to try to get the erection to go away, which makes the problem worse, of course. we've explained that this is supposed to happen and that it happens to all boys. he doesn't attend daycare and spends his time with his 4 1/2 year old brother and his stay-at-home dad, so we know that he hasn't observed this behavior in other kids. i am hoping for some advice about how to help my son become less concerned about this. thank you.
3969,i recently attended parent/teacher conferences for my 5 year old daughter.    her teacher told me that she is concerned about my daughter as she is not interested in playing with the other children.    i was told that during play time, she doesn't really engage herself in any particular activity, but seems to be in her own world.    when at home, she plays with her older and younger sister (she is the middle child), with her dad and i, and plays easily alone with her toys.    even though she initiates play at home, i now look back and remember times where i have picked her up from sunday school or another activity, and noticed her alone in the classroom instead of interacting with others.    when i asked her why she doesn't play with the toys or kids at school, she just says she doesn't want to and doesn't like any of the toys.    she is also very resistant to do activities that the others are doing, or is the last one to finish or finally participate!    i'm not sure what to think or do!    her teacher said that she seems like a typical middle child and that she needs purpose! i was crushed to hear this!    i spend time with all of my children and try to give them as much individual attention as i can, but obviously i'm lacking as a mom and feel like a failure!!!does anyone have any insight or advice on this?    how can i help my daughter??!!    thank you!
3970,my daughter was a healthy typical teenager who had all required vaccines throughout her life.    when gardasil was suggested by her new doctor, i, as a responsible parent, agreed.    she had just been given a clean bill of health for cheer leading, and then within 20 minutes she was extremely ill and has yet to recover, 1 1/2 years later.    her story is only one of hundreds of thousands globally.    i am not anti-vaccine!    i am just anti-gardasil and can't not warn others of the side effects that are written off as coincidental. truthaboutgardasil.org is a site to see stories of others as well as information with proof of the hidden adverse effects of this vaccine.
3971,i have a 7 yr. daughter, that i cannot seem to get through too.    i have asked her educators if she acts out in class and they have all replied no! the oly comlaint i get from her teachers is that she rushes her work, and does not take pride in her work.     but, at home she is a nightmare.    she will not listen, follow directions, lives in a pig sty in her room until i go in and empty it, will just become very excited and not focus on anything.    nothing matters to her, to use a positive reinforcement, negative can't even be considered ; it only gets worse.    she does not eat an excessive amout of sweets, maybe one small treat a day,every thing else is very well balanced. i would just love to find a way to make her hear me when she gets this way.    it is not every second, but some weeks it is more than others. is this add? is this just a little girl who likes to be very free spirited?    what does one do?

3975,so far, i have been to two cosmetic docs.    i never go to just one doctor.the first doctor i went to took my photos very close (2 feet away),    while the second doctor took my photos over 6 feet away!!!     what is up with that?i asked the second doctor why he was further away, and he looked at me crazed.    he said that's the first thing they learn in med school is to be about 6-7 feet away from patient.that's worries me a lot.
3976,my 6 year old step-daughter has been without her mother for the last couple of years, she just upped and left her to her father. i have been apart of her life for 4 years now and have been in a relationship with her father for 2. she was a very smart and independent child before being removed from the home by facs when she was 3 because of her mother. we have won our custody battle and she has been home with us for 9 months now. speaking with her foster mom i find that my boyfriend and i are having the same problems the foster mom was having with her.she is constantly mouthing off to everybody, she would rather play alone than with anybody else, she gets very physical with objects that are around her when she doesn't get her way. just last week she had a spelling test and she didn't feel like it so she took her shoes off and began to throw them around the classroom. she is peeing and pooping her pants on a daily basis sometimes 4-5 times a day. last week as well, she got up at 3:00am and sat in the middle of her floor, we told her that she needed to be in her bed because she had school in the morning and she needed her rest so that she could be awake to play the next day. she refused. her father had to scoop her up off the floor and put her in her bed and even getting her head down on the pillow was a hassle. she woke her 1 year old sister up in the process. although she has yet to harm her younger sister in a huge manor, i am afraid that she may or even hurt herself. the foster mom had told us that she used to have to hold her down because she would get so violent. she has and still is in psychiatry and play theory but nobody seems to have an answer other than anxiety. to me this seems to be more than anxiety. there is a history of bi-polar in her family and they are looking out for it but they say that it is very highly unlikely. i have mentioned to them odd and they gave me no response to this, they just changed the subject. she's not eating her meals, so i make sure to give her a vitamin every day so that she still gets the nutrition she needs. i have tried every discipline in the book. i have had facs, public health, and councilors give me advice and i've taken it but none of it is working. as for her peeing and pooping herself i have also taken her to the doctors for that to see if it was a medical problem and the results came back negative.it seems to me too that she likes to cause problems. the way that i explained it to her psychiatrist is that she has just lit a village on fire and she's sitting at the highest hilltop and watching everybody run for their lives. i saw one day that her father and i had got into an argument about how to deal with this situation and she sat on the couch, watching us, with a smile on her face. to me this seems defiant. it's almost like she's purposely trying to cause problems or maybe she's just trying to pry her father and i apart. whatever the case may be, something has to give.my patience is wearing thin and i try to be considerate of her situation but i can only be considerate so much before she takes advantage of it. i don't really know what to do and i think i could better cope and communicate with her better if i could find out what the problem is, whether it's medical or behavioural. what's your opinion on odd? what's your opinion on the matter?
3977,i had my iud removed today and for about an hour, i felt sick to my stomach and cramped, but after that, i've felt fine. no contractions anyway =) and the extreme back pain has lessened to just one area.are there any other side effects from the removal?
3978,my 19 year old daughter just told me that a year ago her 21 year old brother touched her inappropriately while she was half asleep.    at the time they talked about it and cried but now i don't know what to do.    i left them when they were 3 & 5 because of drugs and they have been raised by their father (child of an alcoholic) and mentally ill stepmom.    i'm very worried about my son who has not had a girlfriend or as far as i know any sexual experience.    i promised my daughter that i wouldn't say anything to him about this but i don't know what to do other than support her.    i'm very concerned about my son.
3979,i just had my fifth child and my oldest son who is 5 and the other boy who is 4 keep giving me trouble.    they never listen.    i try that 1-2-3 magic and they just laugh at me and throw stuff at me and just the other day my 5 year old threw a shoe at my head and laughed at me.    they never listenand i cant figure out what to do.    my 5 year old is even teaching my girls bad habits too.    my youngest is still in the hospital and not even my own mother wants to babysit them because they tear up her house, go through her purse and dont listen to her.    they tear up my house throw stuff at me and im supposed to be on bed rest but with these kids its impossible.    they know i have to rest but they dont care.    i cant physically punish them.    i've tried 1-2-3 magic, taking toys away, shutting off the t.v., not letting them go outside and nothing works.    i was even at tears a few times and they laughed at me.    and my 5 year old also tells my 1 year old daughter not to listen to me when i put her in time-out.    so help!!!!
3980,i take care of my niece full time as her mother has gone a separate way and my brother has to work full time to support her.i am very worried about her and me and my brother have no clue how to do these things as we were not her main caretaker for four years, and now that we have to be we noticed she wasn't raised up she was kept the same. she just turned four years old, and knows how to use the potty, knows how to keep her panties dry, but she refuses to do them. she picks a diaper or pull-up over her big girl undies. i need help teaching her to do that along with some other things. now my brother had adhd when he was a kids, and i think she may have it. she stares off into space or watches tv, and when you tell her somthing it takes her 5 times and grabbing somthing from her hands to get her to listen, then she just starts throwing a tantrum or screaming for 15 min.she refuses to sleep in her room, as she has never had to. so she sleeps with me on my air mattress, which is becoming difficult to make sure she isn't falling off the bed every 3 hours.another problem with bedtime is that we try to get her to sleep at 8- 8:30 but instead she stays awake looking around and bugging me till like 12-1 am.i need help and i am at wits end.
3981,9 year old son is shy outside of our house, around other people. but in front of people, he rarely smiles or speaks. he has a few friends, but no best friend. he seems a little nervous when meeting new people. should i be worried something has happened in his past that has traumatized him or will he break out of his shell when he gets ready?    thanks in advance.
3982,so i am curious about my iud.. my mother called me tonight and was talking to me about it, apparently she had seen something on the news saying that the iud could cause more problems than i had known about. saying things like that i have that possibility that i could not get pregnant after the removal and it could cause diseases and failures in my body... i am concerned i am only 20 years old and have had the iud for about 2 years, so i am kind of concerned. i have gained wait which has been extremely depressing. i don't have periods and i don't have cramps. it is uncomfortable while having sex and i have had a couple of partners tell me they can feel it and it hurts them... i am just trying to decide if i wanna still keep it in or take it out... what should i do? any opinions? i'm kind of scared.
3983,i had my blood drawn and it showed my ferritin as 19, my iron is fine though. my red blood cell count is at 4.43. i've been having problems with my health, my doctor and i have been trying to find out whats going on. he had my blood checked and it came back with the number i listed above. now he put me on ferrous gluconate 324mg once daily, i stayed on it for one month and then he took me off?! my question is if i'm having health problems wouldn't you want me at the optimum level of ferritin? cause hes just saying well your above the low range which they consider 8 for ferritin to be low isn't being lower around 19 ferritin not optimal? wouldn't it be better to be at a higher optimal range so we could make me feel my best?!
3984,my 10 year old son was really well behaved till he got to about 8 now he is uncontrollable. he is the eldest of 3 children he doesn't think twice about hitting and pushing his 2 and 4 year old siblings. at the moment he lives at his nan's house as he says he hates me and his step father. if he comes into the house when were both here he'll start throwing things at both of us and neither of us know why. he has smashed up heaters and will throw anything that gets in his way. my mum has told him about his uncle going to a boarding school for being naughty when he was younger. he was his role model for a few years but i'm going to have a nervous breakdown he doesn't listen to anything anyone says. even my mum has had enough she has told him to come home and he won't. please can you help????
3985,hi all,i'm looking for information on the ideal diet (nutritionally speaking) for a healthy, reasonably active average male.i'm not talking about servings of this or that - i'm interested in the core information such as how many grams of protein, carbs, fiber, fat that one should eat per day.thanks in advance for any useful links or other info anyone can provide.

3987,my (7 year old) step-son recently smeared his feces in the bacthroom as if it was fingerpaint. this is not the first time he has done it, just the worst it has ever been. when asked why he did it, he replied that he missed his mother. (he lives in another state with his mother.) he was sexually molested by his mother's nephew (his cousin, also a minor) a few years ago and did see a doctor for a little bit. his mother is in the process of another divorce, they moved out of the home and into a hotel with her 20 year old boyfriend and her soon to be ex husband has custody of the 2 foster children they were attempting adopt. the obvious answer is for him to see a specialist/doctor, but his mother refuses. what can we do?

3989,i am not sure i am writing this in the correct place since i just joined! my son is almost 19, he graduated from high school this last june- getting him through high school was a real struggle! 13 years ago my older son who had major bi-polar w/psychotic features took his life , he was 18. my son's father walked out on us when he was 5, then he lost his brother through suicide. i have another son who is married and is really responsible and kind. my almost 19  year old son sleeps all day and stays up all night-he wants to be a pro skater (he claims, but i don't see him skating much, claims he hurt his ankle) he is a good skater, well known here, has sponsers and videos out. he smokes pot and claims he will never stop. he says he will work one day but needs time to pursue his dream of skating! i have worked very hard to always provide a good home for him - he was so traumatized from losing his brother that he slept w/me until he was in 2nd grade- i have always loved him so- he gave me $2,000.00 and i gave him my new honda and bought another one! i pay his car insurance and health insurance, i pay his cell phone but i told him i am going to quit in sept.- he yells at me and speaks to me like he hates me-he cusses all the time-once in awhile he will come to me and try to be nice - then hes back to his usual self again- i feel like i am living with an abusive husband! i lock my bedroom door because i think if he hates me this much what is he capable of? this seems so unfair cause i went through so much with my other son when he was ill. my friends tell me to cut him off financially-if i tell him he will have to go he just say no! i know alot of people will say boot him our or call the police-this is hard cause i had to call the police on my son that took his life many times-this hurts me to the core-what can i do? i have stress related conditions and i want to live again! i love my son as we all love our children but this abuse is too much for me!

3992,my 2 year old daughter was a great sleeper (13 hrs/night with a 2-3 hour nap)    she always slept in her own crib, in her own room.    i put her down, said goodnight and she lied herself down and went to sleep.     not a problem.    suddenly, one week ago, she stopped.    she won't sleep in her crib (nap or night)    she won't lay down in my bed (desperate attempt on my part).    she won't take a nap at all anywhere.     and, on top of it, she will not let me out of her sight for even a minute...extreme seperation anxiety.     we have spent the last week sleeping or not sleepign on the couch together...the only place i can get her the lie down with me.     oh, i did try ferber...3 hours straight of her yelling and bouncing in the crib.    (i gave up)    i can now get her to go to sleep in the crib at around 7pm    after 30 minutes of crying...but she wakes up sometime during the night and we are back on the couch.at first i thought i was a virus, then i thought it was a flu mist. then i thought it was teething.    the child who was getting 16 hours of sleep is now lucky to get 8-10 hours.    she is exhausted!    i am doing anything to get her to sleep anywhere.     i'm exhausted.     i'm tapped out of ideas.    should i go to a toddler bed?    how do i reassure her that i'm not leaving her if she falls asleep?

3996,i am by no mean am a perfect mom. i have made my fair share of mistakes, so please go easy on me. i have 2 sons, ages 12 and 15 that live with me. neither have a relationship with thier fathers. i have been with my husband for 7years, married for 1. i have always babied my 12 year old, since he was born my thought was he's my last one, i'd give him anything. when i met my husband he thought i was too easy on my son. he was only 4. (i know now i was) husband has 3 girls and 2 of them ages 11 and 8 come to visit every other weekend. my husband is very hard on my youngest son, and has no issues with my 15 year old. my youngest son causes massive fights in the family, normaly because he has done something wrong and i feel its my job to stick up and defend him even when he is wrong. i have been a pot smoker for 13 years, (yes before my son was born) never around my kids or in the house. i hid it in the barn apartment for years. two weeks ago my youngest son snuck out of the house and into the apartment (no kids allowed in apartment) he stole weed and brought it in the house. husbands daughter told him about it. i had so much guilt for having it around that it was hard for me to punish him in any way shape or form. my husband was furious, he seen it as my son was jepordizing his kids and his ability to see them. for over a week husband and i fought and my son sat in his room. (everything was taken away from him). finally it exploded between my husband and i. a huge arguement began, lots of things were said, he called me white trash and i hit him. he called the cops and told them i had hit him. i did not go to jail, i think because my sons were here. i took my kids and left for a few days. we came home and all of us agreeded that we would try to be more patient with eachother and try to get along. two days later my son was looking for a alen wrench, husband told him do not get into my tools. twenty minutes later, my son comes in crying, and my husband right behind him yelling. he had gotten into the tools anyway. he was again grounded and punshied (he weeded the garden for 3 days). i thought for sure he had relized that he had done wrong and would not mess up again anytime soon. two days later my oldest son came to me and told me that my 12yr old took one of my cigarettes and smoked it. i was sooo furious, i asked the 12yr old what he had done and he completley lied. finally when i got the belt out he told me what he had done. by that time i had lost my temper and spanked him with the belt. (i have never done this before). i feel so guilty for allowing the situation to get to this degree. there is lots more to the story but i am going to try to sum it up. my son will stand there and stare at you when you ask him to do something, like he didnt hear you, but hes just ignoring me. when he does have a chore or something to do, he will take his time, a 15 min chore turns into a 2 hour project. when you ask him something most of the time he whispers in such a low voice you can not hear him. ask him again and same thing, untill i yell at him. i know he has snuck out of the house and toilet papered the neighbors down the road. his bus driver last year said he will not listen to her, and was kicked off the bus 3 times. his teachers say that he will not do what is asked. so i know its not just at home. it has gotten to the point i just don't know what to do anymore. my husband is so fed up he wants us to move out so that he does not have to deal with it anymore. i don't see that as a option my 15 yr old and i don't want to move. i don't know what to do anymore. i have called a counsler and my son starts next wednesday. i just don't know if that is going to be enough to save my family, or help my son.    any advise will be helpful.

4001,i have noticed that my 7yr year old daughter has started day dreaming and rolls her eyes backwards when we talk to her it doesn't happen all the time. she doesn't realise that she is doing it.    she is a happy child with a relatively stress free life.    is this anything thing to be concerned about and what should i be doing to rectify the situation?

4004,hi everyone,i wasn't sure where to post this so nutrition sounded like the best category. i am experiencing candida overgrowth symtems based on the research i've done online. i don't think my doctor has ruled it out but he seems more concerned in finding other causes for my symptoms. my symptoms are primarily angular cheilitis and abdominal cramping. oherwise i'm pretty healthy. the angular cheilitis always gets worse when i increase my sugar consumption, that is why i highly suspect candida overgrowth. so i'm wondering if others have experience with this condition and/or symptoms.thank you very much for any help.john

4009,i have been reading great things about the abs diet wondering if anyone has some insight on the excercie you have to do to make this work. i have ist and have been cleared to work out but my heart rate runs high and i am unable to jog or anything like this for long times and get overheated easily. i have to get some weight off for my health i am only 26 and have hit 228 since i developed ist. i was 176 when i developed ist but i had a baby last nov and never got a chance to get in the gym and get any weight off before this heart rate issue came up. any ideas or information would be greatly appreciated.
4010,my son is a little over 2 years.    he is very sweet and loving at times but then in an instant turns violent and angry.    me and my mom take care of him together and we try to teach him not to touch things hes not supposed to and so on....but hes gotten more aggressive and has even injured each of us very badly a few times.    he knows i have injuries to my legs but continues to kick, hit and slap me when ever he can.    saying no...doesnt always help.....and time-outs are like a joke he get out of his crib and play-pen now so theres no real safe place to put him away for us too.    i broke down and cried other day because ive been at my wits end when he hit me with one of his toys on my leg ( the injured one) and when i took it away he had a tantrum for almost 1 hour throwing himself on the floor hitting his head and occassionally hitting or trying to kick me when he realized i was trying to ignore him.    you are right : hitting has no effect....he just looks at me with no reaction if i do that so i figured that was pointless.im not sure if he may have a medical condition or if its just a phase.....but both my mom and i are tiring of this and getting hurt.....i also tried asking his doctor but he blew it off as nothing and i never got any response.....is there something else i can try to calm him down and be nice ??    i tell you ive endured alotta pain....but no medicine of mine is gonna cure the way im feeling about all this......i also dont know if he's hurting inside and doesnt know how to express it....im really confused.    thank you if you have any answers or suggestions.

4012,ten realizations about mainstream medicinewhen it comes to whether mainstream medicine really works, here are ten important reality check realizations to keep in mind:#1) if mainstream medicine really worked, then drug companies wouldn't have to commit scientific fraud to fake their clinical trials, would they?#2) if mainstream medicine really worked, then doctors, drugs companies and the fda wouldn't be afraid of competition from nutritional supplements and natural remedies, and they wouldn't keep trying to censor or outlaw those natural remedies.#3) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would gladly test their drugs side-by-side with nutritional remedies to see what works best. (http://www.naturalnews.com/028473_z...)#4) if mainstream medicine really worked, health insurance costs would be extremely low. the only reason health insurance costs so much is because mainstream medicine doesn't cure anybody, and patients stay sick, which costs more money to keep treating!#5) if mainstream medicine really worked, then all the other countries in the world would be looking at the u.s. health care system and saying, wow, we want that!#6) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would be out of business because virtually everybody would be healthy and therefore not need drugs on an ongoing basis.#7) if mainstream medicine really worked, doctors would largely put themselves out of business by teaching patients how to take care of their own health.#8) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies like johnson & johnson wouldn't have to pay kickbacks (bribes) to nursing homes to entice them to push more of their drugs onto helpless senior citizens.#9) if mainstream medicine really worked, the treatment of teenagers with chemotherapy wouldn't have to be enforced by court order with the threat of arrest and imprisonment of the parents (as happens in the u.s. today). (http://www.naturalnews.com/abraham_...)#10) if mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies wouldn't need to advertise on television to persuade people to take drugs they don't need.now, to hear mainstream medicine pushers say it, the only reason americans are so sick and diseased right now is because -- get this -- not enough people are taking enough medications!yes... if they could only convince more parents to drug more babies and toddlers; or if they could get more teens on four, five or six drugs at once; or if they could convince nursing homes to pop a dozen different meds into the mouths of senior citizens then we'd all be healthier!america, you see, suffers from a medication deficiency. that's the line of mainstream medicine: more meds = less disease. and now, they're trying to convince everyone that even healthy people now need meds (statin drugs) even if they show no symptoms of disease.so now -- get this -- being healthy is no longer enough to avoid medications! we're all supposed to be medicated, whether we're healthy or not.mainstream medicine, you see, isn't satisfied to just treat sick people with its medications, radiation machines and surgical procedures: it wants to put all the healthy people on pills, too.and what will be the result of all this? imagine in your own mind, for a moment: what will be the result if, say, americans start taking twice as much medication as they do right now. will americans be healthier?of course not. they will be more diseased. more medicated and chemically contaminated. the fish downstream will be even more polluted with pharmaceutical runoff and the bio sludge human waste compost products now being put on farms will be even more heavily saturated with medication chemicals.will that create health for america? of course not. mainstream medicine does not work. and pushing mainstream medicine onto more people will only cause more sickness, more suffering and more bankruptcies across american households.it will, however, accomplish one very important thing: the obscene financial enrichment of a few powerful corporations like pfizer, merck, johnson & johnson and astrazeneca.and that, my friends, is the entire point of mainstream medicine: to mainline the profits for big pharma, sideline the legitimate health problems of the american people, and streamline the criminal soaking of the rich, the poor and the recently-insured in order to turn sickness into profit.that's mainstream medicine for you. i'm sure glad i don't use it.http://www.naturalnews.com/028561_mainstream_medicine_health_care.html

4017,i once had a counselor tell me if i was in a room full of men, i would be drawn to the alcholic ones.    true, i have been married twice and both were alcholics.    i am still married to the second one, but what can i do help him?    i have been to alanon and it helped for a while with the first husband, but i work two jobs and i come home to a drunk husband who works only one job.    i feel like somehow i contribute to his drinking but don't know why i think this way.    he's 44 years old and knows better.
4018,im not really looking for cosmet surgery, but here's my problem;im 'm 16 now in 11th grade. ever since 3rd grade when i had glasses i slept with them sometimes. now i have a dent on each side of my face towards the front of my ear where the arms of the glasses were just lodged into my head when i slept on the side of my face. i just noticed these dents recently and it really blow me self esteem away. i stoped wearing my glasses about a month ago and im just wondering, has anyone else had this problem and did it fix itself or did you just live with it?it gives the illusion that i have a big head like one of those smart kids from a cartoon and my self esteem is really low right now.. will this fix itself with time or would i need cosmetic surgery...?
4019,hi,i am 43 years old and about ten years ago started breaking out and gradually became allergic to certain foods and all alcohol. the last three years i have been on low dose accutane, although my derm wanted me to do a much higher dose, my body just couldn't take it so i do my own dosage of 20 mgs per week. i try to prolong it as long as i can. now, on top of this i also take antihistamines for my allergies. i am basically dried up. my skin, which was once very soft and pretty is now tight and itchy, obviously from all of the dehydrating drugs. i have a great relationship with clean food and only imbibe on the weekends, though nothing crazy (i.e fast food). i don't drink flavoured sodas, eat junk or over drink (yes, i still drink). i am currently taking liquid vitamin d3. about 5000 ius a day hoping that maybe this is the reason for all the body wars inside. i was tested and had a low, but not detrimental, number count on my vitamin d score. is there a supplement i can take that will help with all this dryness? i can't bathe in creams any longer. they don't work, most stink and i wanna to work from the inside. any suggestions?

4026,vitamins: it's dose that does itreprinted with permission from the international schizophrenia foundation, www.orthomed.orgeditor  s note: the following article focuses on the therapeutic effect of very high dose vitamins. lower doses commonly found in dietary supplements are effective in meeting nutritional needs, but no therapeutic claims are made.(omns, february 2, 2009) there is a spin to most media reporting on vitamin research. the recent anti-vitamin media blitz, led by the associated press and usa today, provides yet another demonstration. (vitamins c and e don't prevent heart disease. the associated press, nov. 9, 2008. also: usa today http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-11-09-supplements-study_n.htm ) with a paternalistic pat on the head, the media once again seeks to send you off to play with the reassurance that, well, vitamin therapy has been tested, and it just does not work.nonsense. thousands upon thousands of nutritional research studies provide evidence that vitamins do help prevent and treat serious diseases, including cancer and heart disease, when the nutrients are supplied in sufficiently high doses. high doses are required. low doses fail. says cardiologist thomas levy, m.d.: the three most important considerations in effective vitamin c therapy are dose, dose, and dose. if you don't take enough, you won't get the desired effects.effective doses are high doses, often hundreds of times more than the us recommended dietary allowance (rda) or daily reference intake (dri). abram hoffer, m.d., ph.d., comments: drs. wilfrid shute and evan shute recommended doses from 400 iu to 8,000 iu of vitamin e daily. the usual dose range was 800 to 1600 iu but they report that they had given 8,000 iu without seeing any toxicity. the shutes successfully treated over 35,000 patients with vitamin e.all the recent, much touted jama study does is confirm what we already know: low doses do not work. the doses given were 400 iu of vitamin e every other day and 500 milligrams of vitamin c/day. try that same study with 2,000 to 4,000 iu of vitamin e every other day (1,000 to 2,000 iu/day) and 15,000-30,000 mg/day of vitamin c and the difference would be unmistakable. we know this because investigators using vitamins e and c in high doses have consistently reported success.low doses do not get clinical results. any physician, nurse, or parent knows that a dose of antibiotics that is one tenth, or one-hundredth, of the known effective dose will not work. indeed, it is a cornerstone of medical science that dose affects outcome. this premise is accepted with pharmaceutical drug therapy, but not with vitamin therapy. most of the best-publicized vitamin e and c research has used inadequate, low doses, and this jama study falls right into line.high doses of vitamins are deliberately not used. writes robert f. cathcart iii, m.d.: i have been consulted by many researchers who proposed bold studies of the effects of massive doses of ascorbate (vitamin c). every time the university center, the ethics committee, or the pharmacy committee deny permission for the use of massive doses of ascorbate and render the study almost useless. seasoned researchers depending upon government grants do not even try to study adequate doses.the most frequently proffered reason is the allegation that high doses of vitamins are not safe. that is a myth. 25 years of national poison control statistics show that there is not even one death per year from vitamins. check the research literature and see for yourself exactly who is being harmed by vitamins. aside from the pharmaceutical industry, virtually nobody. half of americans take vitamin supplements every day. so where are the bodies?decades of physicians' reports and controlled research studies support the use of large doses of vitamins. yet to hear the media (and jama) tell it, vitamins are a granny's folk remedy: a buggy- and barrel-stave technology that just doesn't make it.in the broadcast and print media, vitamin therapy is marginalized at best and derided at worst. is this merely laughable, or is there method to it? one may start by asking, who does this serve? could it possibly be the media's huge advertising-cash providers, the pharmaceutical industry? pharmaceutical advertising money buys authors, ad space, influence, and complicity. unfortunately, this is as true in the newspapers as it is in the medical journals.let the news media begin by disclosing exactly where their advertising revenue comes from. it may explain where the spin on their articles comes from, too.nutritional medicine is orthomolecular medicine. orthomolecular medicine uses safe, effective nutritional therapy to fight illness. for more information: http://www.orthomolecular.org
4027,my 5 year old son has been regurgitating food and fluids since end of august following a tummy bug...........he was treated for suspected milk allergy/reflux as a baby but seemed to grow out of it about 3 1/2 years , then started with small amounts of fluid coming up involuntarily, and after the gastroenteritis was having 10+ episodes following each meal. we went to gp and got antiemitic drugs and antacids. after a few weeks the symptoms had reduced to 5+ times a day but not gone, so we were referred to gastro specialist who has just done an endoscopy and ph test.has anyone else ever encountered this - it is not full on vomiting, just involuntary regurgitation.

4031,i have a 9 year old girl that used to be an amazing sleeper and never had any type of fear issues.    we live in a 3 girl house of disney princesses and family channel without any scary stuff at all.    a month ago we had a friend sleep over and during the sleepover, they told each other scary stories.    well, since that time, my 9 year old and my 6 year old will not sleep alone, go into the basement alone, go to the bathroom alone, or go anywhere alone.    they are joined at the hip.    i think the 6 year old is mostly milking it, however my 9 year old is in a panic and will start crying hysterically and lying so she does not have to be alone.    pre scary story, the 9 year old has rarely cried and has always been very neutral, now, she gets almost hysterical if we make her shower alone.    we have tried splitting up the 2 of them and making them sleep alone, we have tried splitting them up and sleeping with them, nothing seems to work!    we have tried talking about the story, we have tried rainbows, bubble gum and unicorns...ideas, suggestions, help of any kind is appreciated
4032,our son is 6 years old. he has autisum. the problem we have is that he seemed to find his self privatly, and sexualy. on a daily basis he grabs himself through his pants. after his bath this evening, i applyed loation to his body, while i was waiting for it to dry, he was nude, i noticed he was stroking himself, he had a small erection not fully, but i stopped him, im just wondering if this behavior is normal, or should i worry that something could be happing to him?
4033,my eight year old son appears to most as a highly intelligent, beautiful and caring young boy. but then he goes to school and he turns into a monster (according to his teachers). over the past several weeks, his behaviour has progressively deteriorated - he has started hurting the other children, pushing them over and hitting them (boys and girls). the teacher has disciplined him every time and he spends most of the day outside the principles office. the school is now threatening to suspend him.he has started seeing the school councillor to work through his issues (what ever they may be!). but when you ask him what he did, he has a very different account of what happened, saying it was only a fun punch or he didn't yell in class, he was only calling out the answers.we have tried dipscipling him at home for this behaviour- removing his favourite toys, but this only inflames the situation because he thinks there is nothing more that can be taken away from him, so why should he be good?when he doesn't get his own way at home - he back chats and has to have the last word and can also be very cheeky (his answers are always highly intelligent). he threatens to throw things, but never actually does - he just wants to scare you.nothing has changed at home for this behaviour to become evident and he says he likes his teacher and the school -does anyone else have similar issues with their kids? i see other parents with their children and wish mine could be more like that....i'm at breaking point.
4034,my 6 year old grandaughter repeats what she says sometimes as much as 4 times or more, even when she knows the answer. she also asks silly questions like what is your name? when she knows our names. also, she sometimes doesn't seem to hear us. we have had her hearing checked? what is the cause of this behavior?

4036,his mom is my friend who is a single mom, and he is my god-son.    he didn  t listen and even hit her sometimes; therefore, she asked me to help her by taking care of him.    five months ago, he moved in with us and called my husband   daddy   and me   mommy  ; however, we let him talks to his real mom every night.he was very good for the first few weeks, but then he has been really bad lately.    he doesn  t seem to listen to us and his teachers.    he talks too much in class that his teachers have to create a weekly behavior chart for him, but it doesn  t seem to work because he still talks anyway.    i asked him why, he told us that because he wanted to tell people things.    the teachers complained and called us several times a month because of his misbehavior.    then yesterday, he got into a fight with one of the boys on the bus just because that boy stared at him.    we asked him what and why that happened.    he told us that he hit that boy because he didn  t like the way that boy looked at him.    we explained to him why he should not do that, but he kept telling us that he just didn  t like the way that boy looked at him.and, he doesn  t want to study at all and lies about everything.    he keeps making excuses so that he doesn  t have to read and study.    we  ve talked to him, but he keeps giving us more lies.    everyday, we talk to him, help him with school, tell him that we love him and hug him,   .., and even spank him.    we have tried all the things that we know, but none of them working.    please help  ..    thanks very much!
4037,my son was diag with adhd when he was in 3rd grade. when then put him on medication and that went well he did good in school grades came up but then he had ugly mood swings when he would not take it and he did not each much and he did not like how it made him feel. he then decided he was did not want to take it anymore so in 6th grade we stop the medication. it has been a struggle to get him through middle school. he starts high school this year and i am so looking for maybe a more natural way to help him with his adhd, his main problem is organization and attention span, sometimes he gives me the attitude but that  s not as bad as it was before.. i guess i am just wondering if anyone out there feels like me that medication is not the only answer for adhd? any sugg? ideas would be greatly appreciated ;)

4044,vitamin d continues to show promise for mental healthnutrition for optimal wellness | greg arnold | parkinson disease (pd) is characterized by tremors, slowness of movement, stiffness, and difficulty with balance. the condition affects more than 1.5 million americans, with 60,000 new cases each year. it costs the u.s. healthcare system more than $5.6 billion per year, with medication costs for an individual patient averaging $2,500 a year and therapeutic surgery costing up to $100,000 dollars per patient.possible causes of pd include oxidative stress and a high homocysteine level. fortunately, nutrition, including increases in both unsaturated fat and vitamin e intake and vitamin b-6, is becoming a viable way to help protect against pd. now a new study has found that vitamin d, whose numerous health benefits include heart health, blood sugar health, prostate health, bone health, breast cell health, longevity mental health, dental health, and back health, may also help with mental health.previous research has shown that vitamin d deficiency adversely affects nerve function. building on these findings, researchers selected 100 patients with diagnosed pd, 100 patients with alzheimer disease (ad), and 100 healthy patients with an average age of 65 years from the clinical research in neurology (crin) database from the emory university school of medicine. they examined the patients   blood samples to look at vitamin d blood levels.   vitamin d insufficiency   was defined as having vitamin d blood levels below 30 nanograms per milliliter and   vitamin d deficiency   was defined as vitamin d blood levels below 20 nanograms per millilter.the researchers found that 55% of the pd patients had vitamin d insufficiency compared to 41% of ad patients and 36% of controls. regarding vitamin d deficiency, 23% of the pd patients were deficient compared to 16% of ad patients and 10% of the controls.with results supported by previous research examining vitamin d and pd, the researchers   found that pd patients have a higher prevalence of vitamin d insufficiency compared with patients with ad and healthy controls  . they called for future research to address whether vitamin d supplementation would improve pd symptoms.

4048,hello. i am 43 years old. i had a tubal years ago, so no more children. i had blood tests done to see if i am menopausal (results not back). i recently had a vaginal ultrasound because of heavy, irregular periods and pain during periods, in abdomen, in pelvis, and during intercourse.    i blamed this pain on fibromyalgia (diagnosed 9 yrs ago). my test results showed 'samll uterine fibroid, some ovary cysts, and thickened endometrium.    gyn. gave me progesterone (sp?).    she said this should help with periods.    i didn't tell her about all the pain because i blamed it on the fms, but after researching this, i realize the pain is from these problems. does this mean surgery? thank you for your reply.

4053,i'm not sure if this is all related, but for the past 2 months, approximately the same time that he received the flumist vaccine, he has had random fevers.    he will feel    fine all day and out of the blue will feel warm, usually with a fever around 101, this is accompanied by body aches, headache (sinus pain/pressure). usually the fever is brought down by motrin and he sleeps off the pain. he wakes up    feeling fine after a nap.his pcm is saying this is all allergies and sent him for a tb test (negative), ct scan and has run a bunch of blood work (waiting for results on the blood work). he is currently on amoxicillin (day 5 of 7). after another fever last night the dr on    call, sent us to the er. of course by the time we were seen the fever was gone and after    looking at his ct scan and seeing it was clear, the er dr said that it was no way sinus' or allergies, and suggested seeing an infectious disease expert.is the pcm n the right track, or the er dr? trying to figure out where to direct my husband so that when he    goes into the military clinic tomorrow and they are trying to get rid of him, he    knows what he needs to get the correct care and not the run around.

4057,hi.my symptoms are numbness on the right side of my body, mainly my hand and foot.    though in my worse times it can affect my left.    i have good time and bad as far as coping with the tingles and heavieness.    this has been occuring for 6yrs.    just this last year i went to talk to docs about it.    i have had many tests.    emg, vascular test, mri, blood work.    the only abnormalities that came back was a 200pg/ml in b12, sed of 2 mm/hr, and my b6 was in a toxic range.    in may of 2009, i was concerned about my weight(~200lbs) so the pa i saw prescribed me with phentermine(15mg) and metformin(500mg).    they made me jittery, so i stopped after one month.    i do not take a multivitamin and i do eat healthy.how am i supposed to cut out b6?    i have been taking 2000ug b12 for 5weeks.every doc i talk to says i probably have ms.    should i maybe see a specialist for ms or keep seeing my neurologist?    when we were going through my test results his only suggestion was to stop taking b6....but i am not taking anything nor eating anything so much that i have such high levels.    it seems there has to be something else going on here.help, please?

4066,is there any women out there who take maca?    i have started 3days ago and am finding positive results. i am interested in knowing why they take it and what are their results. thanks rusalka
4067,alright, i went to the doctor with complaints about sharp pains in my abdomen. usually they start on my upper left side quite intensly and i'll feel it in the right side a little later and less intensly. after that i'll get a general discomfort all around my lower abdomen (not on any side in particular).my doctor suggested i add more fiber to my diet (i'm a vegetarian so i tend to eat a lot already), get a source of psyllium which i can get through eating kelloggs all bran buds in the morning, and cutting out beans and lentils which may be giving me some gassy problems and making my pain worse.the thing is that i don't really think that fiber is my problem, although my digestive system seems to be working rather slowly... my stools aren't really hard when they come out... just hard to get out. sometimes i even have diarrhea. so does this mean my problems might be more gas related? and what should i substitute for beans so that i can still get a good source of protein?

4072,hello ladies, i am new to this forum and i am coming here for help. in august 2006, while 13 weeks pregnant i lost both of my ovaries do to cyst rapping around them. first happened at 13 weeks, second at 16 weeks. (baby survived-thank god) dr. said that once i stop breastfeeding, one small pill will fix it all. right! in december 2007, i stop breastfeeding my daughter and try to get into my obg office, but they could not see me until march. so i waited patiently. unfortunately, in february 2008 my body went into hormonal roller couster and obg saw me right away. put me on angeliq hormone, but by this time i was already so depressed and emotional that angeliq was doing nothing for me. (since i had no menopausal symptoms, i assumed it was suppose to take care of all the emotional symptoms) in july 2008 they did not know what else to do since my depression was not getting any better, so they sent me to psychiatrist who put me on the smallest dose of lexapro. that helped and finally a month ago, i got off of it.    anyway, my obg office is more interested in prego females which are bringing the big $$$ then the depressed pathetic me, so i have recently switched obg and found a couple husband and wife who are only seeing females like me...with such problems. i like them a lot, but by now i am so confused that i do not know what is right. so, before i ask my questions, here are few more details.i am 35 years old, have no ovaries, just uterus...i have no hot flashes, sweating, no symptoms if i do not take any estrogen. i am taking vitamins my new obg selected for me. i work out 4-5 times a week cardio. i take no hormones, as my new obg said there is no need since i have no symptoms. emotionally, i am 80% better, but not complete. i did noticed, my sex drive is pretty low.is there any of you who are in similar situation and take no hormones? should i be taking some estrogen and perhaps little progesterone since i still have my uterus therefore, could get cancer? is there something else i should be doing to take a better care of myself?i appreciate any/all comments.thank you,petanka
4073,i had many menopausal symptoms during my periomenopause.    i had a total hysterectomy in january 2006 because of the results of my hysteroscopy and a mri.    right after the operation, i lost weight and was so excited; now i'm 20 lbs heavier which makes me heavier than i've ever been in my life.    june 16, 2007 i started having nocturnal seizures(diagnosed as non-epileptic).    i was diagnosed with cat scratch dissease in february 2007 (no wound sample taken)    i've been having a rough year.    i have been suffering from depression and anxiety since 2002.    is it possible that the seizure activity and depression are brought on by hormonal changes?
4074,i had a hysterectomy two years ago.    i have noticed a change in my hair growth.    the hair on my head is full and thick.    the hair on my body seems to be disappearing.    it takes several weeks to grow enough underarm and leg hair to shave and even then it is sparse.    not complaining about having to shave less often, just wondering if this is normal.    i am not taking any kind of hormonal treatment because everything else is normal except for the hot flashes.
4075,i am considering having weight loss surgery and have been researching both the lap band procedure and open gastric bypass.    i was definitely leaning toward the lap band because of the shorter recoup time and ability to do adjustments as needed, but then i read that it was not suggested for people with immune problems, which i have (lupus).does anyone know why that is?
4076,i rubbed some garlic on my left arm to remove about 3 pimples on my left arm. they disappeared and left pimple scars which i can probably resolve with grape speed oil. after a couple of days, another 4 pimples grew back in the same area. could this be bacteria or infection because i don't think rubbing garlic did much but irritate them, and all they did was shift to different spots on my skin. are there any remedies to kill off these bacterias/germs so that they don't create more pimple scars on my left arm. it's annoying.
4077,my mum has had a bag for a few months now, and she's just started chemotherapy about 3 months ago. whenever she goes through a treatment the wounds around the stoma open. often it becomes quiet large and it bleeds a little bit, she is also on a blood thinner. i've taken to taping the bag down so the edges seal, but we're at our wits end.any ideas on healing the wound or at least keeping the bag down so nothing leaks?also, she has been having an acid like discharge, would this be the cause of citrus fruits, etc?
4078,got this darn illy surgery (temporary) in dec. 2010. does it ever get any better?    constantly emptying it , frequent burning sensation and breakdown of skin around site.don't know how much more i can take-i am sooooo uncomfortable. got 2-3 months more to go and been told someday i may need one permantly.
4079,i've been a vegetarian for the last five years, almost. there were a few points where i was vegan for months at a time. right now i do eat eggs and some dairy occasionally but no fish. i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about three years ago...but i have reason to believe that i had it long before. i remember how my body felt years ago...so i don't want to blame vegetarianism for my hypothyroidism. getting to my point- i've had pretty bad memory loss for a few years now as well. i'm not sure if it's related to the vegetarianism though. i personally think it's more associated with the hypothyroidism. i make sure i get b vitamins, calcium, omega fatty acids in my diet. i've had my levels checked for the typical bloods and everything seems normal. it's just this memory problem...i don't want to go back to eating meat. but what else can i do to try to help this...along the lines of including things in my diet? anyone have this problem and find a solution or are struggling to? thanks
4080,i find myself getting really tired sometimes when i eat, i just feel horribly drained and can barely keep my eyes open, most times i can't fight it and end up taking a nap. it's getting to the point where some days i'm in bed more than i'm awake, which i know is obviously not good for me. i find it usually happens when i eat pasta or soup with crackers, so i'm guessing it's sugar/carbs related. i can't afford to cut these things out of my diet as i'm on unemployment right now and can barely afford pastas and soups as it is, i'd love to be able to eat lots of vegatables but i can't afford them and they don't last long enough even if i could. is there anything i can do to stop this from happening? it's getting to the point where i have to choose to either be starving all day or exausted all day.does anyone have any tips they can lend me?thanks,h
4081,does anyone know a way to remove a beckers nevous?    it's sort of like    a birthmark but doesn't come out for years.

4086,my son is 17yrs old and i feel so helpless in trying to figure out what is wrong with him.    since june of 2011, he has had terrible stomach pains, nauseated and throws up at least two or three times a week. he has undergone an ultrasound of his intestines, had several vials of blood drawn for tests, an endoscopy and a hydra scan too.    we thought he may have had celiacs disease, due to our middle son has it, but all tests say otherwise.    we also thought that maybe he has been having a tough time at school, but his grades are awesome and he has a lot of friends.    i don't think that he could possibly be being picked on, due to he is a black belt in tae kwon do and working towards another belt in jujitsu.    so i don't think it's a nervous condition.    the specialist is now short of doing a colonoscopy on my son to see if anything shows up there.    has anyone experienced this, or any family members?    i so hope and pray that my son gets some relief very soon.

4095,is it safe to go back and forth on remeron dosage?i was taking remeron(mirtazapine) for 4 monthes. i had a sudden yet long occurence with anxiety, and it caused insomnia too. the doctor put me on remeron for the time being. it helped pretty well. 15mg per night.i started feeling bad again last month. went to the doctor and she tested my adrenals. they came back relativly high with low testoterone. she decided to try adrenal medication on me hoping my anxiety and issues were stemming from that. she thought it would be a good idea to get off the remeron , as my body is sooo sensitive to medication. i tried. i cut it in half, skipped every other night, and my anxiety came back with a vengeance. i don't know if its from the discontiuation of it, or my anxiety just got worse. i took a half last night and finally slept again. doc said if i have to go back to original dose to stabilize, that would be ok , but that was over a week ago. shes out of town so i cant call her, and i was wanting to go back to the original dose tonight, as my anxiety is terrible, but being that i have been all over the map with dosages the last 2 weeks, i didn't know if it would really mess me up jumping back to the whole 15mg. please help if you have any knowledge of this. thank you.
4096,i am a 55 year old male and i have been having strange but excruciatingly painful electric like jolts in my knee. they come at random several times a day in strange electric pangs that are so painful that i scream sometimes when they happen. however after the episode my knee feels completely normal.    it feels almost like someone is shocking my nerve ending or something. the pain is indescribable. i have no pain anywhere else and i have never felt anything like this up until a couple months ago and just recently i went like 2 weeks with no jolts? they seem to happen most often when i am stitting down. my knee looks completely normal, no swelling or redness and its not tender to the touch at all. do i have ms? i am freaking out.
4097,i had a lumpectomy 2 years ago and have been on tamoxifen for 2 years.    after i started taking tamoxifen (age 52) my periods stopped for about 6 months and then started again about once every 3 or 4 months with the last one being quite heavy.    i am 54 years old and i was still pretty regular before the tamoxifen.    my gynecologist is recommending that i get a radical (abdominal) hysterectomy since i am still having periods.    i had a d&c last year and had a benign polyp removed.    just had a trans-vaginal ultrasound 2 weeks ago and everything was fine. my gynecologist thinks that i should not be having any periods at all at my age and because of the chance of uterine cancer with the tamoxifen he feels that a radical hysterectomy is the way to go.    just looking to hear other opinions.

4106,hello all i just decided to see what the side effects of mirena were after being told how wonderful it was and that it had very little side effects. i was talked into it after having my 3rd child in 4yrs and because they couldn't tie my tubes right after delivery due to complications this was the next best thing.....i have had headaches for a long time but since getting this thing i have had the most god awful headaches...they are so severe the past 2 or 3 times i have considered going to the er. they are what you call cluster headaches which in a way are worse than a migraine (they start on one side of my face mainly at night while i am sleeping, my eyeball will feel like it is going to pop out from the pressure, it goes all the way down my neck and than it will switch sides or be on one side of my head and down the back of my head....sometimes it will last for more than a day or go away than come back) and i got them before but maybe every 6 mos or so now i am getting them about every 2 wks or more if i don't catch it in timei was also suffering from bad post partum depression but they still did the insert and now i feel a cross between a zombie and a raving lunatic but thought it was just me.....i have noticed some weight gain but i honestly hardly eat as i don't have much of an appetite.....i had pain with sex and after was even worse and than when it gets close to that time of the month i hurt so bad in my ovaries.....right after having it inserted i bled for i think 3 or 4 months straight but thought it was normali was already under a lot of stress before having this thing put in but this seems to have made it all worse and i feel so guilty because i know my little ones are suffering because i just don't feel well ever and right now i am so depressed with raging mood swings....lately my whole body aches like i have arthritis or somethinganother thing is anyone else having there sleep affected by it?i want it out but waiting on a dr appt
4107,i'm 60 a -year old female who has suffered from severe leg and foot cramps at night as well as constipation for years.    i recently started taking an otc magnesium oxide supplement, 400 mg per day and it has helped me with those two issues (i don't have to take miralax anymore).    but i read recently that you should not take magnesium supplements if you have a slow heartrate which i have.    i've exercised my entire life (and continue to do so), so my resting heartrate is 54 bpm.    is it safe to continue taking the supplements?    i would hate to give them up as they'ved helped me so much.    would it be better if i took one pill every other day?    thank you.

4113,my wife went for her annual checkup in february 09 and her obgyn diagnosed her with possible cancer recommending total hysterectomy and removal of everthing. immediately my wife began to shut me out both emotionally and physically. before this time, we had a very loving and intimate life. my wife was 31 at this time and did not plan to have more children, although she loves children. we have 2 wonderful children. her obgyn did not recommend a second opinion and my wife put her total trust in him. in june 09 my wife had the surgery and nearly lost her life due to lose of blood from something going wrong during surgery that was to this day never explained to us on what exactly went wrong. my wife spent 4 days in icu on a ventilator and i feared i would lose her. she is the love of my life and i cherish her. life for us has not been the same, in a way i feel like the dr took my wife's soul away from her with regard to me. she treats everyone the same as before but me she treats differently. she is withdrawn from me. we have not been intimate in 15 months ever since the first diagnosis. i have tried to rationally talk to her but she seems to go on the defense and accuse me of telling her of her inadequacies when all i am trying to do is ask questions on how she feels and try to get her to open up emotionally and physically toward me. it breaks my heart. i love this woman and would die for her or my children. i almost feel as if i said bye to her the day she had the surgery. she has told me that she constantly feels like she is jumping out of her skin, cannot stand to be held or touched, has absolutely no libido or desire to even try intimate relations. i have noticed that she stares out in space a lot, she does not get a full nights sleep, has constant anxiety, constant severe headaches, constant tenderness of breasts, nausea, vomiting, and weight lose. i desire this woman so much that it is difficult to not be with your wife and the woman i love to be with the most. i want to help her so bad but do not know what to do. i do know that she has experienced grief toward feeling she has lost something cause she cannot stand to see babies and she loves babies and children. it has been 1 year since the surgery and some of these symptoms i have witnessed seem to be worsening. i have all but given up talking with her concerning intimacy and am afraid to do more than hug her or give her a peck for fear of pushing her away even though my desire is so much more. she has states that she cannot even hold or hug our children for long periods due to feeling smothered. she has since left her former obgyn due to the way he treated her after the surgery. she went for a check-up after the surgery and came home in a great deal of pain and crying and stated she felt as if he was trying to sweep her under the rug. she has since went to a new obgyn and the only thing she is prescribed is birth control and antidepressant wellebutrin. is there someone out there that can give me advice and answers as to how to help my wife or communicate with her without her defensiveness. i feel lost and long to be close to her. she is only 32 now and it has been 1 year since the surgery. now my wife is a very private person who does not open up very well and is very modest. i have never went to the dr with her nor do i know who her new dr is. i would love to help her to take care of the issues. any help please. i love this woman. how long can this surgical-menapause last or is she going through surgical-menapause?
4114,i had a total hysterectomy 1/07 and had a laprascopy on 4/07 due to a bump on my lower right side.    i can not wear dress slacks or jeans everything must be elastic because of this bump.    dr. said no hernia but bump is still there was referred to pain management.    pain management did not inject the area in question but gave me pain medication.    after six months of pain management he stated that i needed to go to a general surgeon because the swelling of the bump indicated hernia.    general surgeon said yes it is a hernia but i was dumbfounded so they requested cat scan of ab/pelvic.    results stated    rectus abdominis diastasis, the bump no answer.    i have pain on the right side and when touched more so.    the bump sometimes is more noticeable than others. i have been told that ct scans will not reveal the hernia but an ultrasound will.    i will be asking my physician to perform an ultrasound.    i was at my ob/gyn this past week she stated that the bump and the abd/diastasis are not related and she gave me a general surgeon but made no mention on what she thought of the pain and bump on my right side.    i am very confused and in pain. my primary physician has stated since the abd/diastasis is bothering me that i will need surgery.     any suggestions. thank you

4116,i had a tt on 12-18-07 with lipo to the flanks and hip area.    at first, everything seemed fine but now i have noticed as the day progresses my upper abs get really tight, sweel, are tender to the touch, while sometimes it is hard and other times gooshy.    at my three month post visit i mentioned this to the plastic surgeon and he basically said you need to do some exercises.    well, i have done that (work out with a personal trainer 2-3x a week, take pilates twice a week, & bosu twice a week) and watch what i eat.    no matter what exercise day or not come 7pm my upper abs are tender and swollen.    i am going to visit the plastic surgeon again next week but fear that he is just going to brush it off again.    any advice to what could be going on and should i be worried?this discussion is related tomini tummy tuck upper swelling.
4117,hello and thank you for reading my post.my father is a end stage renal disease (diagnosed 3 months ago) diabetic.when he was admitted for his renal problem 3 months ago, he caught c. diff.he dealt with it for 2 months and had to go back to the hospital.because of the renal issues his legs were swollen, which produced a large blister on his right foot.the blister got infected and he had pretty severe necrosis of the shin area which underwent debridement . the wound is currently filled with the sponge/vac machine which drains fluid (of reddish color). he has been with the vac for about 6 days.i just spoke to one of the doctors and says his protein count is low, so they are hooking him up to a nutritional iv. he also gets these amino acid sachets which his meals. when i asked the doctor if i could bring anything foodwise she said that the nutritionist is calculating how much protein he needs. after seeing the food they give to people in hospitals and i can't say i trust much the hospital nutritionist, hence i am doing my own research.the doctor said that it the wound does not heal sooner rather than later they will consider amputation in order to avoid further complication from being in bed so long (ulcers and so on).therefore, getting him the best nutrition possible to help his wound heal fast is very important.another thing: they want him to drink this ensure and boost drinks that have sugar as the 3rd ingredient (his sugar was in the 300s this afternoon). they say that he needs this for his immune system and for his leg to recover. is there better alternate supplements to get?anyone have any ideas about nutrition?ideas about preventing ulcers/damage from being in bed for too long?thank you.
4118,i am 35 years old and in good health. i had my mmr shots when i was a child and i am trying to enroll in a college now, and they need a copy of my immunization records. strangely enough, no one can find any record of my receiving the vaccine. i've tried previous employers, my high school, my doctor's office and the nys dept. of health. my mother is 100% sure that i got it.my question is: is it safe to get the shot again now? that seems to be my only option at this point, as i currently don't have insurance and cannot afford the $300 to get the bloodwork test performed. are there any risks, side effects or reasons that i should not get this shot again?any info on this matter at all would be greatly appreciated. thank you.
4119,dear reader,bpa is bad for you.there. i'll go out on a limb and just say it.your turn, fda.less than perfectin a perfect world we wouldn't do things backwards.in a perfect world the first person to smoke tobacco might wonder: could inhaling smoke into my lungs hurt me? and then, before going ahead to create a massive, international industry, he would conduct some tests to see if smoking might be a highly addictive habit that shortens life in the most hideous ways.but that's not our style.here in real world, scientists first synthesized bisphenol a (bpa) in the late 1800s. about 40 years later it was found to have estrogenic properties. a few years later, scientists figured ways to use bpa in making plastic containers and resins that now line most food and soft drink cans.but  uh oh  bpa polymer decays over time, so traces of the synthetic estrogen are released into canned foods and baby formula in plastic bottles. (bpa is also used to make pacifiers, plastic forks and spoons, plastic bowls, etc.)by the time researchers started studying the effects of bpa on animals, use of the chemical was in full swing. and wouldn't you know it    the animal tests suggested that bpa might not be real healthy. in fact, it might be real unhealthy, prompting reproductive and hormone-related problems.but those results were in a bunch of mice. what about humans?this past summer, fda officials handed down their judgment: no problem! let the bpa good times roll!but the party came to a sudden halt last month when a journal of the american medical association (jama) study concluded that high urinary bpa concentrations might be linked to increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and abnormal concentrations of liver enzymes. (according to a columbia university scientist, more than 90 percent of americans have detectable levels of bpa in their urine.)one doctor told abc news: if this does not close the door on the use of bpa in consumer products, i don't know what will.that's adorable.here's a more reliable take, from a jama editorial: one factor that may be contributing to the refusal of regulatory agencies to take action on bpa in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm from animal studies  is an aggressive disinformation campaign using techniques ('manufactured doubt') first developed by the lead, vinyl, and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists.and that's reality. and that's why the fda will do nothing at all to protect the public from the use of bpa. there's just too much money involved.do tellso forget about the fda riding to the rescue. this one is up to us. what's needed now is some water cooler regulation. that is: spread the word. tell your family, tell your friends, tell your coworkers    bpa is bad stuff.parents can find information about alternatives to bpa products for infants and younger kids at these websites: thesoftlanding.com, and zrecommends.com.and everyone can steer clear of bpa by avoiding as many foods as possible that come in cans and plastic containers. i know, that's a tall order. but as a heart doctor told abc news, the highly processed foods that are packaged in those containers are probably actually worse for the heart than bpa.
4120,i am 45 year old, i had a parture hysterectomy 8 years ago in which i still have my overies.    within the last 2 years i started having severe hot flashes like every 30-45 minutes during the day and at night, i get extremely hot and sweaty, nervous and frustated.    i have been on several different hrt's and experience different problems with some more than other.    presently i am taking estadoil, i have gain a lot of weight and i feel bloated all the time and i have headaches a lot.    most times i take one every other day instead of daily, i find myself itching and i break out in little red bumps with however, they will itch for about 10 minutes and then they disappear.    this happens 4-5 times a day and it is very annoying when you are around people and you are scratching all over your body.    i also have bad achne(acne)on my face every month.    what hrt should i use that might help with this issue also, once you have a    hysterectomy how long will you have to take or use hrt??    please help me soon!

4135,lately i have been feeling very ill after eating. as many have mentioned in other posts: i feel the need to vomit (although i don't), it's my whole stomach, then my body feels fatigue, i get shaky if i don't eat soon enough or even fast enough, sometimes a headache, sharp and burning mostly on the left side, often resulting in anxiety, i sometimes feel malnutrition but i know i'm pretty well balanced. i sometimes have a lump in my throat that won't leave till it leaves. nothing i have tried seems to help it. mostly it's nausea and pain with anxiety. the anxiety can be present before, during, but mostly after. kind of a build of symptoms....all this and never diarea(diarrhea).it usually happens during or shortly after a meal no matter what or how much i eat. even soup or salad.i have had a history of way over eating and much spicy food in my diet, however, lately i have made a serious effort to watch my habits. i use to eat till it hurt and i couldn't seem to stop myself ever. now i've started eating better. lots of home cooked meals. i need to be eating more veggies but it's still in the works. also, a history of anxiety. everyday or more than one attack a day. this has gone on longer than the pain though.at first it was all this pain but no anxiety all because i ate too much. now i eat properly and all these things have gotten worse. maybe something other then a stomach problem? it's as if it's perpetuated into something different and worse now that i have started to help myself.i have also gained a few extra pounds in the last 8 months. i can't tell you exactly when all this has started but it has become a serious issue in the last 6 months at least.if you know of a site of technic or anything to help please let me know. thank you.things not to post: don't post your story just to tell me you have the same problem. do not just tell me to see a doctor. i know and i will when i have money and time. (unless you think i should get a certain test done or something of that sort)

4140,on january 4 2011 i had an ipl laser treatment done under my eyes to help reduce dark circles, the skin is very thin due to damage from sun exposure.    the next day, my left eye started twitching on the bottom corner lid of the eye near the nose.    i ignored it and attributed it to stress, but after a month with no let up i called my dermatologist and was assured these non ablative lasers cannot penetrate deeply enough to cause any nerve damage.    so i let it go.    the condition has become worse, and now after three months of this, it has become obvious that this laser procedure did some kind of nerve damage.    the spasms are quite intense and only let up about 4 hours a day, when i close my eyes i can feel the muscle contracting.    when i put hot water on my face, both eyes go crazy, twitch and feel heavy for about five minutes.    i remember when i had a toothache due to a nerve the same sensation would happen when drinking hot coffee.i was told nerves take a long to heal (months and years), i have an appointment with a neuro-optho in six weeks and i'm sure he can help me with these questions, but in the mean time why is my brain sending a signal to the nerve to constantly contract this muscle under my eye?    how can i stop this as it's driving me crazy, i would really like to avoid botox or surgery. if the damage was really bad, i wouldn't feel anything, correct?    the muscle and the nerve wouldn't do a thing so something is going wacky.    my vision is 20/20 but it's a nuisance that is driving me nuts, any insight to how nerves/muscles heal etc would help relieve some of the stress, thanks!

4144,salmonella in your kitchen cabinetsmonday, march 15, 2010 8:07 amby sylvia booth hubbardthe fda continues to issue recalls on products possibly contaminated with salmonella that may be lurking in your kitchen cabinets.by monday the list had expanded to include more than 100 food products, and the list is expected to continue growing. the recalled foods include soups, snacks, dip mixes, stuffing mixes, and herb blends, and were sold in all 50 states.salmonella is an organism that can cause serious infections and even death in children and those with compromised immune systems. contaminated foods may not look or smell bad, but can cause short-term symptoms in healthy people that include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.products involved contain hydrolyzed vegetable protein (hvp), a flavor-enhancing ingredient which is used in thousands of food products. the contaminated hvp was manufactured by las vegas-based basic food flavors inc. according to the fda, the company continued to distribute hvp products after their own private testing in january revealed the presence of salmonella. the company began notifying customers of the problem on feb. 26, a week before the fda issued a public recall.since hvp is a common ingredient in almost all processed foods, consumers are urged to go to the fda's web site for breaking information. an up-to-date list of products on the recall list can be found here.some products recalled include:   all of the national pretzel company's honey mustard onion flavored pretzels.   rojo's garden fresh spinach dip.   kroger onion & soup dip mix.   pringles restaurant craver's cheeseburger chips.   trader joe's company chocolate chip chewy coated granola bars   t. marzetti southwest ranch veggie dipso far, no illnesses linked to the hvp have been reported, probably since many of the suspected products have been cooked at a high temperature, which kills the salmonella. still, some ready-to-eat foods create a greater risk.products containing black pepper sold in bulk and distributed by dutch valley food distributors are also being recalled due to traces of salmonella. the suspected pepper is included in many whole foods and frontier natural products spice blends.
4145,i had a lavh 12 years ago, one ovary left in place for hormone reasons.    i am 41 years old and have not gone through menopause yet.    the hysterectomy was done for endometriosis.    i have always had normal pap smears, and continued to have them done yearly after the hysterectomy.    i had my annual done 2 weeks ago and received a call monday that it came back showing lgsil and hpv high risk positive.    she stated i should come in for a colposcopy to look at my cervix, so i had to remind her that i don't have a cervix.    my question is what are the consequences to these test results if i don't have a cervix?    are there the same implications to the vagina?    i am not sure if i should be worried or not, what kind of treatment can be done, and just exactly what this means.    any information or direction to find info would be appreciated.    all of the info i keep finding doesn't address this situation in hysterectomy patients, it is all about women who have their cervix.thanksmissy
4146,to all those going in for vag/hys my doc told me the vagina is very forgiving, so if they should nick soomething like the bladder they can stitch it and it heals and i feel much better knowing it would not be any worse than possibly having to go home with a catheter for a couple weeks.....thats not the worst thing to me and i thought you may get relief with this info too.

4149,my 14 year old son broke both bones in his arm above the wrist this afternoon.    he did not sustain any wounds to the skin.    his last tetanus shot was in 1999.    the doctor felt that it was not a risk for tetanus in his case.    would he still be protected if his last tetanus was 9 years ago?    has there ever been a tetanus infection from a broken bone without external contusions?    how long does someone have to get a tetanus booster after an injury occurs--before tetanus can set in?thanks for any help,summerforest

4155,gm products are no bargain  at any priceas food prices soar and shortages of essential grains increase, i'm more than a little concerned that we could see increased acceptance of genetically modified crops. and you should be concerned, too.many governments and food companies have displayed common sense in avoiding genetically-tinkered foods, but now they may feel the pressure in their wallets to accept them.let's hope that doesn't turn out to be the case. it could very well prove to be one of the worst things imaginable for your health. no one has any idea what the long-term consequences are for messing with the genes of various organisms  mixing and matching at will  and then giving the byproduct to humans to eat.it's one of the many reasons that the european union is adamantly opposed to these foods finding their way into the food supply. the eu has been successful thus far in resisting them.but that resistance could soon be tested. gm crops are less expensive and tend to include corn and soy  ingredients in a vast array of processed-food junk on supermarket shelves. even wheat is being eyed for genetic modification so it can be had on the cheap. (all the more reason to stick with meat from grass-fed animals.)the biotech companies are no doubt rubbing their hands in anticipation of continued food shortages. fortunately, you don't have to buy what they're selling. honor those companies that won't include gm foods in their ingredients. look for no gmos that many list on their packaging.dr. a. i.

4163,hi i went to acupuncturist last week. i have been in pain ever since. she put in needles without alcohol swabbing in my elbow crease area on r and l arm, and    straight on side of index finger in addition to sides of feet near big toe. i had tingling sensations and uncomfortable ever since. i have uncomfortable tingling in my left arm and left wrist, it was difficult to type with both hands without a weird uncomfortable sensation for first 3 days including intermittent pins and needles in both my feet. after 4th or 5th day the weird sensations in hands and arms turned to pain. i still have slight tingling in my right hand and soreness in right upper arm is still there. when i walk and swing my arms, i can feel the same odd sensations in both of my arms to hands. fine motor skills are slightly weakened in the right hand particularly because of uncomfortable sensations which i found out from an md to be due to radial nerve damage as a result of acupuncture. there is slight tingling behind my left knee as i walk and when i try to point my toes there will be an uncomfortable tingling sensation in my feet. these effects really concern me as i have been always healthy for all my life and have never had any prior health problems at the level of this severity previously. these sensations are uncomfortable and unbearable and i can only hope they do not continue.    i have pain in hands just in typing this question. my question is: do you think it is possible to make a full recovery? feel free to comment on anything else..look forward to your input, thank you!!

4169,daily use of high-dose vitamin c supplements may increase the risk of cataracts.    an eight-year swedish study of 25,593 women showed a 25% increase in cataract removals among those taking vitamin c supplementation (approximately 1,000 mg per day) compared to those who did not.    a smaller, but non-significant increase was seen among those taking a multivitamin.    women taking vitamin c supplements for at least 10 years prior to the study had even higher increases in cataract removals (46% increase), as did those on hormone replacement therapy or corticosteroids.

4171,our 3.5 mth baby girl was placed on alimentum & rice cereal due to relflux.    she currently has started eating maybe .5-1 oz of a 4 oz bottle.    she will grin and play with the nipple for a while and then she starts to get fussy.    sometimes we have to feed her bit by bit before she will drink the entire bottle.    maybe 2-3 feedings will she take the entire bottle.    also the peditrician has recently prescribe zantac to help with the reflux.    is this normal,    has she become a picky eater or is there an underlying problem?
